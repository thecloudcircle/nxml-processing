To accomplish its goals, numerous committee activities are underway,<xref rid="jgf2271-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, one of which is the Committee for International Affairs (CIA).</p><p>The CIA introduced the international session at its 2012 annual conference. The CIA considered active international interaction critical to the responsible mission of the JPCA and determined that presentation of clinical and research work in English would provide opportunities for researchers to enhance their skills in domestic and international healthcare environments. Session organizers and chairs use the CIA sessions as opportunities for meaningful interactions among primary care physicians and trainees in Japan and other countries.</p><p>Trends in the presentations and the characteristics of the participating presenters are important factors to the CIA in its yearly preparation for the annual conference. Thus, the history of the international sessions provides useful insights for the CIA. The CIA encourages active participation in the sessions by domestic and international primary care scholars, and it believes that it is important to share the session goals and the accomplishments derived from the international session to support the participating scholars. This activity is believed to help them use the international session as a future resource.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="jgf2271-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><p>The data used for the analysis were derived from the abstracts of the presentations given at the international session of the JPCA annual conference from 2012 through 2018. The conference organizer provided the abstracts. Every abstract was reviewed by the primary investigator (N.H.), and the outcome of the review was confirmed by another investigator (N.B.). Following characteristics were identified: (a) type of presentation (oral or poster), (b) category of presentation (research, clinical case, activity, or article review), and (c) presenters' geographic area. The research design was also categorized. A descriptive analysis on the type of presentation, category of presentation, and geographic area was performed. Using regression analysis, the study assessed trend on: (a) the total number of presentations across time, (b) oral or poster type, and (c) presenters' national affiliation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="jgf2271-sec-0007"><label>3</label><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were eight international sessions at the JPCA annual conference. Initially, they were limited to oral presentations and the poster presentation format was not added until 2015. Altogether, 105 presentations were given: 57 were oral (Table <xref rid="jgf2271-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) and 48 were posters (Table <xref rid="jgf2271-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>).

The purpose of the international session is to enhance active global collaboration. It is important to gain academic support and exchange of expertise in primary health care that is to improve public health and health care.<xref rid="jgf2271-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jgf2271-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Our efforts to promote international collaborations through the international sessions accelerate this global goal attainment.</p><p>Based on the results, it is timely to consider higher quality research activities for presentation in the international session. Methodological robustness is important to research quality, but the designs used for primary care research might not conform to the established approaches, such as randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies. Our results found that more than two&#x02010;thirds (69%) of the research used cross&#x02010;sectional questionnaire. These designs clearly can be improved to produce higher quality evidence. Further, more methodological variety is needed to answer many of the clinical questions in the primary care field because of the breadth of primary health care. A previous study found that an international research network contributed to research capability.<xref rid="jgf2271-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> The JPCA's annual conference international sessions should support this network building.</p><p>Although the numbers of presenters from around the world with Japanese majority increased, Japanese presentations increased more than foreign ones (Table <xref rid="jgf2271-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We should appeal to our international colleagues, particularly to those in the Asia&#x02010;Pacific regions to promote international interactions in Asia, where scholarly activity has been less productive than in North America or Europe.<xref rid="jgf2271-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> This might boost collaboration and motivation for progress in the scientific aspect of primary care in the target region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="jgf2271-sec-0011"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We are encouraged by the significant annual increases of international presentations in the international session of the JPCA annual conferences, but several concerns emerged from this study that need to be solved. The international session should be used more for scholarly networking, as methodological learning opportunities, and to present educational research. These weaknesses might be addressed by enriching future sessions, which also might enhance primary care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="jgf2271-sec-0012"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors have stated explicitly that there are no conflicts of interest in connection with this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="jgf2271-sup-0001"><caption><p>&#x000a0;</p></caption><media xlink:href="JGF2-20-257-s001.TIF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="jgf2271-sup-0002"><caption><p>&#x000a0;</p></caption><media xlink:href="JGF2-20-257-s002.TIF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="jgf2271-sup-0003"><caption><p>&#x000a0;</p></caption><media xlink:href="JGF2-20-257-s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="jgf2271-sec-0013"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>We thank Dr. Tadao Okada, Dr. Yosuke Takemura, Dr. Hiroyuki Kobayashi, Dr. Toshio Naito, Dr. Yuko Takeda, Dr. Haruhiro Uematsu, Dr. Tsuneari Hayashi, Dr. Hiroshi Takagi, and Dr. Shunzo Koizumi for assistance throughout all aspect of our study and for their help in the JPCA international session.
