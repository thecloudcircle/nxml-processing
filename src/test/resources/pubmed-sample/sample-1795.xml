Type I and type IV cadherins in this family function at adherens junctions in the major epithelial tissues of vertebrates and insects, respectively, but they have distinct, relatively simple domain organizations that are thought to have evolved by independent reductive changes from an ancestral type III cadherin, which is larger than derived paralogs and has a complicated domain organization. Although both type III and type IV cadherins have been identified in hexapods and branchiopods, the process by which the type IV cadherin evolved is still largely unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Through an analysis of arthropod genome sequences, we found that the only classical cadherin encoded in chelicerate genomes was the type III cadherin and that the two <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes found in the spider <italic>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</italic> genome exhibited a complex yet ancestral exon-intron organization in arthropods. Genomic and transcriptomic data from branchiopod, copepod, isopod, amphipod, and decapod crustaceans led us to redefine the type IV cadherin category, which we separated into type IVa and type IVb, which displayed a similar domain organization, except type IVb cadherins have a larger number of extracellular cadherin (EC) domains than do type IVa cadherins (nine versus seven). We also showed that <italic>type IVa cadherin</italic> genes occurred in the hexapod, branchiopod, and copepod genomes whereas only <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes were present in malacostracans. Furthermore, comparative characterization of the type IVb cadherins suggested that the presence of two extra EC domains in their N-terminal regions represented primitive characteristics. In addition, we identified an evolutionary loss of two highly conserved cysteine residues among the type IVa cadherins of insects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provide a genomic perspective of the evolution of classical cadherins among bilaterians, with a focus on the Arthropoda, and suggest that following the divergence of early arthropods, the precursor of the insect type IV cadherin evolved through stepwise reductive changes from the ancestral type III state. In addition, the complementary distributions of polarized genomic characters related to type IVa/IVb cadherins may have implications for our interpretations of pancrustacean phylogeny.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12862-017-0991-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cadherin</kwd><kwd>Cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>Adherens junction</kwd><kwd>Arthropod</kwd><kwd>Chelicerate</kwd><kwd>Crustacean</kwd><kwd>Insect</kwd><kwd>Genome</kwd><kwd>Evolution</kwd><kwd>Phylogeny</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)</institution></funding-source><award-id>23370095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oda</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)</institution></funding-source><award-id>15K07139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oda</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)</institution></funding-source><award-id>24870035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akiyama-Oda</surname><given-names>Yasuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)</institution></funding-source><award-id>26440130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akiyama-Oda</surname><given-names>Yasuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Classical cadherins, a metazoan-specific subfamily of the cadherin superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], are homophilic cell-cell adhesion molecules that play key roles in metazoan morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and as single-pass transmembrane proteins, their ectodomains contain repetitive extracellular cadherin (EC) domains that function to recognize and bind cells that express the same or similar cadherin molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The cytoplasmic domains of classical cadherins also bind to catenins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], through which they interact with the actomyosin network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and potentially integrate actomyosin-generated physical forces into tissue-level tension, thereby regulating tissue homeostasis and morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Genes that encode classical cadherins have been identified in many bilaterian species, as well as in several non-bilaterian metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and studies in both vertebrate and insect models have firmly established the role and mechanisms of classical cadherins in animal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, despite the conservation of their functions, classical cadherins exhibit remarkable variation in the structure of their ectodomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and members of the classical cadherin family have been categorized as types I, II, III, and IV, or otherwise, based on their phylogenetic grouping and domain organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Type I and type II cadherins each possess five tandem EC domains, and these cadherin types are common in vertebrates but have not been reported to occur in invertebrates, with the exception of urochordates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Certain subtypes of type I and type II cadherins, including E-cadherin (type I) and cadherin-5 or VE-cadherin (type II), serve as components of adherens junctions in vertebrate epithelial tissues. However, type IV cadherins function as the key adhesion molecules of adherens junctions in insect epithelial tissues and include the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> E-cadherin, DE-cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), which is the representative type IV cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Type IV cadherins are characterized by their shared domain organization, which includes seven EC domains, followed by the non-chordate classical cadherin (NC), cysteine-rich EGF-like (CE), and laminin-G (LG) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and they have been identified in insects, non-insect hexapods (e.g., collembolan) and branchiopod crustaceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Importantly, recent studies have revealed that the structural mechanisms responsible for homophilic binding of type I/II and type IV cadherins are quite different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, type III cadherins are distributed among a wide range of bilaterian metazoans, including arthropods, echinoderms, and even vertebrates, but they have yet to be identified in non-bilaterian metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The representative type III cadherin is <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> neural cadherin, DN-cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), the expression and function of which primarily occurs in non-epithelial tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In contrast to type I, II, and IV cadherins, type III cadherin molecules contain 14 to 17 EC domains followed by the ectodomain, which includes one NC, three CE (CE1-CE3), and two LG (LG1 and LG2) domains with the following organization: NC-CE1-LG1-CE2-LG2-CE3. In addition, non-categorized/unconventional forms of classical cadherins have also been reported to occur in nematodes, hemichordates, and cephalochordates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Although up to 17 EC domains have been observed in the classical cadherins of bilaterians, 25 or more have been reported in the classical cadherin-encoding genes of non-bilaterian metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Genomic and domain organization of classical cadherins in <italic>Parasteatoda tepidariorum and Strigamia maritima</italic>. <bold>a</bold>.

</p><p>The structural variation of the ectodomains of classical cadherins is thought to have resulted from domain losses that occurred at critical points in metazoan or bilaterian evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This hypothesis is based on the conclusion that the type III form represents the last common precursor of all bilaterian classical cadherins, a conclusion that is supported by the widespread, albeit scattered, phylogenetic distribution of <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes among bilaterians, detectable conservation throughout the amino acid sequences of type III cadherins, and the observation that all other forms of cadherins can be recognized as derived states of the type III form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether the various forms of classical cadherins were present in the last common ancestors of the individual phyla, as well as whether the currently recognized derived states, i.e., the type I/II and type IV cadherins, evolved from the ancestral type III state during a distinct event or through progressive evolution. Efforts to answer these questions may contribute to a better understanding of how the structural mechanisms of classical cadherin-mediated adhesion evolved in metazoans and at what points of animal evolution the adhesion mechanisms were changed or modified.</p><p>To address these questions, we focused on the phylum Arthropoda, in which growing volumes of genomic and transcriptomic sequence resources are available for a broad range of species. We investigated both genomic and transcriptomic classical cadherin-encoding sequences from a wide range of arthropod and non-arthropod bilaterians, including chelicerates, a myriapod, and several non-branchiopod crustaceans, to determine whether <italic>type IV cadherin</italic> genes evolved from <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes before, during, or after the early divergence of arthropods, and whether type IV cadherins arose from the type III state abruptly or through an intermediate state (or several intermediate states).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>Classical cadherin</italic> genes in the chelicerate <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> genome</title><p>In the present study, we first identified a <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> (common house spider formerly known as <italic>Achaearanea tepidariorum</italic>) type III cadherin-encoding cDNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) that was distinct from a copy of At-cadherin cDNA previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, the previously identified At-cadherin was redesignated Pt1-cadherin, and the newly identified gene product was designated Pt2-cadherin.</p><p>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> embryos at stages 5 and 10 demonstrated that the Pt1- and Pt2-cadherin transcripts were expressed in both early and late embryonic stages and that, at both stages, the expression level of the <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> gene was greater than that of the <italic>Pt1-cadherin</italic> gene (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S1, S2). The predicted Pt1- and Pt2-cadherins were 2985 and 2961 amino acids long, respectively, and the sequences could be aligned along their entire lengths, exhibiting 66% identity. These sequences could also be aligned with the DN-cadherin sequence; however, the N-terminal regions appeared to have diverged. Using a protein domain search of the PROSITE database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we detected 17 and 16 EC domains in the Pt1- and Pt2-cadherin sequences, respectively, and two LG domains in each. Next, we aligned the sequences of the EC repeats (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1) and defined the start and end positions of the individual EC domains, which were numbered from 1 to 17 (EC1 to EC17). The more C-terminal regions of the Pt1- and Pt2-cadherins were subdivided into eight domains (NC, CE1, LG1, CE2, LG2, CE3, TM, and CP; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>; Figure S1). Although some NC domain sequences in classical cadherins have been reported to exhibit weak similarities to typical EC domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the NC domain was not considered an EC domain in this work because of its limited sequence similarity. Practically, the positions of the domains of DN-cadherin and other type III cadherins were defined based on sequence alignment with the Pt1- and Pt2-cadherins.</p><p>To investigate the genomic organization of the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes, we used scaffold sequences of the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> isolate G&#x000f6;ttingen genome (~1.4 Gbp) (GCA_000365465.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], as well as whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) reads of the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> isolate Osaka genome (&#x0003e;31&#x000d7; coverage) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The full-length nucleotide sequence of the Pt1- cadherin cDNA was mapped to the ~488 Kbp region of Scaffolds 55 and 753, which could be connected into a continuous sequence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and contained at least 35 exons that were separated by introns of various sizes (from 444&#x000a0;bp to more than 240 Kbp). Similarly, the full-length nucleotide sequence of the <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> transcript was mapped to the ~298 Kbp region of Scaffold 493 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), and we found that the <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> gene contained at least 36 exons that were separated by introns of various sizes (from 75&#x000a0;bp to more than 140 Kbp). Most, but not all, of the exons in both genes were small (&#x0003c;400&#x000a0;bp), and all of the introns in the protein-coding regions of the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2- cadherin</italic> genes were inserted at homologous sites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). In addition, the total lengths of the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes were much larger than the total length of the <italic>DN-cadherin</italic> gene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>); however, the three genes shared at least 13 intron insertion sites, including those for the largest introns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p>To investigate whether a third <italic>classical cadherin</italic> gene was present in the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> genome, we exhaustively searched the genome <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> isolate G&#x000f6;ttingen genome sequence assembly and reads from the <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> isolate Osaka WGS and RNA-seq. However, there was no sign of a third <italic>classical cadherin</italic> gene in <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic>, which led us to conclude that the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes are the only <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes in the species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Identification of <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes in other non-hexapod arthropod genomes</title><p>To investigate the repertoire of <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes in other non-hexapod arthropod genomes, we searched the publicly available genome sequence assemblies of four chelicerate species (velvet spider <italic>Stegodyphus mimosarum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; two-spotted mite <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; western predatory mite <italic>Metaseiulus occidentalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; <italic>Mesobuthus martensii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), a myriapod species (centipede <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]), and four crustacean species (water flea <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]; copepod <italic>Eurytemora affinis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; amphipod <italic>Hyalella azteca</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; amphipod <italic>Parhyale hawaiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The capability to detect the entire organization of <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes depended on the quality of the genome sequence assembly and the availability of rich transcriptomic resources. The genome sequence assemblies that were searched comprised scaffolds or contigs with relatively high N50 values and relatively low proportions of undetermined bases. Although transcript models for classical cadherins were predicted in many of the genome sequence assemblies, we carefully evaluated the organization of all detectable <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes. RNA-seq reads, if publicly available and necessary, were used to reconstruct the transcript sequence of classical cadherins. In addition to the publicly available sequence resources, we generated RNA-seq reads for both sea slater <italic>Ligia exotica</italic> and freshwater shrimp <italic>Caridina multidentata</italic>, as well as WGS reads with approximately 8&#x000d7; and 13&#x000d7; coverage depths, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S1, S3).

The Sm2-cadherin was considered a type III cadherin, and its exon-intron structure was similar, but not identical, to that of the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes, although a small portion of the coding sequence was not mapped to any scaffold (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). In contrast, Sm1-cadherin exhibited most of the typical type III cadherin elements, but since it contained only 12 EC domains, it could be classified as neither a type III nor a type IV cadherin.

Notably, Le1-cadherin was structurally similar to type IV cadherins in that it lacked the CE2, LG2, and CE3 domains that are typical of type III cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3).

To investigate this question, we performed cell aggregation assays using <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells transiently transfected with or without a Le1-cadherin expression construct (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The result indicated that Le1-cadherin was capable of mediating cell-cell adhesion.</p><p>A <italic>classical cadherin</italic> gene specifically related to the <italic>Le1-cadherin</italic> gene was also identified in each of the <italic>H. azteca</italic> and <italic>P. hawaiensis</italic> genomes. Both these predicted products had essentially the same domain organization as Le1-cadherin, and they were designated Ha1- and Ph1-cadherin, respectively, (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3). The <italic>Le1-</italic>, <italic>Ha1-</italic> and <italic>Ph1-cadherin</italic> genes exhibited a relatively complex yet mutually similar exon-intron organization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

However, since the <italic>C. multidentata</italic> RNA-seq data poorly represented sequences specifically related to Le1-cadherin, we were unable to generate a predicted transcript.

These contigs were connected by some raw reads, indicating that the <italic>C. multidentata</italic> genome might have another <italic>classical cadherin</italic> gene, which had retained domain elements characteristic of type III cadherin, rather than type IV cadherin.</p><p>In the genome sequence assembly of the copepod <italic>E. affinis</italic>, two hypothetical <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes were detected, and their predicted products were designated Ea1- and Ea2-cadherin (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Ea2-cadherin was a type III cadherin, whereas Ea1-cadherin was a type IV cadherin that had essentially the same domain organization as those of DE- and Dp1-cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Redefinition of the type IV cadherin category</title><p>For simplicity and convenience, we redefined the term &#x0201c;type IV cadherin.&#x0201d; Irrespective of the total number of EC domains, all the classical cadherins that were characterized by the absence of the CE2, LG2, and CE3 domains were included in the type IV category, and the category was also separated into two subclasses, type IVa and type IVb, based on differences in their EC domains. More specifically, type IVa cadherins were defined as type IV cadherins that contain seven EC domains, whereas type IVb cadherins were defined as type IV cadherins that contain the same seven EC domains as well as two more EC domains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The validity of this classification will be further examined below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Relationships among the domain organizations of type II, III, IVa, and IVb cadherins</title><p>To systematically detect the possible homologous regions between the diverse classical cadherins in various arthropods and other bilaterians, we searched for collinear arrangements of similarities between their amino acid sequences using blast-based dot-plot comparisons with the amino acid sequences of the Pt1- and Pt2-cadherins as the reference sequences. Using a sliding window of 120 amino acids, we generated a series of overlapping sequences from the entire amino acid sequences of DN-, Sm1-, Le1-, and DE-cadherins, <italic>Pundamilia nyererei</italic> (teleost fish) Pn-cadherin (vertebrate type III), and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mammal) Mm5-cadherin (also known as VE-cadherin; vertebrate type II). The serial sequences were then blasted against each reference (i.e., Pt1- and Pt2-cadherin), and the resulting E-values at the blast-hit positions were plotted to visualize the collinearity and identify evolutionarily conserved regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Blast-based dot-plot comparisons of classical cadherin amino acid sequences.

</p><p>The resulting dot-plots indicated that DN-cadherin is well conserved with the chelicerate type III cadherins throughout its length and that Pn-cadherin has 14 EC domains that correspond to the EC4-EC17 domains of Pt1- and Pt2-cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the three Pn-cadherin (vertebrate type III) EC domains that corresponded to the EC1-EC3 domains of arthropod type III cadherins were too divergent to detect. To avoid confusion, however, the EC domains of all the type III cadherins in the present study were numbered based on the detected collinear arrangements with the numbered EC domains of Pt1- and Pt2-cadherin (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). The blast-based dot-plot comparisons revealed correspondence between the EC1-EC6 region of the type IVa cadherins and the EC8-EC13 region of the type III cadherins, as well as between the EC7-LG region of the type IVa cadherins and the EC17-LG1 region of the type III cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, although the conservation between the EC9-LG region of Le1-cadherin and the EC17-LG1 region of the type III cadherins was evident, the comparisons of Le1-cadherin against the Pt1- and Pt2-cadherins yielded less clear patterns than were observed for some of the other comparisons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition, the five EC domains of the type II Mm5-cadherin yielded weak but specifically detectable collinear plots with the five C-terminal EC domains of Pt2-cadherin, although the pattern was less clear in the comparison of Mm5- and Pt1-cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p>Since the difficulty of aligning the Le1-cadherin sequence might have stemmed from its divergence from the Pt1- and Pt2-cadherin sequences, we also compared the Le1-cadherin sequence to the sequences of the DE-, Dp1-, Sm1-, Cm-, Le2-, DN-, and Pn-cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These comparisons provided clearer patterns of collinearity and revealed correspondences between the EC3-EC9 region of Le1-cadherin and the EC1-EC7 region of the type IVa cadherins, although the sequence of the Le1-cadherin EC8 domain appeared to diverge from that of the type IVa cadherin EC6 domain. The correspondence between the EC1-EC5 region of Le1-cadherin and the EC6-EC10 region of the type III cadherins and between the EC2-EC5 region of both Le1-cadherin and Sm1-cadherin were also supported (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, green boxes), whereas the EC6-EC8 region of Le1-cadherin demonstrated ambiguous affinities to the EC11-EC13, EC12-EC14, and EC14-EC16 regions of the type III cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, blue boxes). Nonetheless, the correspondence between the EC6-EC7 regions of the Le1- and Sm1-cadherins was specifically supported. Similar results were also obtained with the other type IVb cadherins (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S5).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Blast-based dot-plot comparisons between the amino acid sequence of Le1-cadherin and those of other classical cadherins.

</p><p>As previously mentioned (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), there were 34 introns inserted in the respective coding regions of the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes, and all of the intron insertions were located at identical sites between the two genes. Notably, 33 of the 34 intron insertion sites were shared among four or more of the non-chelicerate bilaterian genes examined (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, red, yellow and green lines), and of those 33 intron insertion sites, only six were specific to arthropods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, yellow lines), and two were shared only with non-arthropod genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, green lines). Despite the differences in domain organization, six of the 10 intron insertions in the <italic>type II cadherin</italic> gene were conserved in the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes, as well as in the gastropod and echinoderm <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, red and green lines). Among the arthropod genes, eight intron insertion sites were conserved between the <italic>type III</italic> and <italic>type IV cadherin</italic> genes but were missing in the spider and non-arthropod <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, blue lines). Taken together, these observations indicated that many of the introns in the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes were inherited in a complex ancestral state rather than acquired via lineage-specific gains of introns and suggested that at least 33 of the 34 introns in the <italic>Pt1-</italic> and <italic>Pt2-cadherin</italic> genes predate the earliest divergence of extant arthropod groups.</p><p>Notably, comparisons between the exon-intron organizations of type IVb and arthropod type III cadherins in their EC coding regions revealed marked conservation between them despite their divergence at the amino acid sequence level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S6), while the ancestral patterns of intron insertions were less conserved in <italic>type IVa cadherin</italic> genes. The EC10-EC13 coding regions of arthropod <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes contained eight conserved intron insertions, seven of which were conserved in the EC5-EC8 coding region of the <italic>Le1-cadherin</italic> and other <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S6). Similarly, the EC1 coding region of the <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes had two intron insertion sites conserved in the EC6 coding region of some of the pancrustacean <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes (i.e., the <italic>Le2-</italic> and <italic>Cm-cadherin</italic> genes). These observations, together with the results of the blast-based dot-plot comparisons, strongly suggested that the EC1-EC7 region of type IVb cadherins and the adjacent EC8 domain were homologous to the EC6-EC12 region of type III cadherins and the adjacent EC13 domain.</p><p>Despite the simple exon-intron organization of the <italic>DE-</italic> and <italic>Dp1-cadherin</italic> genes, some other type IVa cadherins shared a considerable number of intron insertions with <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, red, yellow, and blue lines). This finding indicated that the <italic>type IVa cadherin</italic> genes had experienced varying degrees of intron loss, depending on their specific lineage.

The patterns for type IVb cadherins in the blast-based dot-plot comparisons indicated the divergence of their amino acid sequences. Although the EC1-EC2 region of type IVb cadherins was shown to exhibit the highest affinity to the EC6-EC7 region of type III cadherins among the classical cadherins examined, it might be possible that the N-terminal two EC domains in type IVb cadherins have a unique history. To test this possibility, we blasted the amino acid sequences of the EC1-EC2 region, as well as of the EC3-EC4 region, of Le1-, Ha1- and Ph1-cadherin against the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) protein databases for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S4). In all but one of the blast results, the top hit proteins were type III classical cadherins, and the hit sites were consistent with the detected collinear similarities between the type III and type IVb cadherin EC domains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S5). These findings strongly suggested that the EC1-EC2 region of the type IVb cadherins shares a relatively recent common history with the EC6-EC7 region of the type III cadherins, and is compatible with the presence of conserved intron insertions in the EC1 coding region of the <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes and the EC6 coding region of the <italic>Le2-</italic> and <italic>Cm-cadherin</italic> genes.</p><p>Furthermore, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the amino acid sequences of five different extracellular regions (including three EC regions and two non-EC regions) of arthropod type III, type IVa, type IVb and Sm1-cadherins using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The results of these analyses revealed the separation of type IVa/IVb cadherins from type III cadherins as well as the separation of type IVb cadherins from type IVa cadherins. The data from all the different regions consistently indicated deep divergence between type IVa and type IVb cadherins, validating the classification of these type IV cadherin subtypes.

We also identified six cysteine residues that were specific to the EC5, EC8 and EC9 domains of type IVb cadherins and two cysteine residues that were specific to the EC8 domain of hexapod type IVa cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S8). The lineage-specific cysteine residues of the type III cadherins included two consecutive cysteine residues in the EC7 domain of arthropods and annelids/molluscans (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), as well as two other consecutive cysteine residues in the EC14 domain, which was limited to arthropods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).

However, these cysteine residues were also found in a predicted classical cadherin of the non-bilaterian metazoan <italic>T. adhaerens</italic>.

It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that, among the various forms of classical cadherin, the type III form is the only one known to have been passed on from the last common ancestor to both the arthropod and echinoderm lineages and that the same form is also the only one known to have been passed on from the earliest arthropods to all the major extant arthropod groups.</p><p>Importantly, these hypotheses provide an explanation for the relationships between the various states of classical cadherin domain organization and exon-intron organization observed both within and beyond the Arthropoda.

This finding led us to propose a revision of the type IV cadherin category and to define two subclasses, type IVa and type IVb. This classification was validated based on comparative and phylogenetic analyses of the arthropod classical cadherins.</p><p>The identification and characterization of type IVb cadherin provided an opportunity to discuss the transition from the ancestral type III cadherin to the insect type IVa cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>), which is often referred to as E-cadherin. Comparative data presented in this and previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] suggest that the origination of the last common precursor of type IVa and IVb cadherins was associated with a duplication of a preexisting <italic>type III cadherin</italic> gene followed by, or coupled with, the following three changes: the loss of 3 EC domains from the region corresponding to the EC13-EC16 region of type III cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Change A), the loss of the region corresponding to the CE2-LG2-CE3 region of type III cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Change B), and the gain of the C-terminal motif E-S-W-C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Change C).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Reconstruction of the evolution of the various forms of classical cadherin in arthropods. <bold>a</bold>.

The two extra EC domains of type IVb cadherin, which are missing in the type IVa cadherin, were characterized as part of a stretch of EC domains that had been inherited from the ancestral type III cadherin. This indicates that the last common type IVa/IVb cadherin precursor possessed, in addition to the seven EC domains, two EC domains corresponding to the type III cadherin EC6 and EC7 domains.

</p><p>Our dot-plot and genomic data indicated that both type IVa and type IVb cadherins have tandem EC domains that were derived from the EC8-EC12 region of type III cadherin, and our phylogenetic analyses based on amino acid alignment and substitution supported deep divergence between type IVa and type IVb cadherins. The key issue is what form the last common precursor of type IVa and type IVb cadherins had. There are two lines of evidence for the primitiveness of the type IVb subtype. First, the amino acid sequences of the two extra EC domains (the EC1-EC2 regions) of type IVb cadherins exhibit specific affinities to those of the EC6-EC7 regions of type III cadherins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S4). Second, the <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes have retained many intron insertions that are shared with the arthropod <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Notably, the conservation of two intron insertion sites in the EC1 coding region of the <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes and the EC6 coding region of the <italic>type III Cm-</italic> and <italic>Le2-cadherin</italic> genes suggest a specific association between the type IVb and type III forms. Altogether, the occurrence of these primitive characters in the <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes is most easily understood if we consider that the two N-terminal-most EC domains and subsequent (at least) five EC domains of the type IVb cadherin are composed of a continuous stretch of EC domains that were inherited from the ancestral type III cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). This interpretation does not necessarily indicate that the last common precursor of type IVa and type IVb cadherins was a type IVb cadherin but does indicate that it could have at least nine EC domains. If this is the case, the transition from the last common precursor of type IVa and type IVb cadherins to type IVa cadherin should have occurred through the loss of two EC domains corresponding to the EC6-EC7 region of type III cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Change D). Duplication of the precursor gene and subsequent differential loss of paralogs might have potentially occurred during the processes that gave rise to the type IVa and type IVb cadherin subtypes in the different crustacean lineages. Despite the primitive characteristics of the type IVb subtype, it could also be hypothesized that type IVb cadherin evolved from type IVa cadherin. Indeed, in the vertebrate lineage, 7-EC non-classical cadherins (e.g., LI-cadherin) are reported to have arisen from a 5-EC cadherin by internal domain duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, our comparative and phylogenetic analyses of type IVa and type IVb cadherins yielded no sign to support such a scenario. As another possibility, gene conversion might have led to a lineage-specific addition of two EC domains to the type IVa cadherin form. However, considering the determined characteristics of the EC1-EC2 coding regions of the <italic>type IVb cadherin</italic> genes, such a genetic event is much less likely to have occurred than the proposed domain loss event (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Change D).</p><p>The predicted Sm1-cadherin could be categorized as neither a type III nor type IV classical cadherin. Because this cadherin, similar to type IVb cadherins, lacks the five EC domains that correspond to the EC1-EC5 region of type III cadherin, we considered whether Sm1-cadherin and the type IVb cadherins share a common precursor. However, we were unable to identify any specific signature that supported such a hypothesis. To fill the possible gaps in reconstruction of the transition processes between type III and type IVa/IVb cadherins, more data from the myriapod group, as well as from the crustacean group, will be required.</p><p>The evolutionary conservation of cysteine residues has been previously reported among type I cadherins or among protocadherins, and conserved cysteine residues are apparently involved in intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds that contribute to the maintenance or stabilization of functional structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In the present study, our comparative analysis revealed phylogenetically stable, yet varied, patterns of cysteine residues among the metazoan classical cadherins, which might imply transitions of structural mechanisms during classical cadherin evolution. We found that the CE domains of all insect type IVa cadherins specifically lacked two highly conserved cysteine residues. The relationship of the insect type IVa cadherins with other classical cadherins clearly indicated that the simpler pattern of cysteine residues in the CE domains of the insect type IVa cadherins is a derived state that was produced by the evolutionary loss of two cysteine residues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Change E). Therefore, we suggest that the transition from the ancestral type III cadherin to the derived insect type IVa cadherin was a multistep process that involved several progressive reductive changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Directionality in the evolution of the classical cadherin structure</title><p>Accumulated evidence from the arthropods and chordates suggests that the lineage-specific forms of classical cadherin have been shaped by reductive changes from an ancestral type III cadherin. The genomes of certain non-bilaterian metazoans are known to contain genes encoding much larger classical cadherins than type III cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that reductive changes also preceded the establishment of the type III cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In fact, the modification of cadherins by reductive changes from a larger state seems to be a common trend in the evolution of the classical cadherin structure. This directionality could possibly be associated with the cost and efficiency of the mechanical energetic processes by which classical cadherin-based adherens junctions drive morphogenesis. However, it is difficult to imagine that large deletions would instantly enhance the performance of classical cadherin molecules. Nonetheless, if such a deletion mutation did not disrupt the homophilic cell-cell binding properties of the classical cadherin but did alter its binding specificity or strategy, the affected cadherin might have had a chance to evolve independently of the parental cadherin.</p><p>Investigating the mechanism by which the classical cadherins were able to evolve via simplification is a typical challenge in experimentation-based evolutionary biology. The multistep transition from the ancestral type III cadherin to the insect type IVa cadherin offers an example with which to investigate the evolvability of type III cadherin. Genetic analysis of a DE-cadherin in which the EC7 and subsequent membrane-proximal extracellular domains had been deleted suggested that the six N-terminal-most EC domains constitute a functional unit that is capable of mediating cell-cell adhesion, whereas the membrane-proximal domains are necessary to ensure the functionality of the DE-cadherin during morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Recently, atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that the EC1-EC4 region of DE-cadherin forms a tightly folded, globular structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the deeply bent conformation of the EC region is likely to be associated with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free linker found between the EC2 and EC3 domains of type IVa cadherin, which is conserved in the corresponding EC domains (EC9 and EC10) of type III cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The EC2-EC4 region of hexapod type IVa cadherins has been demonstrated as the minimal portion capable of mediating exclusive homophilic binding specificity. Intriguingly, three consecutive EC domains of the type III DN-cadherin that correspond to the EC2-EC4 region of type IVa cadherins are able to specifically recognize the DN-cadherin as the binding partner. A series of these findings implies that type IVa cadherin might have inherited part of an as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism of homophilic binding from the type III cadherin. In this context, questions of how the two N-terminal-most ECs of type IVb cadherin contribute to the functioning of the type IVb cadherin and how the large number of EC domains in type III cadherin are utilized to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion are key to a better understanding of the stepwise reductive changes involved in the evolution of insect E-cadherin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Implications for pancrustacean phylogeny</title><p>Phylogenetic inferences of deep relationships are often problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. For example, the reconstruction methods used in the majority of modern phylogenetic analyses are based on nucleotide or amino acid substitutions in orthologous genes or proteins; however, the deep branch topologies of the resulting phylogenetic trees can be influenced by the sampling of species, choice of sequence evolution models, and variations in substitution rates among species, among sites, and even at individual sites over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Therefore, any phylogenetic hypothesis based on such analyses should be verified using alternative methods, one of which is the identification of rare genomic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we identified stable yet varied character states among the arthropod <italic>classical cadherin</italic> genes, which provided clues to the polarity of cadherin evolution. A thematically similar situation has been described among the phylum Chordata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For example, the 5-EC state of classical cadherin (type I/II cadherin) defines a clade that includes the vertebrates and urochordates, but excludes the cephalochordates, a relationship that is supported by various independent phylogenetic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In the phylum Arthropoda, the paraphyly of crustaceans has been firmly established, based on analyses of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions and rare genomic changes, and the crustaceans are now suggested to form a clade with hexapods, termed Pancrustacea, that excludes the myriapods and chelicerates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].

However, the relationships between the hexapods and other pancrustacean subgroups remain a controversial topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p>One of the major conflicts regarding the pancrustacean phylogeny concerns the relationships between hexapods, branchiopods, and malacostracans. Neural cladistics and some molecular studies propose a closer relationship between the hexapods and malacostracans than between the hexapods and branchiopods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], whereas various recent studies that have used well-sampled, large-scale sequence data support a closer relationship between the hexapods and branchiopods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], and some phylogenies even suggest that the branchiopods and malacostracans are more closely related to each other than to the hexapods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p>The complementary distributions of polarized genomic characters related to type IVa/IVb cadherins could be informative for the hexapod-branchiopod-malacostracan relationship. Based on these characters, we propose three successively nested clades, Clades 1&#x02013;3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>), in which Clade 1 includes insects but excludes collembolans, branchiopods, copepods, malacostracans, and non-pancrustacean arthropods, Clade 2 includes Clade 1, collembolans, branchiopods, and copepods but excludes malacostracans (such as isopods and amphipods) and non-pancrustacean arthropods, and Clade 3 includes Clade 2 and malacostracans but excludes non-pancrustacean myriapods and chelicerates. This topology indicates that branchiopods have a closer relationship to hexapods than malacostracans.</p><p>The matter of which crustacean subgroup is the closest relative of hexapods is also a subject of debate.

We demonstrated that the <italic>type III cadherin</italic> genes in the chelicerate <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> were representative of the ancestral genomic organization of classical cadherins in arthropods, and suggested that the precursor of insect E-cadherin originated through stepwise reductive changes after the earliest divergence of extant arthropod groups. Future studies should investigate the structural mechanisms underlying the multistep transition from the arthropod ancestral type III cadherin to the more recent insect E-cadherin. The varied, polarized, and stable character states of classical cadherins could be widely applicable as indicators of deep phylogenetic relationships, as exemplified in the arthropod and chordate phyla.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Animals</title><p>This work was performed according to the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines (JT Biohistory Research Hall).
