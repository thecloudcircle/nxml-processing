This &#x0201c;excess&#x0201d; mortality is observed across the entire country, but is greatest in and around the post-industrial conurbation of West Central Scotland. Despite systematic investigation, the causes of the excess mortality remain the subject of ongoing debate.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Attachment processes are a fundamental part of human development, and have a profound influence on adult personality and behaviour, especially in response to stressors. Many studies have also shown that childhood adversity is correlated with adult morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The interplay between childhood adversity and attachment is complex and not fully elucidated, but will include socio-economic, intergenerational and psychological factors. Importantly, some adverse health outcomes for parents (such as problem substance use or suicide) will simultaneously act as risk factors for their children.</p><p>Data show that some forms of &#x0201c;household dysfunction&#x0201d; relating to childhood adversity are more prevalent in Scotland: such problems include parental problem substance use, rates of imprisonment, rates of suicide and rates of children being taken into care. However other measures of childhood or family wellbeing have not been found to be substantially different in Scotland compared to England.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>We suggest in this paper that the role of childhood adversity and attachment experience merits further investigation as a plausible mechanism influencing health in Scotland. A model is proposed which sets out some of the interactions between the factors of interest, and we propose parameters for the types of study which would be required to evaluate the validity of the model.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Scotland</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Mortality</kwd><kwd>Health inequalities</kwd><kwd>Social determinants of health</kwd><kwd>Adverse childhood experiences</kwd><kwd>Attachment</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Scotland&#x02019;s excess mortality: alcohol, drugs, suicide and violence</title><p>Since about 1950, improvements in health in Scotland have not kept pace with those in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Between 1950 and 1980, higher mortality in Scotland compared to the rest of Europe was largely attributable to cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since about 1980, these higher death rates from physical causes have been joined by higher mortality rates from alcohol, drugs, suicide and violence, especially in Glasgow and the West Central Scotland conurbation.</p><p>These higher mortality rates relative to the rest of the UK persist even after adjustment for differences in area deprivation and individual social class, and so have been termed &#x0201c;excess&#x0201d; mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In the mid to late 2000s mortality at all ages was about 15&#x000a0;% higher in Glasgow compared to Liverpool and Manchester, similar cities in England. But premature deaths (in people less than 65&#x000a0;years old) were 30&#x000a0;% higher, and the causes of those deaths were different. Well over half of the excess premature mortality was attributable to deaths from alcohol, drugs-related poisonings, suicide and &#x0201c;external causes&#x0201d;, which includes violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Current estimates of the excess are of a 10&#x000a0;% higher all-age mortality and a 20&#x000a0;% higher premature mortality in Scotland compared to England and Wales. That excess would account for an extra 5,000 deaths per year in Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Why does West Central Scotland have high rates of problem substance use, suicide and violence, even after deprivation and other conventional aetiological factors have been controlled for? Epidemiological studies have not been able to fully explain the causes of this excess mortality. Researchers have systematically examined a range of potential explanatory factors (including inequality, the effects of migration, genetic differences, parenting style, domestic violence, family disruption, maternal mental health, sectarianism and climatic influences) and not found convincing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some authors have argued that these health and social problems reflect the impact of neoliberal economic policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] as part of a broader &#x0201c;political attack&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The most recent research has pointed to a greater vulnerability in the Scottish population caused by a series of historical processes and decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Harmful early years and childhood experiences have also been proposed as a possible explanation for the excess of poor health and mortality seen in Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This paper describes the main approaches to understanding childhood influences on adult health, proposes a model for their interaction at a population level, and reviews the issue of excess mortality in Scotland in the light of current data. The implications for future research are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conceptualising the impact of negative experiences</title><p>We have long known that childhood experiences can affect health in adulthood. There are five main concepts that currently shape our understanding of those influences.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Adverse childhood experiences</title><p>The landmark Adverse Childhood Experiences (&#x0201c;ACE&#x0201d;) studies by Felitti et al. used a retrospective epidemiological approach to ask research participants about exposure to a range of harmful or distressing experiences before the age of 18&#x000a0;years. Those experiences included domestic violence, physical or sexual abuse, emotional neglect, parental separation, alcohol and drugs misuse; and mental illness, suicide or imprisonment affecting a member of the household in which the child grew up. These experiences may be categorised and counted using a 10-item questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Two thirds of the initial ACE study population (all adult members of a Health Maintenance Organisation in the USA) reported an score of one or more, and 12.5&#x000a0;% a score of four or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Felitti et al&#x02019;s study and similar work conducted more recently in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], show a clear correlation between childhood adversity and physical and mental health problems in adulthood. A number of well-designed prospective studies have confirmed that the overall burden of childhood adversity is correlated with poor outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that exposure to four or more categories of adverse childhood experiences in the original ACE study increased the risk of adult physical illnesses such as cancer and heart disease about two-fold; but the increased risk of mental or behavioural problems was between 4- and 12-fold (after adjustment for age, gender, race, and educational attainment).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Association of childhood adversity with some adult physical health problems (shown in <italic>blue</italic>) and mental health and addiction problems (shown in <italic>red</italic>). The graph is adapted from Felitti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], &#x00026; shows odds ratios adjusted for age, gender, race, and educational attainment for adults exposed to four or more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3201_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Exposure to such childhood adversity is common: for example, 9&#x000b7;6&#x000a0;% of children in a European community survey reported sexual abuse, 22&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;% physical abuse and 29&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;% mental abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In UK studies, increasing exposure to childhood adversity has also been strongly related to adverse behavioural, mental and physical outcomes. There were no significant relationships between socio-economic (SE) deprivation and having between one and three ACEs, yet having four or more ACEs was strongly associated with higher SE deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Studies consistently show strong, graded associations between childhood adversity and the risk of adult problem drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] use, and with the development of anxiety and depression in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Childhood adversity is associated with a large increase in suicide risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is estimated that between one fifth and one third of adult mental health problems are attributable to childhood adversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and adversity seems to aggravate the functional impairment caused by such difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Exposure to childhood adversity is associated with lack of empathy, impulsivity and anger, and the emergence of behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], including delinquency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and social alienation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Each child will respond individually to their situation, and a minority of children may develop positively despite severe adversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Protective relationships with adults facilitate a child&#x02019;s response to adversity, and are critical to healthy development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Complex trauma</title><p>Complex trauma (also known as &#x0201c;complex post-traumatic stress disorder&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;type 2&#x0201d; trauma) is a term that describes psychological harm arising from repeated or prolonged trauma, including abuse or neglect during childhood. First described by Herman in the early 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the concept has a growing influence on clinical work in psychology, the addictions field and homelessness health.</p><p>Stressors leading to complex trauma are repetitive or prolonged, involve direct harm or neglect by caregivers, occur at developmentally vulnerable times, and compromise child development and adult functioning. This leads to patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving across a person&#x02019;s life course which are characterised by impulsiveness, emotional lability, difficulty functioning in relationships and symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p><p>These difficulties mean that people with complex trauma backgrounds are more likely to be involved in health harming behaviours and be exposed to ongoing risky relationships, violence and re-victimisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Complex trauma can be a practical explanatory framework for understanding the impact of childhood adversity on adult functioning and behaviour, and the use of &#x0201c;trauma informed practice&#x0201d; principles can assist in the development of public services and individual professional client relationships to better meet adults&#x02019; needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Standard interview schedules used to measure complex trauma include items ranging from &#x0201c;having someone close die unexpectedly&#x0201d;, to &#x0201c;saw atrocities/carnage&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and therefore contain a wider range of experiences than the ACE measures described above. Studies suggest that childhood trauma is highly prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], especially amongst adults who experience problem substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Criteria have been proposed for a diagnosis of complex trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but this was not included in the updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Attachment</title><p>Attachment theory was developed by the psychoanalyst John Bowlby on the basis of observations of young children&#x02019;s behaviour when separated from their parents. In order to survive, infants have to be able to form a bond with their caregiver (usually the mother), and to elicit a care-giving response from her. This &#x0201c;affectional bond&#x0201d; with a &#x0201c;differentiated and preferred individual&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] gives the child a &#x0201c;safe haven&#x0201d; to return to at times of stress, and a &#x0201c;secure base&#x0201d; from which to explore the world and gain independence.</p><p>As children interact with caregivers during infancy and childhood, they develop an &#x0201c;internal working model&#x0201d; of themselves in relation to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This model helps children to predict and understand others&#x02019; responses, to make sense of the emotions associated with interpersonal experiences, and is therefore a fundamental aspect of personality development as the child grows up.</p><p>Bowlby&#x02019;s ideas about child development have been endorsed and extended by decades of empirical evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>When carers are sensitive and responsive to a child&#x02019;s needs, a secure attachment style develops. Children who are securely attached tend to have a positive self-image, a capacity to manage distress, and the ability both to function independently and also to interact with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This is the case for the majority of children.</p><p>By contrast, insecurely-attached individuals tend to respond to stress with anxious features, including exaggerated emotional responses; or with avoidant characteristics, including suppressing negative feelings and withdrawal from help-seeking contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>These attachment patterns have a profound impact, not only on childhood development but also on adolescent and adult personality and relationships, including romantic relationships and choice of partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Attachment style may have a strong influence on children&#x02019;s ability to learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Securely-attached parents tend to raise securely attached children; similarly, parents with a fearful, avoidant or disorganised attachment experience tend to raise children with a similar attachment style [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The mechanisms for such inter-generational effects are complex, but probably mediated in part by the quality of family relationships and parental psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>The problems associated with dysfunctional attachment experiences are most evident when security is threatened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

Adults with an attachment style that enables trusting and emotionally supportive relationships may be less vulnerable to depression and physical illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Allostatic load</title><p>Human stress responses are mediated by hormones which are essential for adaptation, metabolic stability, and survival. But longer-term exposure to fluctuating or heightened stress incurs a physiological cost, which has been termed &#x0201c;allostatic load&#x0201d;. It has been demonstrated that this load can accelerate disease processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and may lead to harmful physical, behavioural and cognitive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] which begin in the prenatal period and may continue through the life span. Children exposed to adversity show markers of immune and metabolic change consistent with the abnormal functioning of these stress-sensitive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Such changes may be sensitive to developmental stage, and are modified by experiences of care-giving from adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Parental exposure to trauma during childhood is related to deficits in social-emotional development in their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Lower socio-economic status is associated with increased allostatic load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Toxic stress</title><p>The concept of &#x0201c;toxic stress&#x0201d; seeks to synthesise the evidence from work on allostatic load, adverse childhood experiences and attachment theory. It arises from the strong, frequent, or prolonged activation of the body&#x02019;s stress response systems in the absence of the buffering protection of a supportive, adult relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

This &#x0201c;excess&#x0201d; mortality is observed across the whole country, but is greatest in and around the post-industrial conurbation of West Central Scotland. Its causes remain the subject of discussion and debate, despite systematic investigation.</p><p>Nonetheless, there is now strong evidence to show that childhood experience of both adversity and attachment exert a significant influence on adult morbidity and mortality. Each of these factors is therefore a plausible influence on the excess mortality observed in Scotland.</p><p>We describe in this paper a possible model through which socio-economic factors might influence childhood experiences in a way that not only leads to harm in adulthood, but simultaneously exposes the next generation to similar risks. In this model, childhood adversity leads to damaging metabolic, immune, behavioural and developmental changes, which can be offset or mitigated to some extent by secure attachment experiences.</p><p>Inter-generational effects suggested by the model may serve to perpetuate and entrench poorer health in some population groups, especially when those groups are exposed to ongoing adversity.</p><p>Thinking about Scotland&#x02019;s health problems from this perspective links social, environmental and political factors to the health of individuals and groups. Since income, wealth, power, environment and access to services all have the potential to affect childhood adversity and attachment processes, this approach is consistent with a &#x0201c;structural&#x0201d; perspective on health inequalities, which holds that differences in the socioeconomic circumstances, at all stages of the life-course, cause differences in health outcomes&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p><p>We present data from a number of sources with which to examine this model. The critical aspect of the hypothesis is that there might be &#x0201c;something different&#x0201d; about childhood experiences in Scotland, and especially West Central Scotland, compared to other areas. Unfortunately, existing data are conflicting. In general, routinely-collected data that signal higher exposure to adversity - such as domestic violence, problem substance use, rates of imprisonment and rates of children being taken into care - indicate an excess of childhood adversity in Scotland. However measures requiring self-report about current or historic aspects of social and family functioning (eg parents reading to the child) tend not to show significant differences.</p><p>Existing datasets were not designed to answer these questions, and are subject to a number of difficulties: the samples may not be optimal, the questions asked of participants may not be appropriate, and comparisons across countries and over decades are subject to recall and cultural biases.</p><p>The model presented here emphasises the methodological complexities of conducting a study capable of exploring this hypothesis. We hope that this developmental perspective on those challenges will support future work in this important area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACEs, adverse childhood experiences; DSM-5, diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Appendix 1 Measures of childhood adversity in the 1958 National Child Development Study</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Child in care: child has ever been in public/voluntary care services or foster care at age 7, 11 or 16.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Physical neglect: child appears undernourished/dirty aged 7 or 11, based on information collected by response to teacher to the Bristol Social Adjustment Guide.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Offenders: child lived in a household where a family member was in prison or probation (aged 11&#x000a0;years) or is in contact with probation service at 7 or 11; the child has ever been to prison or been on probation at 16&#x000a0;years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Parental separation: The child has been separated from their father or mother due to death, divorce or separation at 7,11 or 16&#x000a0;years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mental illness: Household has contact with mental health services at ages 7 or 11, family member has mental illnesses at 7 or 11&#x000a0;years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alcohol abuse: Family member has alcohol abuse problem at 7&#x000a0;years (based on the health visitor&#x02019;s assessment, without questioning the family).</p></list-item></list></p><p>For each positive response to the six categories, the cohort member accumulated one adversity (up to a maximum of six).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Appendix 2: measures of childhood experience from Taulbut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]</title><p>Information collected included the following: social class of father, low birth weight, mother&#x02019;s education (or in school after minimum leaving age in the 1958 study), housing tenure, age of mother at birth of child, smoking during pregnancy (after 4&#x000a0;months pregnant in 1958 study), ever breastfed, maternal mental health (1970 study only), Dad helps mum put child to bed (1970 study only), who read to child in last week (frequency mum/dad read to child in 1958 study), Rutter scores, respiratory problems and vocabulary problems.</p></sec></app></app-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Martin Taulbut of NHS Health Scotland for completing some additional analyses of the analyses of data in the 1958 National Child Development Study cited in section 2.4.2.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This paper was unfunded.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>This paper was a joint collaboration.
