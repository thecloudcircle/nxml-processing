Here we show that TCF-1 is a critical factor to repress IL-17 gene locus by chromatin modifications during T cell development. Deletion of TCF-1 resulted in increased IL-17 gene expression both in thymus and peripheral T cells, which led to enhanced Th17 differentiation. As a result, <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were susceptible to Th17-dependent EAE induction. <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice reconstituted with <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells were also susceptible to EAE, indicating TCF-1 is intrinsically required to repress IL-17. However, expression of wild-type TCF-1 or dominant negative TCF-1 did not interfere with Th17 differentiation in mature T cells. Furthermore, expression of TCF-1 in <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells could not restore Th17 differentiation to wild-type levels, indicating that TCF-1 cannot affect IL-17 production at the mature T cell stage. This is also supported by the normal up-regulation or activation in mature <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells of factors known to regulate Th17 differentiation, including ROR&#x003b3;t and Stat3. We observed hyperacetylation together with trimethylation of Lys-4 at the IL-17 locus in <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> thymocytes, two epigenetic modifications indicating an open active state of the gene. Such epigenetic modifications were preserved even when <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells migrated out of thymus. Therefore, TCF-1 mediates an active process to repress IL-17 gene expression via epigenetic modifications during T cell development. This TCF-1-mediated repression of IL-17 is critical for peripheral T cells to generate balanced immune responses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In response to antigen stimulation, na&#x000ef;ve T cells have the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages of T helpers such as Th1, Th2, Th17 and regulatory T cells (Treg). Because the different T helpers perform distinct, sometimes even opposite, functions <xref rid="pone.0024768-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, balanced differentiation to different T helpers is critical for maintaining properly immune responses. Inappropriately enhanced or reduced potential for forming specific types of T helpers leads to either autoimmunity or immunodeficiency. Many studies have focused on how the cytokine environment regulates T cell differentiation into different types of T helpers; however, little is known about whether and how the developmental process programs T cells to generate balanced immune responses once they migrate out to periphery. Positive and negative selection during development of T cells in the thymus ensures that mature T cells are responsive only to foreign but not self-antigens <xref rid="pone.0024768-Hogquist1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Another function of T cell development in the thymus is to program T cells such that they have unbiased potential to form different lineages of T helpers, as biased potential to form a specific type of T helper leads to unbalanced immune responses.</p><p>Identification of the Th17 lineage has changed the traditional Th1/Th2 paradigm by adding a new lineage of T helpers <xref rid="pone.0024768-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In 2003, <italic>Cua et al</italic>. made the seminal observation that IL-23, but not the Th1 cytokine IL-12, was critical for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which had long been believed to be a Th1-dependent autoimmune disease <xref rid="pone.0024768-Cua1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. IL-23 was required for the expansion of IL-17-producing pathogenic T cells, which induced EAE when adoptively transferred to na&#x000ef;ve mice <xref rid="pone.0024768-Langrish1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 cytokines <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ouyang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and IL-17 induces massive tissue inflammation due to broad distribution of its receptors on both immune and nonimmune cells <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ouyang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition to EAE, Th17 has also been identified as the pathogenic T cell in an animal model of collagen-induced arthritis <xref rid="pone.0024768-Lubberts1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <xref rid="pone.0024768-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Circumstantial evidence has also accumulated suggesting the pathologenic role of Th17 cells in multiple human autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis <xref rid="pone.0024768-Matusevicius1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0024768-Kirkham1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, asthma <xref rid="pone.0024768-Molet1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, IBD <xref rid="pone.0024768-Duerr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and psoriasis <xref rid="pone.0024768-Krueger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for regulating the differentiation of Th17 will therefore facilitate the development of treatments that target Th17-mediated autoimmunity <xref rid="pone.0024768-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Stimulation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the presence of TGF&#x003b2; and IL-6 is sufficient to form IL-17-producing T cells <xref rid="pone.0024768-Harrington1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and IL-6 activates Stat3, which is essential for formation of Th17 cells <xref rid="pone.0024768-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, IL-6 and TGF&#x003b2; together are required to induce ROR&#x003b3;t, a master regulator of Th17. T cells deficient in ROR&#x003b3;t fail to become IL-17 producing cells, even in the presence of TGF&#x003b2; and IL-6 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ivanov1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. So far, almost all the factors known to interfere with Th17 differentiation do so by direct or indirect regulation of ROR&#x003b3;t expression <xref rid="pone.0024768-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Peripheral T cells in <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice can form Th17 cells once ROR&#x003b3;t is provided <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ivanov1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, suggesting that ROR&#x003b3;t is not required for the thymic development of T cells with the potential to form Th17 cells. However, it is still unclear whether the potential of Th17 formation is regulated during T cell development in thymus.</p><p>T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) is a transcription factor that is enriched in hematopoietic cells and plays an important role in T cell development in the thymus <xref rid="pone.0024768-Schilham1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Okamura1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ioannidis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Xie2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Staal1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> as well as T cell differentiation in the periphery <xref rid="pone.0024768-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. TCF-1 plays an important role in the CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> double negative to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double positive transition stage <xref rid="pone.0024768-Schilham1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and in regulating double positive thymocyte survival <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ioannidis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition to its function in T cell development, TCF-1 also regulates T cell differentiation. Although T cell activation seems normal in the absence of TCF-1 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Schilham1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells exhibit defects in differentiation to Th2 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. TCF-1 promotes Th2 through direct transcriptional activation of GATA-3, a master gene for Th2 differentiation, but likely does not act by affecting Th2 differentiation potential during thymic development, as such an effect can be observed by forced expression of dominant negative TCF-1 in wild-type (WT) mature T cells <xref rid="pone.0024768-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Further support for this idea comes from the observation that &#x003b2;-catenin, the TCF-1 co-activator, enhanced TCF-1-mediated stimulation of Th2 differentiation when expressed in WT mature T cells. Therefore, the question still remains whether TCF-1-mediated function in thymus eventually affects T cell function once the cells migrate into the periphery.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that TCF-1 is required to epigenetically maintain the IL-17 gene locus in a repressive state. Deletion of TCF-1 opens the IL-17 locus during T cell development, resulting in a high potential for differentiation of T cells into Th17 cells. Enhanced Th17 formation by deletion of TCF-1 was also demonstrated by increased susceptibility of <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to EAE induction. Furthermore, susceptibility to EAE was also observed when <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells were adoptively transferred into <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, indicating that TCF-1 is intrinsically required to repress IL-17 production. However, forced expression of WT TCF-1 or dominant negative TCF in mature T cells could not interfere with IL-17 expression, suggesting that TCF-1 modulates the IL-17 locus only during the development stage. Once T cells are mature, TCF-1 can no longer affect IL-17 expression. This idea is further enhanced by our finding that forced expression of TCF-1 in <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mature T cells did not change the phenotype of enhanced IL-17 production. Therefore, our results demonstrate that TCF-1 regulates the developmental program to repress the IL-17 locus, resulting in modulation of the potential for Th17 formation of mature T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and experiments were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope (IACUC#07023).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mice</title><p>

We thus examined histone H3 acetylation (H3-Acetyl) and methylation at Lys-4 (H3-K4M3), both chromatin modifications contributing to open up the gene locus for active transcription <xref rid="pone.0024768-Pokholok1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

Critical cytokine loci, such as IFN&#x003b3; (Th1), IL-4 (Th2) and IL-17 (Th17), are repressed in na&#x000ef;ve T cells until the engagement of antigens that initiate differentiation. Previous studies have demonstrated the IFN&#x003b3; and IL-4 gene loci undergo dramatic epigenetic changes in chromatin modification, resulting in activation of their expression upon differentiation to Th1 and Th2 respectively <xref rid="pone.0024768-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Similarly, during Th17 differentiation, the IL-17 locus also undergoes extensive chromatin modification, leading to a significant increase in chromatin accessibility for transcription activation <xref rid="pone.0024768-Akimzhanov1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Peripheral mature T cells are thus capable of converting inactive cytokine gene loci to active. Such a capability requires that the cytokine gene loci be programmed into a reversible repressive state during T cell development so that they can be de-repressed and further activated once T cells migrate out of the thymus. However, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for programming cytokine gene loci during T cell development. In this study, we demonstrated that TCF-1 is a critical factor required to repress IL-17 gene locus in thymus. Compared to WT mice, mice lacking TCF-1 had increased IL-17 gene expression both in thymic and peripheral T cells, which was confirmed by a larger natural Th17 cell population in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g001">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). Furthermore, when stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic>, even in the absence of TCF&#x003b2; and IL-6, cytokines critical for Th17 formation, <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells formed Th17 cells, suggesting an elevated potential for Th17 formation in the absence of TCF-1. Indeed, <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells formed twice as many Th17 cells than did WT cells in the presence of TGF&#x003b2; and IL-6. Lastly, <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice adoptively transferred with <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells were more susceptible to induction of EAE, a Th17-dependent autoimmune disease. Taken together, our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments support that TCF-1 is intrinsically required to suppress Th17 differentiation. Consistent with our results, a recent study also demonstrated negative role of TCF-1 in Th17 differentiation <xref rid="pone.0024768-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, it was suggested that TCF-1 likely regulate IL-17 at mature stage. In contrast, our results support that TCF-1 modifies IL-17 gene locus during T cell development in thymus, and such modifications are imprinted in cells even after T cells mature and migrate out of thymus. Our data do not exclude other alternative explanation. Since TCF family has multiple members including TCF-3, TCF-4 as well as LEF-1, we do not exclude the possibility that T cells at mature stages use different members of TCF to regulate Th17, which could explain why TCF-1 does not affect Th17 differentiation at mature stage. However, dnTCF, which also interferes other TCF function, did not affect Th17 differentiation in mature stage, favoring that TCF-1 regulates IL-17 locus in immature stage. In addition, we would like to mention that only mice were used in this study. The mechanisms revealed in this study may not apply to human T cells, as human T cells are not as stringent in terms of lineage commitment in comparison to mouse T cells.</p><p>Although many transcription factors have been identified as either positively or negatively regulating Th17 differentiation, including ROR&#x003b3;t <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ivanov1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, Stat3 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, Runx1<xref rid="pone.0024768-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, IRF4 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, Ahr <xref rid="pone.0024768-Veldhoen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, Batf <xref rid="pone.0024768-Schraml1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, Foxp3 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Zhou2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and Ets-1 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Akimzhanov1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ivanov2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Moisan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, TCF-1 is unique because it regulates Th17 differentiation without affecting ROR&#x003b3;t (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g004">Fig. 4A&#x02013;B</xref>), whereas other transcription factors promote or inhibit Th17 differentiation by regulating the levels of ROR&#x003b3;t. Furthermore, deletion of TCF-1 does not alter expression of the above listed factors known to regulate Th17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). In addition, TCF-1 does not affect Th17 differentiation in mature peripheral T cells. We showed that overexpression of WT TCF-1, dnTCF or the TCF-1 coactivator &#x003b2;-catenin did not interfere with Th17 differentiation, which was not due to overexpression of TCF-1, as restoration of TCF-1 expression in mature <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells also failed to interfere with Th17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g005">Fig. 5B&#x02013;C</xref>). In contrast, restoring expression of factors that affect Th17 differentiation in their corresponding knockout T cells usually restores IL-17 production <xref rid="pone.0024768-Ivanov1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Moisan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. These results exclude the possibility that TCF-1 regulates Th17 differentiation potential in mature T cells, which raises the question of when and where TCF-1 determines Th17 differentiation potential.</p><p>Many previous studies focused on how the cytokine environment determines the differentiation of mature T cells to specific lineages of T helpers. However, T cell function is also shaped during development in the thymus. The best example is the positive and negative selection process in thymus to ensure the specificity of T cell response to only foreign antigens <xref rid="pone.0024768-Goldrath1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Once T cells are mature and migrate out of thymus, the specificity of T cell response to antigens cannot be changed. Little is known about whether and how T cell development in thymus affects the potential of mature T cells to differentiate into a specific lineage of T helpers. Our study supports the idea that TCF-1 determines the Th17 differentiation potential during T cell development in the thymus, but not in the periphery after maturation of T cells, and thus indicates that the T cell development process can also shape the potential of mature T helper cell differentiation, which is critical for generating balanced immune responses and avoiding autoimmunity.</p><p>T cell development is a complicated process that depends on reprogramming chromatin structure to activate and repress a network of genes critical for specification and function of T cells. Acetylation and methylation are two critical epigenetic modifications of DNA for regulating gene expression by changing the accessibility of the chromatin <xref rid="pone.0024768-Pokholok1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Chromatin remodeling of the IL-17 locus has been detected during Th17 differentiation <xref rid="pone.0024768-Akimzhanov1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and in na&#x000ef;ve T cells this locus is hypoacetylated (H3-Acetyl) and hypomethylated at Lys-4 of histone 3 (H3-K4M3), indicating a closed state. During Th17 differentiation, the IL-17 locus is slowly transformed into an open state indicated by hyper-H3-Acetyl and hyper-H3-K4M3. Our results demonstrate that the IL-17 locus in <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> thymocytes is more acetylated (H3-Acetyl) and slightly higher methylated (H3-K4M3) than in WT cells, suggesting an abnormal open state of the IL-17 locus, which would explain the increased levels of IL-17 mRNA and natural Th17 observed in <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, our results suggest there is a TCF-1-mediated active process to repress the IL-17 locus by epigenetic modifications during T cell development in thymus. The presence of increased IL-17 mRNA levels and natural Th17 in both thymic and peripheral T cells of <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice further suggests that TCF-1-mediated epigenetic modifications of IL-17 locus, once finished in the thymus, can be preserved even after T cells migrate out of the thymus to the periphery. This explains our observation that peripheral <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells have high potential to form Th17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), although TCF-1 could not affect Th17 differentiation in mature T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). TCF-1-mediated epigenetic modification of IL-17 locus is likely a key mechanism for preventing T cells from generating overwhelming inflammatory IL-17, which has been associated with numerous autoimmune diseases <xref rid="pone.0024768-Bettelli1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This notion is supported by the fact that <italic>TCF-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are extremely susceptible to EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Much remains unknown concerning detailed molecular mechanisms responsible for TCF-1-regulated IL-17 expression. &#x003b2;-catenin has been reported to activate target gene expression together with TCF-1 <xref rid="pone.0024768-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024768-Huang3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, our results do not support the idea that &#x003b2;-catenin as an activator of TCF-1 is involved in this process, as a stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin transgene that is expressed in the thymus did not affect IL-17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024768-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). TCF-1 inhibits target gene expression when it associates with the co-repressor GRG in mouse (Groucho in Drosophila) <xref rid="pone.0024768-Roose1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, it has not yet been determined whether GRG is required for TCF-1 to inhibit the IL-17 locus. It is possible that TCF-1 does not directly inhibit IL-17 gene but via another factor. For example, TCF-1 may activate an IL-17 inhibitor or inhibit an IL-17 activator or both. We have demonstrated that TCF-1 is a critical factor required to inhibit IL-17 gene expression through epigenetic modifications in the thymus, which is a critical mechanism for generating appropriate Th17 responses. Disruption of this mechanism likely leads to overt Th17 inflammation that contributes to autoimmunity. TCF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway plays a role in multiple types of immune cells including dendritic cells. For example, &#x003b2;-catenin has been shown to regulate Treg vs. inflammatory T cell balance via dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0024768-Vang1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Therefore, TCF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin regulates multiple functions and multiple types of cells in immune system. More studies on how different immune cells integrate TCF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin signals to coordinate immune responses are essential to understanding the function of this important pathway in immune system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Dong Chen of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for helping with retrovirus-mediated transduction of T cells and Th17 differentiation experiments; Dr. Defu Zeng of the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope for providing <italic>Rag1</italic>
