Both podoplanin and CLEC-2 are required for normal lymphangiogenesis as mice lacking either protein develop a blood-lymphatic mixing phenotype. We investigated the roles of podoplanin and its interaction with platelets in migration and tube formation by LEC. Addition of platelets or antibody-mediated crosslinking of podoplanin inhibited LEC migration induced by vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A or VEGF-C), but did not modify basal migration or the response to basic fibroblast growth factor or epidermal growth factor. In addition, platelets and podoplanin crosslinking disrupted networks of LEC formed in co-culture with fibroblasts. Depletion of podoplanin in LEC using siRNA negated the pro-migratory effect of VEGF-A and VEGF-C. Inhibition of RhoA or Rho-kinase reduced LEC migration induced by VEGF-C, but had no further effect after crosslinking of podoplanin, suggesting that podoplanin is required for signaling downstream of VEGF-receptors but upstream of RhoA. Together, these data reveal for the first time that podoplanin is an intrinsic specific regulator of VEGF-mediated migration and network formation in LEC and identify crosslinking of podoplanin by platelets or antibodies as mechanisms to modulate this pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CLEC-2</kwd><kwd>lymphangiogenesis</kwd><kwd>platelets</kwd><kwd>podoplanin</kwd><kwd>VEGF</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">British Heart Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000274</named-content></funding-source><award-id>H/03/003</award-id><award-id>PG/11/119</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Medical Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000265</named-content></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a project grant (PG/11/119) from the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and by a Medical Research Council PhD Studentship (S.A.

These lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) then migrate away from the cardinal vein in a VEGF-C dependent manner [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>] to form the primordial thoracic duct, acquiring podoplanin expression during the process. Further sprouting from these nascent structures and subsequent remodeling creates the rest of the lymphatic network.</p><p>Podoplanin is the only known ligand for the platelet receptor CLEC-2, and previous studies have shown that both are necessary for the correct development of the lymphatic vasculature [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Mutant mice lacking either of these proteins displayed a phenotype in which blood was detected in lymphatic vessels. Similarly, mice lacking signaling proteins known to be downstream of CLEC-2, including Syk, SLP-76, and PLC&#x003b3;2, displayed a blood-lymphatic mixing phenotype [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. The platelet-specific role for CLEC-2 was confirmed by the creation and studies of lymphangiogenesis in <italic>Clec1b</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>PF4-Cre mice [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. These studies also showed that platelets from mice expressing CLEC-2 inhibited the migration and formation of networks of LEC on matrigel, while platelets isolated from mice lacking expression had a significantly weaker inhibitory effect in both assays [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>].</p><p>In comparison with CLEC-2 in platelets, signaling downstream of podoplanin in LEC has not been well described. The cytoplasmic domain of podoplanin consists of only nine amino acids, but contains a sequence of three basic amino acids that are necessary for interaction with the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) protein family [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. ERM proteins connect membrane-bound proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and are involved in signaling pathways that control cell migration and adhesion [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. Overexpression of podoplanin in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells promoted migration and increased the amount of active RhoA, which was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of ERM proteins, leading the authors to conclude that podoplanin phosphorylates ERM proteins via RhoA and its effector protein, Rho kinase (ROCK) [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Conversely, it has been shown that siRNA-mediated knockdown of podoplanin in LEC reduced the ability of these cells to migrate across a wound or form networks on Matrigel [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Podoplanin knockdown was associated with a reduction in active RhoA and treating LEC with an inhibitor of RhoA was able to prevent network formation [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. However, podoplanin knockdown had no effect on the amount of phosphorylated nor basal ERM proteins in LEC [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>].</p><p>VEGF-C is a critical regulator of lymphangiogenesis whose absence results in a lack of lymphatic vessels and embryonic lethality [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. A similar phenotype was observed in mice that had a mutation encoding a tyrosine kinase inactive VEGFR3 [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. Conversely, overexpression of VEGF-C can increase lymphatic growth in adult tissues and is also thought to promote inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis in the adult [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. VEGF-C has multiple splice variants and its affinity for VEGFR3 increases with each processing step. Mature, fully processed VEGF-C is able to bind to VEGFR2 as well as VEGFR3 [<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. Soluble VEGFR3 or VEGFR3-blocking antibodies prevent the maturation of lymphatic capillaries during embryonic development and the early postnatal period, but have no effect on established vessels [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. However, administration of VEGFR2- or VEGFR3-blocking antibodies to adult mice prevents lymphangiogenesis in areas of wound healing [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. LEC express both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>] and interaction between VEGF-C and VEGFR3 [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>], or between VEGFA and VEGFR2 [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>] have both been reported to increase LEC migration.</p><p>The above suggests that podoplanin and VEGF-mediated signaling both regulate LEC migration and that both are required for mature lymphangiogenesis as well as embryonic formation of the lymphatics. However, the link between the two pathways has not been fully explored. Moreover, the role of platelets in formation of lymphatics and their ability to alter behavior of LEC suggests that crosslinking of podoplanin by CLEC-2 further regulates this axis.</p><p>To investigate further, we analyzed the effects of platelets, podoplanin crosslinking by antibodies, and podoplanin knockdown by siRNA on migration of LEC through micropore filters, and on the stable tube-like networks of LEC formed when they were co-cultured with human dermal fibroblasts. We found that antibody-mediated crosslinking of podoplanin inhibited migration and network formation by LEC in a similar manner to platelets. Reduction in expression of podoplanin independently reduced the effects of platelets and of responses to VEGFA or VEGFC on migration, but not basal migration or increases induced by other growth factors. Inhibition of RhoA or Rho-kinase also inhibited VEGF-induced migration, but crosslinking of podoplanin had no additional effects, suggesting that podoplanin was linked to RhoA downstream of VEGFR signaling. Thus, podoplanin intrinsically and specifically regulates responses to different VEGF family members, while crosslinking of podoplanin through platelets or otherwise likewise may influence the development and stability of forming lymphatic vessels.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The work described here was performed with the ethical approval of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Ethical Review Committee of the University of Birmingham.

The more puzzling observation that platelets were able to completely down-regulate VEGF-mediated migration even for HMEC-1 that expressed podoplanin at a lower and non-uniform level would seem to require that only cells expressing podoplanin above a threshold level could respond to VEGF-C.

We found for the first time that stable networks of LEC could be established on monolayers of fibroblasts. Networks of LEC formed within 72 hours, with little further growth beyond this time (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5A</xref>). With added VEGF-C, networks tended to be more stable and extensive than without (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5B</xref>). It was shown previously that fibroblasts in this co-culture assay produced VEGF and that inhibition of VEGF-R reduced tube formation even when no exogenous VEGF was added [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. This indicates that any effect of platelets or podoplanin on networks could not be studied independent of VEGF. Since VEGF is intrinsic to the assay, we added VEGF-C to obtain as standard conditions as possible under which to test the effects podoplanin ligation or crosslinking. To assess the effects of platelets on tube formation, LEC were co-cultured with HDF and VEGF-C for three days to allow networks to form and then incubated with platelets for 24 hours. The LEC became rounded and the previously detected networks disintegrated (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6A</xref>).

On the other hand, reduction in expression of podoplanin induced an equivalent suppression of the response to VEGF. These treatments inhibited responses to both VEGF-A and VEGF-C, but none affected the substantial basal migration in the absence of VEGF, nor did crosslinking inhibit increases in migration induced by bFGF or EGF. Blockade of receptors VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 indicated that these receptors primarily supported the responses to VEGF-A and VEGF-C, respectively, although response to VEGF-C appeared to utilize both receptors. Thus, podoplanin is a regulator of LEC migration specific to VEGF and is able to modulate signaling through VEGFR-2 and VEGFR3.</p><p>Platelets were also able to suppress migration of HMEC-1, an immortalized endothelial cell line derived from dermal tissue which express podoplanin, albeit at a lower level than LEC. Interestingly, the pro-migratory effect of VEGF-C was less for these cells than LEC, but platelets returned migration of both to baseline level. Both cell types had significant basal migration without VEGF, and for LEC at least, this was not dependent on podoplanin expression or crosslinking. It seems, however, that the addition of VEGF increased transmigration by a degree depending on the level of podoplanin expressed or the proportion of cells expressing podoplanin. Subsequently, if the responding cells expressing adequate podoplanin became non-responders when podoplanin was ligated, the overall population migration would return to the level without VEGF-C for either LEC or HMEC-1. Put the other way, the trends suggest that only those cells expressing podoplanin above a certain level would respond to VEGF and have that response modified by ligation of podoplanin. These trends thus further support the key role of podoplanin in regulating the response to VEGF-C.</p><p>We developed a &#x0201c;lymphatic network&#x0201d; formation assay, based on the co-culture of LEC and HDF. This model was based on one previously used with vascular endothelial cells (VEC) in the study of angiogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>], and we report the first description of formation of comparable stable networks for LEC. Addition of platelets to these networks or crosslinking of podoplanin caused their disruption. Thus, overall, crosslinking of podoplanin mimicked responses to platelets closely, and indeed, the effect of platelets on migration was lost after reduction in expression of podoplanin by siRNA. Migration of LEC was also suppressed when murine platelets were added, but the effect was significantly reduced when the platelets were derived from mice lacking expression of CLEC-2. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the effects of platelets were mediated through crosslinking of podoplanin by CLEC-2, which has previously been shown to be able to fulfill that function [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>].</p><p>Downstream of VEGFR, inhibition of RhoA, or of ROCK nullified migratory responses to VEGF-C. Interestingly, crosslinking of podoplanin had no further effect when combined with these inhibitors. Rho GTPases are well-described regulators of cell motility [<xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>], and these results indicate that podoplanin regulated signaling through RhoA.</p><p>Our findings are broadly consistent with previous observations on behavior of LEC. We recently reported that platelets or crosslinking of podoplanin inhibited LEC migration in presence of VEGFC and short-term formation of networks on Matrigel [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. Osada et al., found similar effects of platelets on these responses and showed that soluble agents released by platelets activated through GpVI ligation could also inhibit migration and network formation on Matrigel [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. The relevance of the effects of substances released through GpVI ligation to the effects of podoplanin-CLEC-2 interaction is uncertain. In our studies, crosslinking of podoplanin on LEC (where there would be no substances from platelets) was similarly effective to platelets themselves, ruling out an absolute requirement for released agents in effects described. Others noted that knockdown of podoplanin in LEC reduced their ability to migrate across a wound or form networks on Matrigel [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. In MDCK cells, overexpression of podoplanin increased active RhoA and phosphorylated ERM proteins [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>], while in LEC, podoplanin knockdown was associated with a reduction in active RhoA but had no effect on the amount of phosphorylated ERM proteins [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>] We did not find any change in phosphorylated ERM proteins after podoplanin knockdown, while crosslinking podoplanin did not inhibit the increase in active RhoA detected within 10 minutes or 10 hours after treatment with VEGFC (data not shown). Others have suggested that the action of podoplanin on ERM-phosphorylation operates via active RhoA [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>], which would be consistent with the action of RhoA requiring podoplanin. Thus, two possibilities arise, in that podoplanin might be required for the activation of RhoA itself or may regulate RhoA function downstream of VEGF-R.</p><p>The observation that both loss of expression of podoplanin and crosslinking of endogenous podoplanin had similar effects on VEGF-induced migration suggests a requirement for signaling through podoplanin downstream of VEGF-R that would be turned off by podoplanin ligation. Interestingly, podoplanin crosslinking or knockdown solely abrogated VEGF-mediated migration, whereas responses to other growth factors remained unaffected. This could be explained if VEGFR signaling to RhoA required input from podoplanin, but signaling from the other growth factors to RhoA was via another route. It is also interesting that podoplanin is required in LEC to respond to VEGF-A or VEGF-C, while VEC which do not express podoplanin respond to VEGF-A at least. This difference may arise from the different combinations of VEGFR used by these cells (e.g., VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in VEC vs. VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 in LEC) or from intrinsic differences in pathways downstream of the receptors in the different cells [<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>].</p><p>It is notable that we could not achieve better than ~50% reduction in surface expression of podoplanin using various combinations and concentrations of siRNA. However, this result is consistent with the level in other reports judging by the unquantified Western blots presented [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, this reduction in expression was sufficient to negate the effect of VEGF on migration. That 50% of podoplanin remained after 72 hour treatment with siRNA implies that there is a long-lived portion of the constitutive podoplanin. A possible explanation for the migration results is that there are &#x0201c;fast&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; turnover pools of podoplanin that have different functional effects, or that the function of podoplanin changes with time after expression. Thus, the long-lived pool of podoplanin may not be linked to the signaling machinery for migration. However, the more newly expressed pool or fast-turnover pool (not expressed after treatment with siRNA) may be a key for the regulation of the VEGF response.</p><p>It is also notable that the network formation assay used here, based on the co-culture of LEC and HDF, is different from LEC networks formed on Matrigel. In the Matrigel assay, networks form on a surface of deposited growth factors and the networks typically only persist for a few hours [<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>]. In contrast, networks formed in co-cultures developed and persisted over four days. There is also evidence that for VEC at least, the networks have lumens, making this model more representative of endothelial tube formation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. These stable networks were clearly susceptible to the effects of platelets and podoplanin crosslinking. The transfilter assay used for the majority of the studies showed quite high levels of basal cell migration, which were relatively insensitive to treatments other than VEGF. However, the assay was robust in that we consistently observed significant effects of VEGF and modifiers of its response. Overall, in 23 experiments, the proportional increase from baseline with VEGF-C was 51 &#x000b1; 8% (mean &#x000b1; SEM). The finding that the basal migration was itself consistently unaffected by platelets or podoplanin crosslinking was a key in being able to show that these specifically affected the response to VEGF-C.</p><p>A number of observations indicate the physiological significance of the interactions analyzed here. Lack of podoplanin or platelet-specific loss of CLEC-2 causes malformation of the lymphatics during development in utero, where platelet-LEC interactions can be seen in the cardinal vein during the process of the separation of the lymphatic system [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. In adult mice, radiation chimaeras reconstituted with CLEC-2-deficient bone marrow exhibit blood-lymphatic mixing in the intestines, illustrating a role for platelets in continuing repair and growth of the lymphatic system [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. Interactions between platelets and LEC can also be observed near the junction of the thoracic duct and subclavian vein in mice, where they appear to prevent leakage of blood into the lymph [<xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>]. Here, LEC migration was reduced when 10<sup>7</sup> platelets (equivalent to the content of about 50&#x000b5;l of blood) were added to 3x10<sup>4</sup> endothelial cells coating a surface area of 30mm<sup>2</sup>. In the assay, not all the platelets are likely to have actually adhered and made effective contact, while in vivo, there is likely to be a degree of flow, so that platelets are continually delivered, making many contacts possible. In flowing blood, we have shown that platelets are effectively marginated to the periphery close to endothelium [<xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref>] and that high levels of deposition of platelets occur when blood is flowed over LEC at low shear rates [<xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>]. Thus, we believe that the conditions applied, although rather remote from those in vivo, are a relevant representation of interactions that could happen there, and that the changes in motility noted are relevant to the development, growth, and repair of lymphatics, which will include a component of LEC migration.</p><p>In conclusion, podoplanin which is highly expressed in LEC is an essential regulator of the response to VEGF in these cells, but not intrinsic motility or that stimulated by other growth factors. Platelets are thus able to modulate the migration of lymphatic endothelial cells and their ability to maintain stable networks by crosslinking this ligand which in turn modulates signaling through the RhoA pathway downstream of VEGFR-2 or -3. Our results suggest that podoplanin ligation can represent a novel approach to modulate LEC migration and tube formation in response to VEGF isoforms, key processes during cancer- and inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. Further studies are warranted to dissect the potential therapeutic value of such an approach.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr Victoria Heath of the University of Birmingham for assistance with setting up the co-culture model of lymphangiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="S0006"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by a project grant (PG/11/119) from the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and by a Medical Research Council PhD Studentship (S.A.
