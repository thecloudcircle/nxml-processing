Previously, there has not been a practical way to apply MH to a wound site, which renders treatment for an extended period extremely difficult. Tissue-engineered scaffolds offer an alternative treatment method to standard dressings by providing varying geometries to best treat the specific tissue. MH was incorporated into cryogels, hydrogels, and electrospun scaffolds to assess the effect of scaffold geometry on bacterial clearance and adhesion, as well as cellular adhesion. Electrospun scaffolds exhibited a faster release due to the nanoporous fibrous geometry which led to a larger partial bacterial clearance as compared to the more three-dimensional cryogels (CG) and hydrogels (HG). Similarly, the fast release of MH from the electrospun scaffolds resulted in reduced bacterial adhesion. Overall, the fast MH release of the electrospun scaffolds versus the extended release of the HG and CG scaffolds provides differences in cellular/bacterial adhesion and advantages for both short and long-term applications, respectively. This manuscript provides a comparison of the scaffold pore structures as well as bacterial and cellular properties, providing information regarding the relationship between varying scaffold geometry and MH efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Manuka honey</kwd><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>scaffolds</kwd><kwd>electrospun scaffolds</kwd><kwd>hydrogels</kwd><kwd>cryogels</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-gels-05-00021"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Honey has been recognized for centuries for its medicinal and healing properties [<xref rid="B1-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Specifically, Manuka honey (MH) has recently become a popular choice due to its unique Manuka factor (UMF) and as a result, its advantageous antimicrobial effects [<xref rid="B4-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similar to other honeys, MH has a high sugar content leading to a high osmolality. This sugar alone has been shown to result in antibacterial properties in 61% of honeys [<xref rid="B6-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Derived from nectar of the <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic> found in New Zealand, MH additionally possesses a low pH ranging from 3.5&#x02013;4.5. This leads to increased angiogenesis and the stimulation of macrophages [<xref rid="B4-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While the hydrogen peroxide released from honey is antibacterial, the key factor in MH that leads to these specific results is the unique Manuka factor (UMF) which provides methylglyoxal (MGO) at the wound site [<xref rid="B6-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Clinically, MH has been shown to successfully treat various bacterium including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>), <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) [<xref rid="B2-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite MH&#x02019;s blossoming popularity in clinical applications, current use requires a dressing which lacks permanence and results in frequent treatments [<xref rid="B12-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In response to this, dressings impregnated with honey have become popular with positive outcomes [<xref rid="B13-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, novel tissue engineering scaffolds offer a unique avenue for honey delivery while also providing a matrix for guided tissue regeneration [<xref rid="B4-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B16-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Electrospun scaffolds, hydrogels, and cryogels, three very different scaffold types, are appropriate for varying tissue engineering applications due to their difference in structure. Specifically, electrospun scaffolds have commonly been used for skin-related wound healing applications (i.e., burns, pressure ulcers, etc.) due to their flat geometry [<xref rid="B17-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, these scaffolds have exhibited challenges regarding cellular infiltration and mechanical integrity for load-bearing applications [<xref rid="B18-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hydrogels scaffolds have commonly been used for muscle and bone as well as drug and cell-encapsulation; however, these popular scaffolds have inadequate pore sizes for angiogenesis and reduced mechanical stability [<xref rid="B17-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B19-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cryogel scaffolds have commonly been used for bone and cartilage applications, but are not mechanically strong and exhibit reduced cellular infiltration due to the thickness of the scaffold [<xref rid="B19-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that MH can be incorporated into and released from electrospun scaffolds, hydrogels, and cryogels.</p><p>In a study by Minden-Birkenmaier et al [<xref rid="B21-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], electrospun 15 wt% poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone) incorporated with 1, 5, 10, and 20% v/v MH resulted in increased osmotic pressure. Additionally, increased fibroblast proliferation and migration along with bacterial clearance of both <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> was demonstrated. Another study similarly electrospun various concentrations of MH, but with the polymer silk fibroin [<xref rid="B22-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. When implanted over a 9 mm wound in BALB/c mice, the wound size was significantly decreased over 12 days due to the presence of the honey. Similarly, silk fibroin has also been incorporated with 5% (v/v) MH to assess the release kinetics and bacterial clearance as affected by differing the UMF [<xref rid="B23-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. MH has also been electrospun with poly(vinyl alcohol) and likewise exhibited clearance of both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as well as an extended release of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone [<xref rid="B24-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In comparison, hydrogels are hydrophilic, nanoporous gel structures formed through the crosslinking of gel precursors. The resulting three-dimensional (3D) structure can be used for various applications including cell-encapsulation, drug delivery, food additives, wound dressings, and tissue engineering [<xref rid="B26-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Multiple studies have examined the addition of MH to hydrogel scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications including wound healing and cartilage repair [<xref rid="B1-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B28-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. El-Malek et al [<xref rid="B31-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] incorporated 20% (v/v) MH into a chitosan-gelatin hydrogel, resulting in antibacterial properties to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>. Similarly, two studies completed by Bonifacio et al [<xref rid="B32-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] examined a MH/gellan gum composite hydrogel which led to the inhibition of both <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> clinical isolates. As this was targeting cartilage repair, mesenchymal stem cells were also seeded on the scaffolds and, in addition to no cytotoxic effect, collagen II expression and synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans was observed. The mechanical properties of sodium alginate-based hydrogel films with MH have also been evaluated where the Young&#x02019;s Modulus was shown to increase with the addition of MH [<xref rid="B34-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Similar to hydrogels, cryogels are formed through the crosslinking of a polymer solution. However, following crosslinking, the solution is immediately frozen such that the solvent crystalizes, acting as a porogen. Upon thawing the scaffold, and subsequent melting of the porogen, the resulting structure appears sponge-like and macroporous [<xref rid="B19-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B35-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Such a scaffold can be used for cell separation, chromatography, bioreactors, and tissue engineering techniques [<xref rid="B19-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B36-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Three studies conducted in our lab have incorporated MH into cryogel scaffolds. Silk fibroin has been combined with MH at 1, 5, and 10% (w/v and v/v) and resulted in decreased pore size in comparison to plain silk fibroin cryogels [<xref rid="B37-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite this, MG-63 cells were able to fully infiltrate over 28 days in both studies. Additionally, gelatin cryogels incorporated with MH were also compared where none of scaffolds displayed crack propagation under mechanical loading and led to clearance of both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> after 24 h [<xref rid="B38-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Lastly, a study by Hixon et al [<xref rid="B23-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] compared various UMF in 5% (v/v) MH silk fibroin cryogels, concluding that due to the extended release, there was no significant difference in bacterial clearance or adhesion.</p><p>Only one study has been found to utilize two separate tissue engineering scaffold techniques to simultaneously assess the release and bacterial clearance of MH [<xref rid="B23-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, this former study focused solely on how the changes in UMF of the honey affected its overall properties. No work has provided a comparison between tissue engineered scaffolds of varying geometry and the affect incorporating honey has on them. This study wishes to compare MH incorporated electrospun scaffolds (ES), hydrogels (HG), and cryogels (CG) to assess how the differences in geometry affect the porosity, bacterial clearance, and cell and bacterial adhesion with respect to MH. These three scaffold types possess a range of geometries and porosities, providing useful tissue-engineered techniques for incorporating MH, which can be tailored according to the desired application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-gels-05-00021"><title>2.

Visually, the addition of MH resulted in thicker ES fibers that appear to be blended together, with less obvious pores than the plain ES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B). This is supported in <xref rid="gels-05-00021-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> where the average fiber diameter of ES + MH scaffolds (0.85 &#x000b5;m) is significantly larger than that of the plain ES scaffolds (0.41 &#x000b5;m; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, with increasing fiber diameter the pore size was shown to decrease resulting in ES + MH scaffolds having a significantly smaller pore area than plain ES scaffolds, also seen in <xref rid="gels-05-00021-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Note that preparation for SEM involves lyophilizing the scaffold and, as hydrogels are primarily composed of water, the images are not an accurate representation of the surface of this scaffold [<xref rid="B39-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In comparison, the cryogels appear to have a very slight difference in pore size with the addition of MH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>E,F) where this difference was quantified using &#x000b5;CT in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1dot2-gels-05-00021">Section 2.1.2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-gels-05-00021"><title>2.1.2.

Note that due to fragility, HG scaffolds were excluded from &#x000b5;CT analysis.

Both full and partial clearance of bacteria was measured from the scaffold to the ring of clearance, providing a measurement of the average clearance radius around the scaffold.

Discussion</title><p>This study evaluated three varying types of tissue-engineered scaffolds (ES, HG, and CG) with and without the addition of MH. Previous work has demonstrated the ability to dope these scaffolds with MH, but no work has compared the varying effects on scaffold porosity, bacterial clearance, and bacterial and cellular adhesion. Due to the difference in fabrication techniques, these silk fibroin (SF)-based scaffolds are physically different, ranging from nanoporous fibrous mats (ES scaffolds) to macroporous sponges (CG scaffolds). Thus, it is of interest to assess and provide a side-by-side comparison of the effects of MH on the scaffold&#x02019;s pores and physical structure, as well as the variations in release on bacteria.</p><p>Initial analysis used SEM and &#x000b5;CT to provide both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the different scaffold types and any variations with the addition of MH. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>A demonstrates the fibrous mat of the ES scaffolds compared to the macroporous structure of the CG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). With the addition of MH, the ES scaffolds experienced a clumping of fibers and overall increase in fiber diameter which, consequently, decreased pore area, as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B) [<xref rid="B1-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B40-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While it appears that the CG pores decreased with the addition of MH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>E,F), analysis by &#x000b5;CT did not find a significant difference in the average pore diameter, heterogeneity, or connection density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f003">Figure 3</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). While previous work had found a significant decrease in pore diameter, these measurements were acquired by ImageJ which relies on a dehydrated section of the scaffold for analysis [<xref rid="B37-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Conversely, &#x000b5;CT provides a 3D measurement of the hydrated structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f003">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B23-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B41-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As noted previously, HG scaffolds are primarily composed of water and thus, SEM images do not provide an accurate representation of the scaffolds surface; however, the incorporation of MH did not visually alter the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). Future work could utilize liquid nitrogen for the dehydration process, as well as environmental SEM or optical microscopy following cryosectioning to improve visualization. Additionally, a more homogeneous analysis method should be identified to provide porosity quantification that can be compared across all tissue engineered scaffold types.</p><p>Due to the described changes in porosity and surface topography, it is of interest to evaluate the potential for cellular attachment. This study found that all tissue-engineered scaffold types supported cellular adhesion after only two hours of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f004">Figure 4</xref>). While the HG scaffolds did not display a difference in adhesion with the addition of MH, both ES and CG scaffolds had an increase in adhesion when MH was incorporated. SF is known to contain cell attachment sites which, in this study, supported adhesion on all scaffolds [<xref rid="B23-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous work has demonstrated that, in vitro, MH concentrations as low as 5% is cytotoxic for cells, attributed to the acidic pH in a closed-off environment [<xref rid="B7-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; however, due to the slow release and thus, lower quantity of MH released from the scaffolds, this does not occur with the ES, HG, or CG scaffolds. This study replicated the scaffold fabrication protocols from a previous body of work in which glucose release was evaluated over 14 days [<xref rid="B23-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, it was shown that 0.5 mg/mL of glucose was released from both ES and CG scaffolds for the first 24 h which subsequently decreased over the tested time period. This demonstrates the sustained MH release, as compared to a bolus of honey incorporated directly into the media. In a study by Hixon et al [<xref rid="B38-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], MH was shown to increase cellular infiltration, supporting the increased adhesion demonstrated in this study. Note that previous work has demonstrated that, despite the differences in pore size with the addition of MH, cells are able to infiltrate and proliferate through all scaffold types, suggesting that following successful adhesion, cells would migrate throughout the scaffold and support tissue formation [<xref rid="B22-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B37-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B42-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As there was a slight difference in SF concentration between the scaffold types, it is possible that this could influence scaffold structure and cell adhesion moieties; however, based on the data, the authors do not believe this difference to be significant as similar cell adhesion occurred prior to the addition of MH. Future work should focus in more detail on quantifying cell compatibility, adhesion, and infiltration potential, for example, through the examination of cytoskeletal proteins to further assess cell morphology. Additionally, a wide variety of cell types could be analyzed to provide an assessment of these different scaffold types compatibility for various tissue engineering applications.</p><p>Finally, the major benefit of MH in tissue engineering applications is its potential for bacterial clearance and inhibition. Previous work has demonstrated the clearance of various bacterium including <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref rid="B2-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This study chose to examine both the potential for clearance and adhesion, as well as the differences between scaffold types based on geometry. Following 24 h of incubation on <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the ES + MH scaffolds exhibited the highest partial clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f006">Figure 6</xref>). This is due to the ES geometry being composed of a flat mat of fibers which concentrates the MH at the surface of the scaffold and leads to an immediate amplified release. In comparison, both the HG and CG scaffolds possess a 3D geometry where the MH is distributed throughout, resulting in an extended release which has previously been shown to last between two and four weeks [<xref rid="B38-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B43-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Previous work has suggested that increasing surface roughness results in greater cell adhesion while others demonstrate the opposite, where there is decreased adherence. Additionally, differences in patterned surfaces has also been shown to decrease bacterial adhesion [<xref rid="B44-gels-05-00021" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In combination with the variations in geometry and presence of Manuka honey, it was anticipated that the tissue-engineered scaffolds in this study would exhibit differences in bacterial adhesion. While the ES scaffolds were the only scaffold to have a significant decrease in the degree of bacterial adhesion with the addition of MH, this may also be due to the difference in geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gels-05-00021-f008">Figure 8</xref>). With a fast release of MH, <italic>S. aureus</italic> was unable to adhere to the surface as readily as plain ES scaffolds. As both the HG and CG scaffolds have an extended MH release, less honey is released at each time point and the <italic>S. aureus</italic> can adhere more readily. Both release rates provide benefits for various tissues and applications based on the structural and antibacterial need. Future work could focus on the ratio of live and dead bacteria following adhesion to the scaffolds to further quantify the effects of MH. </p><p>Overall, this study provided an overview of the capability of incorporating MH in ES, HG, and CG scaffolds. It also demonstrated the effects of the additive on the scaffolds themselves, as well as the differences in <italic>S. aureus</italic> clearance and adhesion based on geometry and its overall effect on cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-gels-05-00021"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>Honey has been a target for bacterial inhibition and wound healing for centuries, experiencing a resurgence in popularity following the development of antibiotic resistance strains. This study chose to study three scaffolds formed through varying fabrication techniques (ES, HG, and CG scaffolds) and their impregnation with MH. While the incorporation of MH into varying scaffold fabrication techniques has previously been explored individually, no study to date has removed material differences and focused primarily on scaffold geometry and its impact on the overall effects of MH integration and release from the scaffolds. ES scaffolds were noted for their rapid MH release which resulted in significantly more partial bacterial clearance than other scaffold geometries (i.e., CG and HG formulations). These scaffolds also demonstrated a reduction in adhered bacteria, compared to control disks and other MH-containing scaffold geometries. This would indicate that despite the high surface area of the ES scaffolds which would lend itself to rapid bacterial colonization, the integrated MH was readily exposed on the surface of the generated fibers and reduced adhesion. This was a different response from the HG and CG scaffolds, which had a less immediate and noticeable impact on clearance and adhesion. We anticipate that the more-sustained release of MH here was due to its integration within the polymer networks of the scaffolds rather than being bound to a fiber surface. Future work should further explore cellular compatibility with a variety of cell types, as well as extended timepoints following adhesion to note the potential for cellular infiltration and colonization for the various scaffolds. All tissue-engineered scaffold types offer benefits for different wound healing applications, and this manuscript provides an overview of scaffold properties as well as the potential for bacterial clearance and cell adhesion as varied by scaffold geometry.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Adrian N.
