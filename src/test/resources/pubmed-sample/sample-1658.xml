Its active constituents are ginsenosides, a group of triterpene sapoins, which exhibit a large variety of biological activities, such as anti-tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, anti-inflammatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, anti-aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, etc. Of more than one-hundred kinds of ginsenosides, compound K (20-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxadiaol, CK) is a major deglycosylated metabolite form, which is absorbed and discovered in circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The diverse biological effects of CK is well explored and recognized, and with recent success in constructing &#x0201c;yeast factories&#x0201d; that can produce large amount of CK with high purity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, CK presents a promising potential therapeutic agent for many diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Many signaling pathways and molecular targets have been reported to mediate the diverse biological functions of CK. In tumor cells, CK exhibits a direct cytotoxic and growth-inhibitory effects via pathways including induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and increase of mitochondrial disruption. In atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> conditions, CK treatment can have anti-inflammation and anti-allergic effects, with molecular mechanisms mostly centered around inhibitory functions to NF- &#x003ba;B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and MAPK pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, ROS generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, NADPH oxidase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and production of inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Besides, depending on different cell types studied, many other targets have also been identified, e.g. AMPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, calcium flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, altogether constituting a complicated signaling network that can be influenced by CK treatment.</p><p id="Par4">Despite of all these efforts, there has been no systematic and unbiased analysis of potential downstream targets of CK so far. With recent advances in genome editing technologies, especially the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system, genome-wide genetic screening using CRISPR technologies offers a high-throughput, low-cost, and unbiased platform that enables comprehensive study of genetic regulators in a biological condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We thus wanted to employ this genetic screening approach to identify potential downstream targets of CK. To enable a successful genetic screening, we took advantage of a cellular condition that CK treatment can promote autophagic cell death, which allows a cell-survival-based readout for screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We then applied genome-wide CRISPR screening technology to this cell model. We have identified a number of &#x0201c;CK-resistant genes&#x0201d;&#x02014;loss of which can render cells more resistant to CK treatment; and &#x0201c;CK-sensitive genes&#x0201d;&#x02014;loss of which can make cells more sensitive to CK treatment, offering a useful resource for further exploring the molecular underpinnings to various biological activities of CK. Our study also demonstrates a broadly useful approach for studying the potential molecular targets of traditional herbal medicines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par5">Human embryonic kidney 293 T cells, human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells, and human hepatocarcinoma HuH-7 cells were purchased from Cell Bank (SIBS, Shanghai), and maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

The remaining cells after CK treatment also displayed significantly more autolysosomes, as compared to control cells, under the transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest autophagic cell death induced by CK treatment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Compound K treatment induces autophagic cell death in HeLa cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative images of cell state after CK (5&#x02009;nM) or DMSO treatment for 3 days, with or without pretreatment with 3-MA (5&#x02009;mM) for 1 day.

The membrane-bound microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 pro (LC3) is fused with green and red fluorescent proteins. GFP, but not mRFP, is unstable in acidic environment, and undergoes degradation in autolysomes. The GFP/mRFP ratio can therefore be calculated to estimate autophagic flux. HeLa cells were infected by lentivirus-mRFP-GFP-LC3 (Lenti-RGLC3), and then was treated with DMSO or CK for 1&#x02013;24&#x02009;h. Consistent with previous findings, the induction of autophagy was more obvious and the autophagic flux was significantly accelerated in CK-treatment groups, as compared to control cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). Further tests in full medium containing FBS also demonstrated the induction of autophagy and cell death upon CK treatment, albeit at a much higher concentration (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1c, d</xref>). Additionally, similar phenomenon was observed in HuH7 cells after CK treatment (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

GeCKO library lentiviruses were applied to infect HeLa cells at an efficiency of around 30%, to ensure that most of the cells were infected by one virus.

Cells infected with control virus were also treated with CK and used as a negative control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

We further validated <italic>PMAIP1</italic> as a CK-resistant gene and <italic>WASH1</italic> as a CK-sensitive gene, pointing out <italic>WASH1</italic> as an interesting downstream mediator of CK, which is involved in CK-induced autophagic cell death.</p><p id="Par34">In this study, we took advantage of a cellular condition that CK treatment induces autophagic cell death, offering a cell-survival-based readout for screening. While cell survival as a readout is often adopted and favorable in setting up high-throughput genetic screenings, this presents an extreme cellular condition, thus cannot represent many other functional effects of CK treatment. In the positive selection analysis, a number of candidate genes are involved in regulation of cell growth or apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which is in fact common in a cell survival based screening, and cannot being simply considered to be specific to CK treatment. However, there are also many other genes that are not functionally connected to cell survival that have being identified in the screening. It is interesting to see that genes enriched in the regulation of endocytosis and RNA biosynthetic process have been identified in positive selections, and genes enriched in many aspects of RNA processing and even nucleus organization have been identified in the negative selection. In fact, in the further validation experiments, we have confirmed <italic>WASH1</italic> as a CK-sensitive gene. CK treatment reduces the expression of WASH1 at both the transcriptional and translational levels, which further accelerates the autophagic cell death, with <italic>WASH-1</italic> depleted cells becoming hypersensitive to CK treatment. These results are consistent with the previous discovery that WASH1 is a negative regulator of autophagy. However, WASH1 is also an important regulator in endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, whether CK treatment can also affect cell endocytic trafficking and cargo sorting via WASH1 warrants further investigation. The presentation of RNA processing related genes in both positive and negative selection analyses, suggest that CK treatment may also affect RNA biology directly or indirectly, raising an interesting direction for further functional pursuing of ginsenosides.</p><p id="Par35">Taken together, our study, for the first time, has established a high-throughput genetic screening, by which a number of CK-resistant and CK-sensitive genes have been identified. We have also confirmed the involvement of two genes, <italic>PMAIP1</italic> and <italic>WASH1</italic>, in CK treatment induced autophagic cell death in HeLa cells. Many other targets will also need to be further validated before conclusions can be made. Nonetheless, our study reveals interesting targets of compound K, and offers one easy-to-adopt platform to study the potential functional mediators of ginsenosides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
