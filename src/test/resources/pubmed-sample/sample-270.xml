Haematopoietic progenitors are stimulated by growth factors and cytokines to proliferate and differentiate, and they die via apoptosis when these factors are depleted.

Both the natural and recombinant bomapin had a disulfide bond which linked the only two bomapin cysteines: one located in the CD-loop and the other near the C-terminus. Computer modelling showed that the cysteines are distant in the reduced bomapin, but can easily be disulfide-linked without distortion of the overall bomapin structure. Low-level ectopic expression of bomapin in bomapin-deficient K562 cells resulted in about 90% increased cell proliferation under normal growth conditions. On the other hand, antisense-downregulation of natural bomapin in U937 cells resulted in a decreased cell proliferation. Bomapin C395S mutant, representing the reduced form of the serpin, had no effect on cell proliferation, suggesting that the disulfide bond-linked conformation of bomapin is biologically important. The bomapin-dependent effect was specific for myeloid cells, since ectopic expression of the serpin in HT1080 cells did not change cell proliferation. In contrast to the survival-promoting activity of bomapin in cells cultured under optimal growth conditions, bomapin enhanced cell apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We propose that bomapin is a redox-sensitive nuclear serpin that augments proliferation or apoptosis of leukaemia cells, depending on growth factors availability.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mature blood cells arise in bone marrow from a small population of haematopoietic stem cells during the haematopoietic process. Haematopoietic stem cells give rise to erythroid/myeloid and lymphoid precursors which then continuously proliferate and differentiate to adult blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Biological functions of haematopoietic cells are tightly regulated with multiple growth factors and cytokines, and by interactions with other cells in bone marrow compartment. These factors determine the rate of haematopoietic cells renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. A failure to respond to external stimuli regulating these processes within bone marrow micro-environment may lead to haematological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The serpins (<underline>ser</underline>ine <underline>p</underline>rotease <underline>in</underline>hibitors) form a protein superfamily, with members identified in all organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although designated as protease inhibitors, serpins have also other functions that are not related to their inhibitory activity. All serpins have a common tertiary structure with a dominant &#x003b2;-sheet A supporting a mobile reactive centre loop (RCL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The P1-P1' peptide bond in the RCL acts as a bait for target proteases. Serpins inhibit their target proteases by a mechanism that involves cleavage of the RCL and its insertion into &#x003b2;-sheet A, with simultaneous translocation of the covalently-bound protease to the opposite pole of the serpin molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The serpins that have been studied most extensively are extracellular proteins. They control proteases in various patho-physiological processes, including inflammation, coagulation, and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The human genome encodes 35 serpins, which are grouped into nine clades (A-I). The clade B includes 13 intracellular serpins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some of them are cross-class inhibitors, inhibiting both serine and cysteine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Eight of them have a unique inter-helical loop, the so-called CD-loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which is an important functional domain of the serpins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although the clade B serpins are thought to regulate apoptosis or cell differentiation, their targets remain mostly unknown.</p><p>Bomapin (serpinb10) belongs to the clade B of human serpins. It is expressed only in bone marrow, leukocytes of patients with myeloid leukaemia that correspond to myeloid progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and promyelocytic leukaemia cell lines (HL60, THP1, and AML-193), but it is not present in terminally differentiated leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This protein has a 22 amino acid-long CD-loop that contains a nuclear localization signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Bomapin is assumed to have P1-Arg at its reactive centre which is consistent with <italic>in vitro </italic>inhibition of thrombin and trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Bomapin complex with a possible intracellular protease was detected in HeLa cells over-expressing the serpin, but the protease was not identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It was proposed that bomapin possibly regulates a protease in the early stages of hematopoietic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the roles of bomapin and its intracellular partners still remain unknown.</p><p>The main focus of the present studies is to determine the biological role of the haematopoietic-specific bomapin. We show that naturally expressed human bomapin is located in the nucleus, where it exists in an oxidized form with a single disulfide bond. We show also that bomapin has the capacity to influence the fate of myeloid progenitors/leukaemia cells by enhancing their proliferation under optimal growth conditions, or by sensitizing them to apoptosis when the growth conditions are improper. This function of bomapin may be of particular importance because a tight regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and balance between the two processes, are critical for normal haematopoietic process and for preventing haematological diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bomapin has reactive cysteines that form intramolecular disulfide bond</title><p>Bomapin was expressed in a thioredoxin reductase deficient <italic>E. coli </italic>strain, and purified by sequential metal-affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. From the ion-exchange column, bomapin eluted in two partially overlapping peaks; the first peak contained bomapin monomer, whereas the second peak contained mainly bomapin dimer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 1 and 4) and small amount of higher order oligomers (data not shown). Interestingly, the purified monomeric bomapin migrated on non-reducing SDS-PAGE as a strong 40-kDa band, and as a weak 45-kDa band (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 1). However, only the 45-kDa band was present under reducing conditions (lane 2). This difference in electrophoretic mobility suggests that the only two bomapin cysteines, C68 (located in the middle of the CD-loop) and C395 (located close to the C-terminus), form an intramolecular disulfide bond. The oxidized and reduced monomeric forms of bomapin, as well as oligomeric species of the protein, were active as inhibitors since they formed an SDS-stable complex with trypsin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 3 and 6). As shown by an indirect chromogenic assay, bomapin was able to inhibit about 90% of trypsin activity at bomapin/trypsin 0.87 molar ratio, and at 1.74 ratio all trypsin was inhibited (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This data suggest that bomapin forms 1:1 complex with trypsin, and support the general model for 1:1 complex formation between serpin and protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Conformation of the recombinant and naturally expressed bomapin is redox-dependent</bold>.

Since nuclear proteins can be stabilized by disulfide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the redox status of the nuclear bomapin became of particular interest. Thus, bomapin was immunoprecipitated from HL60 cells and analyzed by 7% SDS-PAGE followed by western blot. The electrophoretic migration of the naturally expressed bomapin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) resembled that of the recombinant protein, suggesting that majority of natural bomapin exists in the oxidized form which contains the intramolecular C68-C395 disulfide bond. In contrast to <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressed bomapin, we have not detected disulfide-linked dimers for the naturally-expressed bomapin.</p><p>To provide a structural reference for the redox forms of bomapin, models of the reduced and oxidized forms of bomapin were constructed using homology modelling and simulated annealing calculations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In the model of reduced bomapin, cysteines C68 and C395 are separated by a distance of about 30 &#x000c5;, they are surface-exposed and likely to take part in redox reactions. The entire CD-loop (residues 62 to 86) is located on the side of the bomapin molecule. Secondary structure predictions using APSSP2 server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/apssp2/">http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/apssp2/</ext-link> predicts random coils structure from Asn 62 to Glu 72 and between Leu 83 to Ser 86, and a helical tendency between Ser 73 and Asn 82. Thus, the CD-loop can be predicted to be flexible, and it can therefore easily be translocated so that the C68-C395 disulfide bond can be introduced without apparent perturbation of the overall structure of bomapin.</p></sec><sec><title>Wild-type bomapin promotes proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells</title><p>To investigate the role of bomapin, we stably transfected K562 cells with bomapin-EGFP fusion or EGFP alone.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, bomapin-EGFP cells had about 90% higher cell density at 96 h of incubation than those expressing EGFP. Proliferation of wild-type (wt) K562 cells, although slightly higher than for EGFP cells, was still significantly lower than for bomapin-EGFP cells. Bomapin-EGFP cells metabolized the WST1 reagent faster than the EGFP cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Finally, the nuclei of bomapin-EGFP cells were about 50% larger than the nuclei of EGFP cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Doubling time during the linear phase of cell growth was shorter for bomapin-EGFP cells (25.8 &#x000b1; 0.6 h) than for EGFP cells (35.6 &#x000b1; 3.0 h) and wt K562 cells (29.5 &#x000b1; 2.5 h). However, as shown by DNA-flow cytometry analyses, the cell distribution in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases for bomapin-EGFP cells (43.9, 32.5, and 19.9%, respectively) was similar to that for EGFP cells (41.7, 32.2, and 21.5%, respectively), suggesting that bomapin had no effect on distribution of cells during the cell cycle. In addition, the difference in percentage of trypan blue-positive cells for exponentially growing bomapin-EGFP cells (2.4 &#x000b1; 0.2%) and the control EGFP cells (2.9 &#x000b1; 0.3%) was not statistically significant, suggesting that the increased proliferation of bomapin-EGFP cells can not be explain by a lower apoptosis rate.</p><p>To show that native bomapin also has en effect on cell proliferation, we incubated U937 cells with bomapin-specific antisense (BAS3) or sense (BS) DNA oligonucleotides. Proliferation of all oligonucleotide-treated cells was lower than proliferation of untreated U937 cells, which can possibly result from the known slightly toxic effect of the nucleotides on cells. Nevertheless, the antisense-treated cells had decreased bomapin levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), and had about 40% lower cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), compared to the cells incubated with the sense oligonucleotide. In addition, U937 cells incubated with BAS3 metabolized less WST-1 reagent than the control U937 cells incubated with BS (data not shown).</p><p>To find out whether bomapin can influence proliferation of other cells, not only myeloid progenitors, we expressed bomapin in HT-1080 cells. In these cells, bomapin-EGFP was also located in the nucleus (data not shown), and was expressed to a similar level as it was in leukaemia cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), but it had no effect on cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bomapin mutant lacking disulfide bond has no effect on cell proliferation</title><p>As majority of natural bomapin was found in the conformation where the CD-loop was linked to C-terminal part of the protein via a disulfide bond, it was of interest whether the oxidized form of bomapin is important for the observed bomapin effect on cell proliferation.

Expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, this mutant was active as inhibitor and formed an SDS-stable complex with trypsin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

Expression level of the C395S mutant in K562 cells was also similar to the wild type bomapin (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, proliferation of the cells that were expressing the C395S-bomapin-EGFP mutant was identical to that of the control cells expressing EGFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

Any failure to respond to stimuli regulating these processes may lead to leukaemia. Many transcription factors that regulate the haematopoietic processes have been described. However, the downstream pathways, including regulation of various factors by proteases - and control of the latter by specific inhibitors - are less well defined. In this study, we have used leukaemia cells as a model of myeloid progenitor cells. We have shown that the haematopoietic-specific bomapin (serpinb10) is a nuclear, redox-sensitive protein that enhances proliferation of myeloid leukaemia cells under normal growth conditions, and enhances apoptosis of the cells following growth factors withdrawal.</p><p>Bomapin has two cysteines: C68 which is located in the long CD-loop, and C395 located close to the C-terminus. Molecular modelling of bomapin suggests that these cysteines in the reduced form of bomapin are distant, solvent-exposed and predicted to be highly reactive. Due to a high potential flexibility/mobility of the CD-loop, the cysteines can be disulfide-linked to form intramolecular disulfide bond without major perturbations of the bomapin structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). The high reactivity of both cysteines is supported by the fact that bomapin expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>was present in the form of oxidized monomer (having the two cysteines connected by disulfide bond), and disulfide-linked dimers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitated naturally expressed bomapin showed that majority of the protein existed in the oxidized monomeric form with intramolecular disulfide bond (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). There is a theoretical possibility that bomapin was artificially oxidized during immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, however, the fact that disulfide-linked conformation of bomapin is important for an enhanced cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) strongly suggests that the oxidized monomers of bomapin existed already in intact cells. In contrast to the bacterial-expressed bomapin, we have not observed any oligomeric species for the naturally expressed bomapin in leukaemia cells. This could be due to low bomapin levels (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and crowding effect in nucleus, or known differences in redox environment between nucleus of human cells and bacterial cytoplasm.</p><p>Although it is generally known that cytosolic compartment of eukaryotic cells has a high reducing potential which prevents the formation of stable disulfide bonds in proteins, relatively less is known about redox potential of nuclear compartment. However, several reports show that nuclear proteins may exist in oxidized forms with disulfide bonds of functional importance. For example, lamins-A/C, which are structural proteins of nuclear envelope, have to be in the form of disulfide-stabilized dimer to be able to bind chromatin DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; formation of a single intramolecular disulfide bond in transcription factor Yap1 is responsible for redistribution of the protein into nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; disulfide-linked form of clusterin is known to accumulate in nuclei of early apoptotic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the existence of a disulfide bond in naturally expressed bomapin is consistent with its nuclear localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The disulfide bond also appears to be essential for the function of bomapin since only wt/oxidized bomapin, but not the C395S mutant, was capable of enhancing proliferation of K562 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These data suggest that the oxidised conformation of bomapin is important for an interaction of the serpin with another nuclear protein, and that bomapin effect on cell proliferation might be dependent only on the redox status of bomapin. However, with the current knowledge, we can not exclude a scenario where bomapin inhibitory activity is also involved, but it becomes essential only after the oxidized bomapin binds to its nuclear partner. Bomapin is a second, after its closest homologue plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2, serpinb2), redox-dependent intracellular serpin. For PAI-2, the formation of a single disulfide bond between cysteines located in the CD-loop and at the bottom of the serpin molecule, induces conformational changes which result in spontaneous non-covalent polymerization of the serpin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but biological function of the conformational switch is unknown.</p><p>To study intracellular function of bomapin, we took advantage of the fact that the human K562 cells do not express bomapin naturally (real-time PCR and immunoprecipitation, data not shown; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), and stably transfected the cells with bomapin-EGFP fusion, or EGFP as a control. Consistent with previous studies on HeLa cells over-expressing GFP-bomapin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the bomapin-EGFP fusion in K562 cells had a dominant nuclear distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Expression of bomapin-EGFP in K562 cells resulted in about 90% higher cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), and a significant shortening of the cell cycle without changes in distribution of cells in different phases of cell cycle. Bomapin-EGFP expressing cells had also bigger nuclei than the control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). On the other hand, down regulation of bomapin expression in U937 cells by means of antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a decreased cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), suggesting that the bomapin effect on cell proliferation was not specific for the K562 cells only. However, the effect of bomapin on cell proliferation was leukaemia/haematopoietic-specific because expression of bomapin-EGFP in the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells did not change proliferation of the cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). This strongly suggests that bomapin needs a haematopoietic-specific partner protein to enhance cell proliferation. Two other serpins from clade B have been reported to influence cell proliferation. The first one is rat trespin which is believed to be a homolog of human bomapin, but it is expressed in various tissues whereas bomapin is bone marrow-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; over-expression of trespin in human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line (Hek293) resulted in an increased proliferation of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The second one is kidney-specific mouse megsin which is responsible for increased proliferation of messangial cells in megsin-transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The mechanism(s) behind serpin-dependent enhancement of cell proliferation remains yet unknown.</p><p>Bone marrow haematopoietic progenitors, quiescent without stimulation, can be activated to proliferate and to differentiate by cytokines and growth factors. When growth factor levels decrease, the cells undergo mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis that leads to termination of cell expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In contrast, leukemic cells cultured in the absence of growth factors can continue to proliferate and evade apoptosis for a long time. In the case of K562 cells, the aberrant Bcr/Abl fusion kinase activates both proliferation and anti-apoptotic signals that are responsible for relatively high proliferation rate of these cells, and their resistance to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, bomapin-EGFP expressing K562 cells cultured without serum showed an increased cell accumulation in S-phase and increased apoptosis, compared to the control cells expressing EGFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Therefore, bomapin antagonise the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcr/Abl fusion and sensitizes K562 cells to apoptosis when growth factors are absent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hematopoiesis requires a tight balance between proliferation and apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors. This balance is controlled by many factors, including cytokines and growth factors. Although precise signalling pathways and downstream effectors balancing proliferation and apoptosis are not fully known, they may involve AKT, E2F1/Rb protein, and/or Myc signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These signalling pathways respond to growth factor levels by inducing cell proliferation or cell apoptosis. Here we show that bomapin, a nuclear and redox-sensitive protein, can stimulate proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells under normal growth condition, and can increase apoptosis of the cells following the growth factors removal. We therefore propose that bomapin is involved in a pathway that sensitizes myeloid progenitor cells to growth environment. Since proper regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis is essential for normal hematopoiesis and for prevention of leukemic transformation, the function of bomapin described here may be of considerable importance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of bomapin from <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>The <italic>BamH1 </italic>and <italic>Xho1 </italic>restriction sites in the pET15b vector (Novagen) were flipped using Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and primers: 5'-CTGGTGCCGCGCGGCAGCGGATCCCTCCTCGAGCCGGCTGCTAACAAAGCCCG-3' and 5'-CGGGCTTTGTTAGCAGCCGGCTCGAGGAGGGATCCGCTGCCGCGCGGCACCAG-3'.

However, the common characteristic of these cells is that their differentiation is blocked at early stages of myeloid differentiation: the HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukaemia) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukaemia) cells represent multipotent myeloid progenitors, and U937 (histiocytic lymphoma) and THP-1 (acute monocytic leukaemia) cells represent monocytic progenitors. The K562 cells (naturally bomapin-deficient), as well as U937, HL60, and THP1 cells (all expressing bomapin) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium. The human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells (bomapin-deficient) were cultured in DMEM medium. All media were substituted with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml), and penicillin (100 U/ml) (all from Gibco BRL).

The pd2EGFP-N1 vector encodes for a destabilized bomapin-EGFP fusion protein with a half-life of about 2 h. K562 cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), selected with Geneticin (0.6 mg/ml, Life Technologies), and sorted with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). To correct for clone variation, all experiments were performed on a multiclonal pool of the stably transfected cells. Proliferation of K562 cells expressing wt bomapin was increasing with increasing cell generation number, whereas proliferation of K562 expressing the C395S bomapin mutant was decreasing with higher generation number.
