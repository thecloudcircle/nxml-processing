In addition, a high accumulation of sorbitol promoted necrosis. This synergetic interplay between salicylic acid and ethylene was further supported by the fact that increased <italic>myo</italic>-inositol accumulation significantly delayed leaf senescence in <italic>MdMIPS1</italic>-overexpressing apple lines.

In higher plants, MI is incorporated into phosphatidylinositol phosphate, MI polyphosphates, and certain sphingolipid-signaling molecules that function in various processes, such as solute synthesis (galactinol and raffinose-family oligosaccharides)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, stress tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and regulation of cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, the oxidation product of MI, <sc>d</sc>-glucuronic acid (GlcA), is further utilized for the synthesis of cell wall pectin and noncellulose compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">MI biosynthesis involves three successive steps: (1) phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase (HXK); (2) conversion of G6P to <italic>myo</italic>-inositol-1-phosphate by <italic>myo</italic>-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (MIPS); and (3) dephosphorylation of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol-1-phosphate to MI by <italic>myo</italic>-inositol monophosphatase (MIPase) (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. MIPS is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of MI and its derivatives, and its evolutionary profile suggests that it is an ancient protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although yeast and animals contain only one <italic>MIPS</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, plants possess multiple <italic>MIPS</italic> paralogs, suggesting a functional divergence of MIPS in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For instance, Donahue et al. reported that three <italic>MIPS</italic> genes were expressed differently in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and suggested a key role of AtMIPS1 in MI biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The <italic>atmips1</italic> mutant, which is characterized by a reduced MI level, displays pleiotropic developmental defects, including reduced root growth and altered venation in its cotyledons. Moreover, a striking feature of the <italic>atmips1</italic> loss-of-function mutant is the light intensity-dependent formation of leaf lesions due to programmed cell death (PCD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A reduced MI level was also reported to result in pleiotropic phenotypes, such as advanced leaf senescence (a slow form of PCD), in MIPS-suppressed transgenic potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.) plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">PCD is essential for plant growth and development and also plays a role in the response of plants to stress, such as pathogen infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide ion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) as well as the phytohormones salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) appear to be key factors in PCD regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In plants, ROS are constantly generated in multiple cellular compartments, such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. Although the generation of ROS is rapidly triggered by various kinds of biotic stresses, ROS can also act as signaling molecules. Moreover, they are also toxic byproducts of aerobic metabolism. Excessive production of ROS leads to irreversible oxidative stress and, ultimately, cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. As a result, plants have evolved various ROS-scavenging mechanisms, including the production of enzymatic antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and the production of nonenzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. SA is a crucial plant hormone that mediates pathogen defense responses and leaf senescence and often interacts with ROS to regulate plant oxidative stress and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that SA can promote H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation by compromising the activity of antioxidant enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, disruption in SA biosynthesis can prevent lesion formation in the <italic>atmips1</italic> mutant via an SA induction-deficient 2 (<italic>sid2</italic>) mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The gaseous phytohormone ET has vital roles in many aspects of plant growth and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. As critical enzymes catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the ET biosynthetic pathway, both 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) are regulated at different levels by a complex signaling network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, ET production is associated with wounding, pathogen attack, anaerobiosis, senescence, and oxidative stress. ET has also been suggested to be a positive regulator of ROS production and a disseminator of cell death signaling (or senescence)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear whether ET is involved in MI-mediated PCD in plants.</p><p id="Par6">Apple (<italic>Malus domestica</italic>) is one of the most popular and culturally important fruit crop species worldwide.

Three candidates, MDP0000698835, MDP0000207103, and MDP0000459576, were identified and subsequently designated MdMIPS1, MdMIPS2, and MdMIPS3, respectively. The similarity was the highest between MdMIPS1 and the three AtMIPSs, and the highest similarity of the MdMIPSs was shared with AtMIPS3 (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a, b</xref>). Alignment of the coding region sequences revealed that MdMIPS3 has a partial sequence corresponding to that of MdMIPS2 (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>), suggesting that MdMIPS3 arose from a fragment duplication of MdMIPS2 in parallel with the events of apple whole-genome duplication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. <italic>MdMIPS1</italic> and <italic>MdMIPS2</italic> encode proteins of 509 amino acid residues; these genes share 95.37% and 96.47% identity in their coding region and amino acid sequence, respectively. Both MdMIPSs and AtMIPSs have a highly conserved pentapeptide in their core catalytic domain (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>), suggesting that they have biochemically similar MIPS properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, the results of reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the expression profiles of <italic>MdMIPS1</italic> and <italic>MdMIPS2</italic> in Royal Gala were similar, with both showing relatively high expression in the leaves and fruits (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2c</xref>).

Indeed, RNA-seq analysis revealed strong enrichment in senescence-related processes in the MdMIPS1-RNAi lines, supported by the fact that the MI level decreased in the aging leaves. By contrast, an increased MI level in MdMIPS1-OE apple lines delayed leaf senescence. It seems that increased MI biosynthesis could compensate for the normal decrease in the MI level, thereby suppressing SA-mediated and ET-mediated signaling in MdMIPS1-OE apple lines during leaf senescence.
