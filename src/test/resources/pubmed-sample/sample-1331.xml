We have shown that ghrelin also induces insulin resistance via GH-independent mechanisms, but it is unknown if this effect depends on ambient fatty acid (FFA) levels. We investigated the impact of ghrelin and pharmacological antilipolysis (acipimox) on insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism in 8 adult hypopituitary patients on stable replacement with GH and hydrocortisone using a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design: Ghrelin infusion, saline infusion, ghrelin plus short-term acipimox, and acipimox alone. Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity was determined with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in combination with a glucose tracer infusion. Insulin signaling was assayed in muscle biopsies. Peripheral insulin sensitivity was reduced by ghrelin independently of ambient FFA concentrations and was increased by acipimox independently of ghrelin. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was increased by acipimox. Insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle were not consistently regulated by ghrelin. Our data demonstrate that ghrelin induces peripheral insulin resistance independently of GH, cortisol, and FFA. The molecular mechanisms remain elusive, but we speculate that ghrelin is a hitherto unrecognized direct regulator of substrate metabolism. We also suggest that acipimox <italic>per se</italic> improves hepatic insulin sensitivity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Ghrelin is the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue receptor (GHS-R)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and potently stimulates the release of GH and - to a lesser degree - ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>It is well documented that GH is lipolytic and induces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Our data demonstrate that ghrelin <italic>per se</italic> induces peripheral insulin resistance independently of ambient FFA levels.</p><p>We have previously reported that ghrelin infusion increases serum FFA levels in hypopituitary patients which could imply a direct lipolytic effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. This was not reproduced in the present study, where serum FFA levels during ghrelin infusion vs. saline were similar. It is possible that this discrepancy reflects a dose-dependent lipolytic effect of ghrelin, inasmuch as the dose employed in the present study was 5-fold lower and thus more physiological as compared to our previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. It remains to be experimentally tested whether ghrelin stimulates lipolysis or FFA turnover in a dose-dependent manner, but regardless of that, our data reveals a direct FFA-independent effect of ghrelin on peripheral insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Acipimox is an antilipolytic nicotinic acid analogue, which binds to a G-protein coupled receptor &#x02013; &#x0201c;<italic>protein upregulated in macrophages by interferon-&#x003b3;&#x0201d;</italic> (PUMA-G/HM74) &#x02013; in adipose tissue and thereby inhibits the hormone sensitive lipase (HSL)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> resulting in acute suppression of systemic FFA levels and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The present study documents these effects and confirms that acipimox also improves hepatic insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The latter effect of acipimox is unmasked by our model with stabilized GH levels, inasmuch as acipimox is known to increase GH secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, which in turn induces hepatic (and peripheral) insulin resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We therefore suggest that our model is well suited to study the direct effect of acipimox and also propose an explanation as to why hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity frequently fails to improve following acipimox administration to subjects with an intact anterior pituitary function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In line with previous studies we recorded a stimulatory effect of acipimox on plasma glucagon concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, which may represent a compensatory mechanism.</p><p>Skeletal muscle uptake accounts for approximately 80% of infused glucose during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, but it has proven difficult to demonstrate a link between the diabetogenic effects of ghrelin to the insulin signaling pathway in human skeletal muscle biopsies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Likewise, no evidence of impaired insulin signaling at the level of protein expression or phosphorylation could be recorded in the present study. It is possible that more frequent biopsies in combination with activity assays might provide additional sensitivity to our human <italic>in vivo</italic> model, but it is also possible that <italic>in vitro</italic> studies or transgenic mice models may be necessary to unveil the molecular mechanism.</p><p>Ghrelin infusion increased both acyl ghrelin and desacyl ghrelin levels to supraphysiologic concentrations in line with earlier reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, which supports that acyl ghrelin is metabolized to desacyl ghrelin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Surprisingly, acipimox reduced both ghrelin and desacyl ghrelin concentrations at baseline, which is interesting since desacyl ghrelin exposure has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>Both ghrelin and acipimox are recognized as potent GH secretagogues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Our participants all had documented GH deficiency as a consequence of pituitary disease, yet we did record a minimal increase in serum GH levels when ghrelin and acipimox were co-administered. This observation indicates synergy between the GH secreting effects of ghrelin and acipimox and is in line with effects reported in healthy elderly men treated with acipimox and the GH-secretagogue GHRP-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. This response could theoretically have impacted on glucose and lipid metabolism, but it was not accompanied by detectable activation of GH signaling in skeletal muscle. Taken together, we find it unlikely that it could account for the metabolic effects of ghrelin observed in our study.</p><p>Baseline plasma glucose concentrations were not increased by ghrelin alone, which is in line with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> but plasma glucose levels during administration of ghrelin plus acipimox were elevated as compared to the levels recorded after acipimox alone, which appeared to increase plasma glucagon levels. This lack of effect of ghrelin on glucose concentrations contrasts with our earlier data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, but, again, in the present study we used a more physiologic ghrelin infusion rate and the present data are in line with other clinical trials using a similar ghrelin infusion rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Plasma insulin and ghrelin appear to correlate inversely. Physiological ghrelin concentrations inhibit insulin secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and vice versa. It is speculated that lower ghrelin levels in obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and type 2 diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> may represent a counter-regulatory mechanism against hyperglycemia.</p><p>Some limitations apply to our study. The number of participants was relatively small, the age and BMI ranges were relatively large, and the study included male patients only. However, the crossover design minimizes inter-individual differences and ensures that the observed effects of ghrelin and acipimox are not attributable to differences in the study population.</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that ghrelin induces acute peripheral insulin resistance via mechanisms that are independent of GH, cortisol, and ambient serum FFA levels but does not impact on hepatic insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Vestergaard, E.
