However, not all smokers are ready and willing to give up smoking. Thus, a GP focusing on smoking cessation alone might waste the opportunity to improve his patient&#x02019;s health by supporting a change in another harmful behaviour pattern. The aim of this study is to determine whether multi-thematic coaching will lead to higher overall health benefits without resulting in a reduced rate of successful smoking cessations, compared with a monothematic smoking cessation approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study is designed as a two-armed, double-blinded, cluster-randomised trial. GPs will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. In the intervention group, GPs will undergo training in patient-centred coaching, shared decision-making and motivational interviewing. The control group will be trained in a state-of-the-art smoking cessation algorithm.</p><p id="Par3">GPs will approach adult cigarette-smoking patients and advise those included according to the GP&#x02019;s group affiliation. The primary outcome is the between-group&#x000a0;difference in the proportion of participants who achieve a beneficial change in at least one of seven different health-related behavioural dimensions, 12&#x02009;months post baseline. Secondary outcomes include smoking cessation rates and the patients&#x02019; self-perceived smoking-related motivation, self-efficacy and planning behaviour. Additionally, covariates describing both GPs and patients will be collected before the start of the intervention, and process outcome measures in compliance with the RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance) framework will be recorded during the ongoing study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Tobacco consumption is still highly prevalent in the general population and often goes hand in hand with other behaviour patterns with adverse health effects. This study will add to the literature regarding effective strategies available to GPs to address unhealthy behaviour among their smoking patients beyond mere smoking cessation counselling. The study will also establish a basis for decisions about further promotion and dissemination of the coaching under study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ISRCTN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN38129107">ISRCTN38129107</ext-link>.

For this purpose, standardised brief interventions involving both counselling and supporting drug therapy have been established and evaluated for the primary care setting over the last years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">However, not all smokers are ready and willing to give up smoking. Therefore, up-to-date stop-smoking programmes are based on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and thus take the patients&#x02019; readiness to stop smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] into account.</p><p id="Par11">The patient-centred &#x0201c;Health Coaching&#x0201d; programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], developed by the Swiss College for Primary Care Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], is based on similar principles. Remarkably, this programme does not focus on smoking cessation or any other single health behaviour alone but includes several health-related behavioural dimensions in parallel. Particular emphasis is put on the patient-driven choice of which topic to address. The Health Coaching programme has proved its efficiency and practicability in a clinical trial carried out within the setting of primary care practitioners in eastern Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Combining state-of-the-art&#x000a0;smoking cessation counselling with the Health Coaching&#x000a0;approach, exploring patients&#x02019; motivation for smoking cessation can be expanded into a more comprehensive exploration of their readiness to improve their health in any prioritised topic, hopefully leading to additional benefits beyond those gained from tobacco abstinence. We assume that training the GPs&#x02019; communication skills and incorporating elements of shared decision-making and motivational interviewing into the counselling process will lead to higher overall health benefits for smokers. Importantly, this broader perspective of health behaviour changes should not be paid for in lower smoking cessation rates in comparison with patients exposed to an intervention tailored to smoking cessation alone.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study hypothesis</title><p id="Par13">We hypothesise that multidimensional and patients&#x02019; motivation-driven brief interventions by GPs improve several relevant health outcomes of smokers. We assume that these improvements surpass the beneficial effects of monothematic state-of-the-art smoking cessation counselling, and we further assume that the smoking cessation rates achievable through the novel interventions are not inferior to those known from state-of-the-art smoking cessation counselling.</p><p id="Par14">To verify these hypotheses, we plan to train the GPs in the intervention group in how to coach smokers according to the Health Coaching programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while the control group GPs will undergo training in monothematic smoking cessation counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par15">A cluster randomised controlled trial (randomisation on the GP level) will be conducted with 60 German-speaking GPs from the northern part of Switzerland (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the study flow chart).

Included GPs must not have had any previous training in the Health Coaching programme.</p><p id="Par17">In a first step, all members of an interested network of GPs will be invited through a formal letter from the Institute of Primary Care of the University of Zurich. In case of insufficient response, email remainders will be sent out before other doctors&#x02019; networks will be included in the recruitment process, and addresses of potential participants from existing in-house and freely accessible federal databases of primary care providers will be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cluster randomisation</title><p id="Par18">Participating GPs will be listed chronologically, and GP characteristics collected prior to their allocation to either intervention or control arm. Until their required number is reached (according to the sample size calculation), the GPs will be allocated to the two equally sized study arms in blocks of 14&#x02013;20 GPs each, by means of a tailored covariate constrained randomisation procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] with an additional constraining criterion regarding potential contamination. In some more detail, a set of sufficiently balanced allocations with regard to the&#x000a0;GPs' sex, contract status and practice type will be constructed and then purged from contamination-prone allocations (i.e. from those which put GPs belonging to the same group practice into different study arms), before randomly drawing the final allocation to be used in the study. All GPs from the same group practice will be allocated within the same block.</p><p id="Par19">The block size was chosen to meet recommendations by Carter and Hood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and also&#x000a0;with a view to training group sizes that can well be handled within the study centre&#x02019;s resources. To generate the set of balanced allocations, we will use the web-based Shiny Balancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the additional reduction step will be carried out manually using Excel&#x02019;s sorting and filtering capabilities. The final random draw will be carried out by a study nurse not involved in the later data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient recruitment and allocation</title><p id="Par20">All GPs will be asked to approach, consecutively and regardless of the reason for the consultation, current cigarette smokers at least 18&#x02009;years old. By insisting on consecutive targeting of <italic>all</italic> smokers, we aim to eliminate selection bias very likely to arise if GPs were allowed to select patients whom they deem suitable. In order to include a total of 200 patients, each of the 60 GPs is expected to recruit three to four patients on average.</p><p id="Par21">Patient inclusion criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par22">Current cigarette smoker.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">Male or female over 18&#x02009;years of age.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">Registered as patient in the recruiting GP&#x02019;s patient base.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Capable of judgement with regard to participation in the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">Signed informed consent after being informed.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par27">Patient exclusion criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par28">Severe general or psychiatric illness (e.g. malignancy, major depressive episode, dementia, etc.).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Inability of the participant to follow the procedures of the study due to other reasons (e.g. language problems).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Foreseeable change of general practitioner within 1 year (e.g. due to planned relocation).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par31">Any participating patient will be assigned to the trial arm of his GP without involving further randomisation, and subsequently a set of baseline characteristics (biological and social traits and particulars of their smoking habits) will be collected from every patient included. Since not all GPs might recruit the exact same number of patients and due to the deterministic allocation of patients, we expect to record&#x02014;and document&#x02014;some inevitable imbalance between the trial arms with regard to patient numbers and (patient) baseline characteristics. On the other hand, randomness in the GPs' appointment schedules together with consecutive patient inclusion and coupled with the patients&#x02019; blinding with regard to the intervention (see next subsection) will translate into largely randomly composed study clusters. This will prevent extremely imbalanced trial arms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par32">Considering the nature of the interventions, full blinding of GPs and their patients in the strictest sense is not possible. However, in order to achieve the highest possible degree of double-blinding, both GPs and patients will merely be informed that the intervention is aimed at promoting beneficial health-related behaviour changes among smokers, but neither GPs nor patients will be told which of the two interventions (study or control) they provide or receive. Before consenting to participate, the patients will not be offered detailed information about the intervention they will receive, nor will they know details about the intervention in the respective other trial arm during the ongoing study. For those GPs or patients familiar with clinical studies, a minimum amount of related information will be available from registry databases and from the published protocol, which we consider inevitable.</p><p id="Par33">At the end of the study, GPs will be debriefed and those in the control arm will be offered training in Health Coaching too. Ethical approval has been granted for the blinding procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par34">Both the study and the control intervention consist of a communication training session for the participating GPs, identical in duration and organisation but different in content. Training sessions will take 4&#x02009;h and involve standardised patients (i.e. actors posing as patients) and case vignettes tailored to health-related behaviour counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The 60 GPs will be split into groups of 7&#x02013;10, and each group will then be trained within a short interval of time.</p><p id="Par35">The 30 control group GPs will receive training in smoking cessation counselling as put forward by Frei von Tabak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The training of the 30 GPs in the study arm will cover the key elements of the Health Coaching programme, namely patient-centred counselling, shared decision-making, motivational interviewing and the use of validated tools from existing health promotion programmes such as PAPRICA&#x02014;Physical Activity Promotion in Primary Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Brief Interventions in Patients with Risky Alcohol Consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and aTavola (a short intervention programme for healthy eating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Like their counterparts in the control group, the GPs in the intervention group will also be trained in smoking cessation counselling according to Frei von Tabak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The intervention on the patient level will consist of either activating and coaching patients in achieving a beneficial change of their self-selected unhealthy behaviour (study intervention group) or of smoking cessation counselling (control group) in up to three (or occasionally, if necessary, more) sessions. The number of sessions will depend on progress and the needs of the patients and will be decided on by both patients and their physicians.

The success rate of 15% in the control group is the sum of a 10% smoking cessation rate achievable by state-of-the-art smoking cessation counselling according to Comuz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] plus an estimated 5% of &#x0201c;spontaneous&#x0201d; effects of smoking cessation counselling on one of the other behavioural dimensions.

To reflect the correlation structure of the clustered design, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 4% was assumed, which is slightly higher than corresponding values suggested by Parker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], in order to account for rare cases of GPs from the same group practice. This assumption is also backed by (unpublished) calculations from the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] with similar cluster structure and outcome. Correction for the cluster effect increases the sample size to 166 &#x000b7; [1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(4 &#x02013; 1) &#x000b7; 0.04]&#x02009;=&#x02009;186 or roughly 200 patients, assuming that a general practitioner is able to recruit four patients. Finally, allowing for a dropout rate of 15% among general practitioners, 186 / 4 / (1 &#x02013; 0.15)&#x02009;=&#x02009;56 (rounded to the next higher even number) or roughly 60 general practitioners must be recruited to detect the expected difference in the primary outcome between the two study arms.</p><p id="Par53">Sample size calculations with respect to the non-inferiority hypothesis require additional assumptions. In the earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], 12% of smoking or non-smoking GP patients chose smoking cessation as their primary goal.

Based on Lindson-Hawley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we further assume a 40% success rate among the highly motivated.

It is largely unknown how&#x02014;in terms of health benefits&#x02014;a change in some behaviour dimension A compares with a change in another dimension B, and we know of no standardisation procedure to make sizes of changes comparable over different dimensions. To make matters worse, different behaviour changes are measured on different scales, and&#x000a0;health benefits have been associated with absolute changes in some measures but with relative changes in others. We believe that, given these imponderabilities, the binary outcome &#x0201c;any relevant change in any component dimension&#x0201d; keeps the utmost possible intrinsic validity, since, firstly, the validity of the individual relevance criteria has been demonstrated and, secondly, no further assumptions on interaction or comparability of different behaviour changes are needed. Moreover, while using a dichotomous primary outcome measure inevitably incurs some loss of information, the study findings will be all the more meaningful for clinical care, provided that a statistical difference will be found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The loss of information will be compensated for by analysing secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Time aspects</title><p id="Par64">Evaluating primary and secondary outcomes at 1, 6 and 12&#x02009;months after baseline will allow capturing both easy-to-achieve early and hard-to-achieve late behavioural changes.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and the last two correspond to the Russel Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] for smoking cessation trials. Data collection at three different times will also provide information on the sustainability of beneficial behaviour changes at the level of the study collective, although not at the individual level. Duration of upkeep of beneficial behaviour patterns was not included among the primary or secondary outcomes because we do not know whether, for example, one sustained change is preferable over two different changes of short duration. However, we will assess the persistence of individual successes beyond follow up as part of the process evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Rationales for the choice of relevance criteria</title><sec id="Sec27"><title>Smoking</title><p id="Par65">Within the present study, we consider halving the daily number of cigarettes as sufficiently associated with health benefits. We realise that the evidence supporting this criterion is not overwhelming, and there might even be no benefit in terms of mortality at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. On the other hand, the rate of smoking-related cancers or lung cancers was considerably lower even in Tverdal and Bjartveit&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], although not significantly so as in Godtfredsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The two studies are somewhat contradicting in terms of size and significance of the effect, which suggests that a reduction by 50% might represent the limit of detection of health benefits from smoking reduction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Body weight</title><p id="Par66">A pro-rata weight loss of 5% is widely accepted as &#x0201c;clinically relevant&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;clinically significant&#x0201d;, see for example Stevens et al.

Swift et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], for example, demonstrated a significant beneficial effect on insulin levels whereas other cardiovascular risk factors showed short of significant changes in the desirable directions after clinically significant weight loss due to a weight reduction intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Physical activity</title><p id="Par67">Current guidelines recommend a minimum of 150&#x02009;min of physical activity per week of at least moderate intensity (corresponding to &#x02265;&#x02009;7.5 MET&#x02219;h). Beneficial health effects have been satisfactorily demonstrated for roughly 60% of this amount, for example by Wen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. See&#x000a0;also the recommendations of the US Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. According to both sources, additional health effects have been shown for further activity increases by the same amount. Equivalent amounts or equivalent <italic>additional</italic> amounts of physical activity can be achieved with similarly beneficial results at lower intensities but with longer duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">The obvious and tempting idea of using tracking devices had to be discarded on the grounds of practicability (distribution and maintenance of the devices), methodological considerations (recording of baseline activity before the first coaching or counselling session) and due to the sheer costs of providing appropriate sensors to all 200 participants. Out of consideration for the participants (who need to document their health behaviour in all seven dimensions) we also decided against relying on diaries to capture the amount of physical activity. This decision is backed by Timperio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], who point out that the use of physical activity logbooks does not increase estimates of validity of 7-day recall physical activity questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Alcohol consumption</title><p id="Par69">The cardioprotective role of alcohol consumption has most probably been overestimated in the past. Recent research, for example, by Rehm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] suggests a dose&#x02013;risk relationship with a less pronounced J-shape compared to older results. According to Rehm et al., health risks exceed benefits for any amount of alcohol consumed beyond 10&#x02009;g per day, irrespective of sex and age. The 2000 WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] show increasing all-cause mortality estimates for intake classes starting from 10&#x02009;g/day with class widths of 10&#x02009;g/day. Our choice of criterion reflects both the cut-off point as well as this magnitude of change, but is based on a weekly assessment as used in most current guidelines on alcohol consumption.</p><p id="Par70">We decided against extending the criterion to cover drink-free days because their benefit is still highly debatable and probably dependent on the total amount consumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In accordance with measuring physical activity and because the effort was again not deemed reasonable for the patients, we do not intend to use diaries or logbooks that would have to be filled in over several days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Stress level</title><p id="Par71">The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] was chosen for its widespread recognition and frequent use in psychometric research, for the availability of a free and validated German translation, and for its briefness and practicability. Furthermore, the PSS-10 is one of only few scales for which we were able to find satisfactory data describing quantitatively the score changes after stress relief interventions or the association between changes of the score and health outcomes.</p><p id="Par72">Two relatively small studies by Wiegand et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Kirby et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], both carried out in non-clinical community settings and with baseline PSS-10 scores of approximately 24 (scale ranges from 0 to 40), found mean decreases in the total PSS-10 scores by about 6.3&#x02013;9 after stress management interventions of 14&#x02009;weeks or 10&#x02009;days, respectively, and about 4.1&#x02013;5 in the control groups. Based on these data we consider a score reduction by at least 5 as a relevant change. This choice gets some empirical support from results of validation studies that established standard deviations in the order of our criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and showed that our criterion roughly corresponds to the mean difference between psychiatric outpatients and the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Eating habits</title><p id="Par73">Concerning food intake there is a vast number of short dietary assessment instruments and screeners available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] but none of them has prevailed as a generally recognised standard to capture overall diet quality in the primary care setting. The ideal tool was expected to cover the patient&#x02019;s diet as a whole and without including food items unusual in a typical &#x0201c;local&#x0201d; diet. Furthermore, it was required that laypeople would be able to complete it within reasonable time and without expert knowledge, for example, about different nutritional components of various foods. Lastly, and if at all possible, it had to be validated with respect to some quantifiable morbidity or mortality outcome. The MedDietScore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] meets these requirements best.</p><p id="Par74">Again, we do not intend to use food diaries for similar reasons as mentioned earlier with respect to physical activity and alcohol consumption.

However, there are some important limitations. The necessity to collect data regarding seven different behaviour dimensions requires a significant effort on the part of the participants. Overstraining their cooperation would most likely result in losses to follow up and poor data quality. In the context of the present study, it is therefore not possible to capture all behaviour changes with the highest desirable objectivity. Even though validated measuring instruments will be used as far as possible, recall and desirability bias as well as interpretation bias cannot fully be ruled out. Moreover, some of the chosen cut-off levels for clinical relevance are somewhat debatable. Lastly, we will not be able to completely avoid the selection of suitable cases either on the level of GPs or on the level of patients, even though the consecutive recruitment of patients will prevent the selection of &#x0201c;good risks&#x0201d; by their GPs up to a certain extent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Desired impact</title><p id="Par76">The knowledge gained from this study is likely to influence the way GPs deal with harmful behaviour patterns of their patients who smoke.

If shown to be effective and feasible, a coaching strategy as set out in the Health Coaching programme and adopted in this study, focusing on shared decision-making and the promotion of the patients&#x02019; intrinsic motivation to tackle their individual health problems, could ultimately reduce the high prevalence of risk behaviours in the smoking population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par77">Patient recruitment had&#x000a0;not yet started at the time of the first submission in February 2018 and is planned to take part from late 2018 until mid-2019.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec36"><p>
