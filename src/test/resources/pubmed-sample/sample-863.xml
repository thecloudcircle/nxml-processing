These pathological damages occur throughout the course of COPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B/transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1/Smads2 signaling pathway as an important pathway involved in inflammation and remodeling is closely related to the progress of COPD. NF-&#x003ba;B, a transcriptional activation protein, is widely involved in various biological processes, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, immune response, etc. The phosphorylation of NF-&#x003ba;B can initiate the gene transcriptions and expressions of various cytokines, amplify the inflammatory response through a positive feedback cascade. Additionally, NF-&#x003ba;B can also promote the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 and activate TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smad2 signaling by binding with NF-&#x003ba;B combining site locating in TGF-&#x003b2;1 activating factor-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) gene promoter
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;1, an important proinflammatory cytokine with strong fibrotic effect, plays a critical role in inflammatory injury and repair as well as airway remodeling in COPD by activating Smad2, a downstream receptor kinase of TGF-&#x003b2;1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The effects of NF-&#x003ba;B/TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads pathways are as follows: 1) to promote the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, augment inflammatory response; 2) to induce fibroblast cell differentiation into highly synthetic myofibroblasts and arguably transdifferentiation of epithelial cells into fibroblasts, produce more cytokines to aggravate the lung injury; 3) to increase the production of collagen fibers, elastic fibers and reticular fibers, promote them deposit in the cell membrance, which may lead to airway wall thickening and ultimately aggravate airflow limitation; 4) to increase the secretion of the extracellular matrix components (such as bronchopulmonary tissue fibronectin, collagen type III and I glycoprotein, etc.) and finally result in airway plasticity decreasing and remodeling

In previous investigations, we found that the patterns of lung-spleen qi (vital energy in life body) deficiency, lung-kidney qi deficiency and lung-kidney qi-yin (vital energy in life body and its material base, such as blood, flesh, bones, etc.) deficiency were the most common syndromes in the stable stage of COPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Accordingly, we formulated the three Tiao-Bu Fei-Shen (Bufei Jianpi/invigorating the lung and strengthening the spleen, Bufei Yishen/invigorating the lung and reinforcing the kidney, Yiqi Zishen/replenishing qi and nourishing the kidney) therapies and granules. In two previous randomized controlled trials, we found that the three Tiao-Bu Fei-Shen granules can alleviate clinical symptoms in stable COPD patients, reduce frequency and duration of acute exacerbation and improve pulmonary function, exercise capacity and stamina and quality of life
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In animal studies, it indicates that the three TCM granules can reduce pulmonary and systemic inflammation, decrease collagen deposition and metalloproteinase expression, reduce pathological impairment and improve pulmonary function and have marked long-term effects

Bufei Jianpi, Bufei Yishen and Yiqi Zishen therapies and granules are the corresponding rules and medicines of treatments
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Previously completed multicenter clinical trials had shown that Bufei Jianpi, Bufei Yishen and Yiqi Zishen granules can improve pulmonary function, reduce the incidence and duration of acute exacerbation, improve patients&#x02019; quality of life, have beneficial long-term effects after a 12-month follow-up
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of Bufei Jianpi, Bufei Yishen and Yiqi Zishen granules on pulmonary inflammation, airway remodeling and explore the role of NF-&#x003ba;B/TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smad2 signaling pathway on COPD rats.</p><p>Airway remodeling and airflow obstruction, resulted from chronic inflammation occurring in the central and peripheral airways as well as lung parenchyma, play important roles in the development of COPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B and TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads signaling pathways are the most important two paths involved in the course of inflammation and remodeling. NF-&#x003ba;B, a pivotal transcription factor of the inflammatory response, can be activated by numerous stimuli and participate in the regulation of hundreds of genes by binding to discrete DNA sequences, known as &#x003ba;B elements, in gene promoters and enhancers, such as TGF-&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, etc.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The expressions of NF-&#x003ba;B in plasma and sputum in COPD patients and smokers with normal lung function increase significantly compare with normal control subjects. IL-6, a downstream cytokine of NF-&#x003ba;B pathways, increased along with NF-&#x003ba;B
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Decreasing of phosphorylation of NF-&#x003ba;B can decrease the levels of downstream cytokines, reduce the inflammatory response in lungs of COPD, improve pulmonary function and finally reduce the incidences of acute exacerbation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1, a multipotential cytokine with strong fibrogenic effect, is presented in many tissues and cells in human body and is the most abundant isoform in the superfamily of transforming growth factors and with both structural and inflammatory cells being sources of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the lungs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, TGF-&#x003b2; receptors are suggested to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of COPD through their regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads pathways. A previous study suggests that pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling can protect the murine lung from altered lung histology, impaired lung function and a panel of injury measures that accompany cigarette smoke-induced COPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>There are strong interactions between NF-&#x003ba;B and TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads signaling to form NF-&#x003ba;B/TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads pathway as TGF-&#x003b2; can be administrated by NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. NF-&#x003ba;B/TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads pathway leads on a global stage in airway inflammation and remodeling in COPD.</p><p>In this study, we have found that phosphorylation levels of NF-&#x003ba;B and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, mRNA expressions of TGF-&#x003b2;1 and Smad2 increased significantly in the lungs of COPD rats. Bufei Jianpi, Bufei Yishen and Yiqi Zishen granules can reduce the phosphorylation of NF-&#x003ba;B and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; proteins and depress TGF-&#x003b2;1 and Smad2 mRNA expressions at both week 20 and 32. It indicates that the three Tiao-Bu Fei-Shen granules have a dramatic short- and long-term effect on reducing pulmonary pathological impairment and inflammatory responses, improving airway remodeling via regulating NF-&#x003ba;B/TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smad2 signaling. However, as the three traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions are very complicated compounds, it need more further study to determine what the exactly constituents make it work.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests and they don&#x02019;t receive any funding by Pharmaceutical factory.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LY, LJS and LSY contributed to the study design.
