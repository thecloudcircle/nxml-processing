Although A&#x003b2; levels can lead to insulin signaling impairment, these experiments were done in the absence of human ApoE. To examine ApoE role, we crossed the human ApoE-targeted replacement mice with mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice. In 26 week old mice with lower A&#x003b2; levels, the expression and phosphorylation of insulin signaling proteins remained comparable among APP, ApoE3xAPP and ApoE4xAPP mouse brains. When the mice aged to 78 weeks, these proteins were markedly reduced in APP and ApoE4xAPP mouse brains. While A&#x003b2; can bind to insulin receptor, how ApoE isoforms modulate this interaction remains unknown. Here, we showed that ApoE3 had greater association with insulin receptor as compared to ApoE4, regardless of A&#x003b2;42 concentration. In contrast, ApoE4 bound more A&#x003b2;42 with increasing peptide levels. Using primary hippocampal neurons, we showed that ApoE3 and ApoE4 neurons are equally sensitive to physiological levels of insulin. However, in the presence of A&#x003b2;42, insulin failed to elicit a downstream response only in ApoE4 hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data show that ApoE genotypes can modulate this A&#x003b2;-mediated insulin signaling impairment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive deterioration of memory and other cognitive faculties, ultimately leading to dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The pathological hallmarks of AD include the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. While AD remains a multi-faceted disease, the human apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele was identified to be the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD cases, where its expression accelerates the onset of the disease in a gene-dose dependent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>In the brain, ApoE can be produced by both glia and neurons under physiological and pathological conditions, and its classical role is to redistribute lipids among cells in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. ApoE exists in three isoforms, ApoE2 (cys112, cys158), ApoE3 (cys112, arg158) and ApoE4 (arg158, arg158). The ApoE3 genotype occurs in ~80% of most populations; whilst ApoE4 and ApoE2 occurs in ~14% and &#x0003c;7% respectively. By contrast, ApoE4 occurs in &#x0003e;50% in AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The presence of a cysteine or arginine residue at positions 112 or 158 profoundly changes the tertiary structure and functionality of the protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Unlike the other two isoforms, ApoE4 exists in a &#x0201c;molten globule&#x0201d; formation, which makes it more prone to proteolytic cleavage. This hinders the protein from carrying out its regular functions and may also result in the formation of neurotoxic ApoE4 fragments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>As it is widely believed that the development of AD pathology begins decades before the emergence of symptoms and substantial neurodegeneration, it is important to understand the disease at its earliest possible stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Interestingly, the AD brain has been described to be in an &#x0201c;insulin resistant&#x0201d; state, while aberrant insulin signaling has been identified as an early risk factor for the disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In postmortem brain samples, insulin and insulin receptors were markedly reduced in postmortem AD brains, and insulin sensitivity was impaired in the hippocampal formation of AD samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These data indicate that insulin sensitivity is associated with AD, at least at the end stage.</p><p>Insulin is taken up by the brain from pancreatic sources but also produced by neurons in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Insulin is crucial for maintaining neuronal survival, differentiation, metabolism and learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Although insulin receptors are found throughout the brain, they are concentrated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and the olfactory bulb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The insulin signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of insulin to the extracellular subunit of the insulin receptor (IR&#x003b1;). This results in the autophosphorylation of the intracellular subunit of the insulin receptor (IR&#x003b2;), providing docking sites for the immediate downstream effector, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). Recruitment of IRS-1 propagates the signaling cascade, with IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation leading to PI3K p85 docking and the activation of kinases such as Akt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The activation of Akt promotes neuronal survival, and is known to contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP) and CREB phosphorylation at serine residue 133 (S133), which are relevant to memory consolidation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Clinical data have shown that increased insulin administration improved the performance of elderly individuals in learning and memory tasks, and performance is correlated to lowered levels of plasma APP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. These insulin treatment effects are ApoE isoforms dependent; ApoE4 carriers showed no improvement in memory tasks and no reduction to plasma APP levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In addition, reports have shown that in the presence of A&#x003b2;, ApoE targeted therapy, anti-diabetic agents or insulin sensitivity itself can reduce the load of amyloid plaques or lead to LTP formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest that the insulin sensitivity is changed in the presence of amyloid pathology, and such modulation could be ApoE isoform dependent. However, how ApoE isoforms differentially modulate insulin sensitivity in the presence A&#x003b2; is still unknown.</p><p>To examine the connection between ApoE isoforms and brain insulin signaling in AD, we created a preclinical mouse model by crossing human ApoE-targeted replacement mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> with mice carrying familial-AD (FAD) mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This mutant APP bears the Swedish (K670N/M671L) and the Indiana (V717F) mutations (APPSwdInd). In this study, we examined both ApoE3 and ApoE4, since these isoforms occur in ~94% of most populations and are represented in &#x0003e;99% of sporadic AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>Studies have reported significant cognitive impairment in female ApoE4 mice as compared to male ApoE4 mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

Interestingly, the presence of ApoE4 alone did not lead to a defective response to physiological levels of insulin, and the response of ApoE4 hippocampal neurons to insulin alone was comparable to the response of ApoE3 hippocampal neurons. However, in the presence of A&#x003b2;42, physiological levels of insulin failed to elicit a downstream response in ApoE4 hippocampal neurons. In contrast, ApoE3 hippocampal neurons remained sensitive to 2&#x02009;nM insulin, despite the presence of A&#x003b2;42. Our data demonstrated that the presence of both ApoE4 and A&#x003b2;42 led to insulin signaling impairment in hippocampal neurons, and we asked what could be the possible difference in the nature of ApoE3 and ApoE4 that might account for this.</p><p>Although differential binding between ApoE isoforms and A&#x003b2; were reported, the results were inconsistent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.

Nevertheless, this differential ApoE-A&#x003b2; binding could influence A&#x003b2; pathogenic effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>.</p><p>While A&#x003b2; had been shown to bind to the insulin receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, ApoE isoforms interactions with the IR were not studied. Here, we showed that ApoE3 had a greater association with the insulin receptor at every age, regardless of A&#x003b2;42 concentration. In contrast, ApoE4 had a weaker association with the insulin receptor, independent of age and A&#x003b2;42 levels.</p><p>Using ApoE3 and ApoE4 targeted replacement mice, we showed that even with the same levels of A&#x003b2;42, ApoE4 still had a much lower capacity to associate with the insulin receptor, further confirming our mouse brain immunoprecipitation data. However, at 78 weeks, we observed a slight increase in ApoE4 association with the insulin receptor. This slight increase in the insulin receptor bound might not due to ApoE4 associating with the insulin receptor, but the net effect of A&#x003b2;42 binding to the insulin receptor, which was detected while being pulled down<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>In summary, this study suggested that the ApoE4 genotype could lead to an earlier impairment of brain insulin signaling, possibly contributing to an earlier onset of AD. Our results also showed that this ApoE isoform dependent effect on brain insulin sensitivity was modulated by the difference in ability of the ApoE isoforms to associate with the insulin receptor.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments involving the use of animals and primary hippocampal neuron cultures were carried out in accordance with protocols R13&#x02013;4468 and BR 13&#x02013;4458 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the National University of Singapore.

The blot shown was one of three experiments using different primary hippocampal cultures. Blot images were cropped for comparison. Each value represents the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM and the relative value for each treatment was normalized against no treatment (NT) of the same hippocampal cell line. One-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in P-IRS-1 Y608, P-Akt S473 and P-Akt T308 expression among treatments within each cell line (**p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep13842-f5"/></fig></floats-group></article>
