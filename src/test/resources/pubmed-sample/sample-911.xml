It has been demonstrated in our previous research. The extraordinary feature of this nucleus is that it is not connected to any parenchymal organ but to the CSF. In primates, however, the presence or absence of this nucleus has not been proven. Confirmation of the presence of this nucleus in primates will provide the structural basis for brain-CSF communication and help to understand the neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The tracer cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CB-HRP) was injected into the CSF in the lateral ventricle (LV) of primate rhesus monkeys. After 48 h, the monkeys were perfused and the brain was dissected out, and sectioned for CB-HRP staining. The CB-HRP positive structures were observed under confocal and electron microscopy. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster was reconstructed by computer software.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>(1) CB-HRP labeling is confined within the ventricle, but not leakage into the brain parenchyma. (2) From the midbrain inferior colliculus superior border plane ventral to the aqueduct to the upper part of the fourth ventricle (4V) floor, a large number of CB-HRP positive neurons are consistently located, form a cluster, and are symmetrically located on both sides of the midline. (3) 3D reconstruction shows that the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster in the monkey brain occupies certain space. The rostral part is large and caudal part is thin appearing a &#x0201c;rivet&#x0201d;-like shape. (4) Under electron microscopy, the CB-HRP positive neurons show different types of synaptic connections with the non-CSF-contacting structures in the brain. Some of the processes stretch directly into the ventricle cavity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Same as we did in rats, the CSF-contacting nucleus is also existed in the primate brain parenchyma. We also recommend listing it as the XIII pair of cranial nucleus, which is specialized in the communications between the brain and the CSF. It is significant to the completing of innervation in the organism.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CSF-contacting nucleus</kwd><kwd>primate</kwd><kwd>rhesus monkey</kwd><kwd>cerebrospinal fluid</kwd><kwd>innervation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">81371243</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81901131</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004608</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">BK20190987</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">China Postdoctoral Science Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002858</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">2018M642328</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="18"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The animal body consists not only of parenchymal organs, but also of fluids (such as brain interstitial fluid, plasma, and CSF). Physiology studies suggest that the levels and composition of the body fluids are also coordinated under the instructions from the brain (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agnati et al., 2017</xref>). The components of the plasma, CSF, and the brain extracellular fluid are different and these fluids are physically separated from each other (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Rambeck et al., 2006</xref>). How does the central nervous system relay the information to these fluids and functionally modulate their levels and composition remains to be answered.</p><p>In the past 30 years, our studies revealed that after injecting peripheral nerve tracer CB-HRP into the rat ventricular system, the tracer is confined to the ventricular wall because of the existence of the brain barriers. The CB-HRP positive neuron cluster is always present at the ventral gray of the lower part of the aqueduct and the upper part of the 4V floor (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Only the neural processes that stretch into the CSF can be labeled. These neurons have a consistent location, form an independent cluster, occupy a certain space, and have a clear boundary with the nearby structures. The CSF-contacting neurons cluster is in accordance with the definition of the nucleus. Therefore, we name it as the &#x0201c;cerebrospinal fluid-contacting nucleus&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;CSF-contacting nucleus&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Song and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Studies have confirmed that the CSF-contacting nucleus has broad synaptic and non-synaptic connections with the other neurons and the blood vessels, and has the morphology for sensing and modulating the body fluids (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2020a</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of this special structure not only brings new insights to the knowledge of the brain but also describes the &#x0201c;source&#x0201d; regulating the physicochemical property and biological composition of the CSF under different physiological or pathological conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it provides the morphological evidence of systemic effects after interventions via body fluids (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies were only in rats, the presence or absence of this nucleus has not been proven in primates. The presence of the CSF-contacting nucleus in primates has implications to provide the structural basis for brain-CSF communication and help to understand the neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms in humans.</p><p>The present study is the first to describe the CSF-contacting neurons distribution, their nearby structures, 3D spatial morphology, and the synaptic and non-synaptic transmissions between the CSF and the brain parenchyma in primates. This study will provide scientific evidence and theoretical basis of the CSF-contacting nucleus in the primate&#x02019;s brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>Adult male rhesus monkeys (average weight of 5.64 &#x000b1; 2.10 kg) were acquired from the Kunming Primate Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, license number SCXK (Dian) K2017-0003.

The tracer is localized on the walls of these structures and forms a clear outline. The present study in rhesus monkey confirms that the CB-HRP can only flow within the ventricular system and cannot pass through the CSF-brain barrier and leak into the brain parenchyma. Thus, the neurons whose processes stretch into the CSF can be labeled by CB-HRP. Therefore, the CB-HRP positive neurons observed in our study can only be the CSF-contacting neurons. The reason is that it has been proved repeatedly that there is an objective existence of the CSF-brain barrier.</p><p>Naming a nucleus in the brain is a very serious scientific question. It must satisfy strict naming conditions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Blumenfeld, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Purves, 2012</xref>). (1) Similar morphology and functions: In the present study, all of the CB-HRP positive neurons are CSF-contacting neurons whose functions are specified for information connection between the brain and the CSF. (2) Similar location and occupy certain space: The CB-HRP positive neurons are located in the ventral gray of the aqueduct and 4V floor, form an independent cluster and are significantly different from the nearby structures. The three-dimensional reconstruction results show that the entire morphology of the nucleus presents &#x0201c;rivet-like&#x0201d; shape and occupies a certain spatial volume. (3) The distribution characteristics have an evolutionary similarity: In both, rodents as well as in primates, the CSF-contacting nucleus initiates ventral of the xscp and ends at the ventral gray of the 4V floor. The core of the nucleus is located at the ventral gray of the Aq and the nearby structures are DR, PAG, and mlf. The CSF-contacting nucleus in the monkey brain is larger than that in the rats, however, the position and shape are similar. The morphology of the nucleus is highly homologous between the two species. Therefore, we have sufficient evidence suggesting that the CSF-contacting nucleus exists objectively in primates.</p><p>The animal body is composed of not only parenchymal organs, but also includes fluids such as brain extracellular fluid, plasma, and CSF. It is believed that the body fluids are modified by the brain for specific functions. For example, neurons release to nearby extracellular fluid through autocrine or paracrine way to complete intercellular communication (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Lozic et al., 2018</xref>). Hypothalamic pituitary portal system regulates systemic function via releasing neurohormone into blood (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, 2015</xref>). However, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), an important part of the body, has not been reported to be regulated by a certain nucleus before.</p><p>Our study shows that the CSF-contacting nucleus is also existed in primates. Its position is in the pons, including the isthmic region. Although located in the brain parenchyma, it is different from other nuclei in the brain. Its characteristic is that the cell body is in the brain parenchyma, and the processes extend in the CSF, which indicates the characteristics of peripheral nerves similar to 12 pairs of cranial nerves. We recommend listing it as the XIII pair of cranial nucleus, whose basic function is to mediate the information transmission between brain and CSF. This is also very important and necessary in the body, which is of significance to the completing of innervation in the organism. Certainly, deep research is needed to address the further conclusions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets presented in this study are included in the article/supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>S-YS and L-CZ designed the study and prepared the manuscript.
