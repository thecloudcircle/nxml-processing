In earlier qualitative studies, C1q has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL). However, little is known about the role of this complement in ENL reaction. In the present study we described the protein level of C1q production and its gene expression in the peripheral blood and skin biopsies in patients with ENL reaction and lepromatous leprosy (LL) patient controls before and after treatment. Thirty untreated patients with ENL reaction and 30 non-reactional LL patient controls were recruited at ALERT Hospital, Ethiopia. Peripheral blood and skin biopsies were obtained from each patient before and after treatment. The level of circulating C1q in the plasma was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expression of the three C1q components, C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC in the peripheral blood and skin biopsies was determined by qPCR. Circulating C1q in the peripheral blood of untreated ENL patients was significantly decreased compared to LL patient controls. Untreated ENL patients had increased C1q gene expression in the peripheral blood compared to LL controls. Similarly, C1qA and C1qC gene expression were substantially increased in the skin biopsies of untreated ENL patients compared to LL controls. However, after treatment none of these genes show significant difference in both groups. In conclusion, while circulating C1q is inversely correlated with active ENL reactions, its gene expression is directly correlated with ENL. The decreased circulating C1q may suggest the utilization of C1q in immune-complex formation in these patients. Therefore, C1q could be a potential diagnostic marker for active ENL reactions as well as for monitoring ENL treatment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a painful inflammatory reaction which occurs in patients with lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy. The diagnosis of ENL is mainly based on clinical signs and symptoms and there is no definitive laboratory diagnosis. The causes of ENL are not fully understood but immune-complexes and T-cells activation are among the main factors described by researches. Complement C1q is a protein which initiates the classical complement pathway to form antigen-antibody complex (immune-complexes) which is normally removed before deposition. However, we do not have clear information on the role of C1q in patients with ENL reaction. Therefore, we investigated the production and gene expression of C1q in patients with ENL reaction and in non-reactional LL patient controls before and after corticosteroid treatment of ENL cases. We found that the amount of circulating C-q protein was significantly reduced in untreated ENL patients compared to non-reactional LL patients and healthy controls. On the other hand, the gene expression of C1q in peripheral blood and skin biopsies had been considerably higher in untreated ENL patients compared to LL patients controls. Both C1q protein and gene expression were not significantly different between the two groups after corticosteroid treatment of ENL cases. The decreased C1q protein in untreated ENL may indicate the consumption of C1q in immune-complex formation in these patients and suggests that the involvement of immune-complex in the pathogenesis of ENL. Hence, C1q could be used as a potential candidate marker for ENL diagnose in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Homes and Hospital of St Giles</institution></funding-source><award-id>PhD grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6632-3142</contrib-id><name><surname>Negera</surname><given-names>Edessa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The research was funded by Homes and Hospital of St Giles as a PhD fund granted to Edessa Negera.

The disease manifests with a spectrum of clinical pictures ranging from the localized tuberculoid leprosy (TT) through borderline forms to the generalized lepromatous leprosy (LL) of the Ridley-Jopling (RJ) classification [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune-mediated inflammatory complication affecting about 50% of patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) and 10% of borderline lepromatous (BL) patients [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ENL first occurs as acute but may pass in to a chronic phase or can be a recurrent [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It involves multiple organs and manifests as systemic illness [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The occurrence of crops of tender erythematous skin lesion is the clinical diagnostic of ENL [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Histologically, the infiltrations of neutrophils throughout the dermis and subcutis is the defining characteristic of ENL[<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, not all clinically confirmed ENL cases have neutrophilic infiltration in the lesions.</p><p>ENL is mainly diagnosed clinically and if the facility is available supported by histological findings. Nevertheless, no clinical or laboratory tests accurately predict who is most likely to develop ENL reaction or when it might occur.</p><p>C1q is one of the several candidate markers proposed for ENL diagnosis in earlier studies [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, little is known about the possible role of complement in ENL reaction. Recently the complement system have been perceived as a central constituent of innate immunity, defending the host against pathogens, coordinating various events during inflammation, and bridging innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Complement system not only protect the host against infection but also contribute to the amplification of inflammation if activated in excess or inappropriately controlled [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>C1q is a 460-kDa protein made up of 18-subunit glycoprotein consisting of 3 subunits: A, B and C which are coded by <italic>C1qA</italic>, <italic>C1qB</italic> and <italic>C1qC</italic> genes respectively. It has been shown that C1q is assembled in a 1:1:1 ratio from these three different subunits. The three human C1q genes are closely located on chromosome 1 and arranged <italic>C1qA-C1qC-C1qB</italic> orders [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is believed that C1q is mainly produced by macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has been reported that IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6 promote C1q production by macrophages while IL-1 inhibits its production by macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. C1q initiate the classical complement pathway. However, recently it has been shown that C1q is also involved in non-complement activation such as modulating dendritic cell maturation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T- and B-cell responses [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Increased C1q production in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) compared to latent TB has recently been reported indicating the potential use of C1q as biomarker to discriminate between patients with active TB cases from latent TB [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. C1q has also been implicated in several immune-complex disorders such as acute glomerulonephritis [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and acute systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Previous qualitative studies looked at C1q in the immunopathology of ENL and reported that serum samples from leprosy with or without reaction confer similar results[<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, serum samples from leprosy with or without reaction showed positive test. A recent microarrays study in the PBMCs of 3 ENL and 3 T1R patients has reported increased expression of the classic complement pathway particularly complement C1qA, B, C and the complement receptor C3AR1 and C5AR1 [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Increased fluorescent intensity of C1q in skin lesions of these patients has also been reported in the same study. Therefore, the association of C1q with the pathophysiology of ENL need to be explored in large number of ENL patient cohort. In the present study, the circulating C1q in the peripheral blood of patients with ENL and LL controls before and after prednisolone treatment was quantified using a special C1q-ELISA. The gene expression of C1q (C1qA, C1qB and C1qC) was quantified in peripheral blood and skin biopsies of these patients by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) before and after prednisolone treatment of ENL patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>Informed written consent for blood and skin biopsies were obtained from patients following approval of the study by the Institutional Ethical Committee of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, (#6391), AHRI/ALERT Ethics Review Committee, Ethiopia (P032/12) and the National Research Ethics Review Committee, Ethiopia (#310/450/06).

The patients were classified on the leprosy spectrum based on the Ridley-Jopling (RJ) classification schemes [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ENL was clinically diagnosed when a patient with BL or LL leprosy had painful crops of tender cutaneous erythematous skin lesions [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. New ENL was defined as the occurrence of ENL for the first time in a patient with LL or BL. Lepromatous leprosy was clinically diagnosed when a patient had widely disseminated nodular lesions with ill-defined borders and BI above 2 [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Patients with ENL were treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) treatment guideline with steroids that initially consisted of 40mg oral prednisolone daily and the dose was tapered by 5mg every fortnight for 24 weeks. All patients were received WHO-recommended leprosy multidrug treatment (MDT). We also included 15 apparently healthy volunteers and used for C1q ELISA result comparison only.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Blood and skin biopsy samples</title><p>Ten micro-litter of venous blood was collected into sterile BD heparinised vacutainer tubes (BD, Franklin, Lakes, NJ, USA) before and after prednisolone treatment of ENL cases on week 24 from each patient and healthy controls. Plasma was separated and used for ELISA. In addition, 2mL of blood was collected into PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytix, GmbH, Switzerland) before, and after prednisolone treatment for mRNA isolation and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Six-mm punch biopsy was taken from each patient before and after prednisolone treatment into a to a Nunc tube containing 1mL RNAlater solution (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and was kept at -20&#x000b0;C for 48 hours and then transferred to -80 <sup>o</sup>C freezer.

The procedure is briefly described as follow as: The microwell plate coated with monoclonal antibody to human C1q was aspirated and washed twice with wash buffer. Then 100&#x003bc;l of serially diluted C1q standard was pipetted to the first two columns of the microwell strips. To the remaining strips pre-diluted to 1:1000 plasma samples (100&#x003bc;l/well) were added and to the last two wells a blank (assay buffer) was added as a negative control. The plate was sealed and incubated at 22&#x000b0;C for 2hrs on a microplate shaker set at 400 revolutions per minute (rpm). After 2 hours incubation, the plate was washed 6 times with wash buffer and tapped on the absorbent pad. To each well, 100&#x003bc;l of biotin-conjugated anti-human C1q antibody was added and incubated at 22&#x000b0;C for 1hr on a microplate shaker set at 400rpm. Then the microplate was washed as described above and followed by the addition of 100&#x003bc;l Streptavidin-HRP to all wells. The plate was sealed and incubated at 22&#x000b0;C for 1hr on a microplate shaker as described.

The gene expression of C1q was also quantified in blood and skin biopsy samples of these patients before and after treatment. Patients with ENL had significantly lower circulating concentrations of C1q than LL controls before treatment. However, after treatment, the amount of circulating C1q was not significantly different in both groups. This is the first work to determine circulating C1q production using ELISA in leprosy patients in leprosy patients with and without ENL. Therefore, comparison with previous studies would not have been possible. one earlier qualitative study had reported that lower C1q binding activity in the sera of untreated ENL patients compared to treated ENL patients[<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The decreased frequency of circulating C1q in the sera of untreated patients with ENL compared to healthy controls as well as non reactional LL patient controls could be due to its utilisation by the antigen-antibody complex formation in ENL reaction. Similarly, a decreased serum complement C1q levels have been observed in other immune complex disorders such as acute glomerulonephritis (Lange et al., 1960, Lewis et al., 1971, Ohi and Tamano, 2001) and acute systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Baatrup et al., 1984, Grevink et al., 2005). However, since the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases like ENL reactions are different, further study is required.</p><p>The gene expression level of <italic>C1q A</italic>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic> in the blood and <italic>C1q A</italic>, and <italic>C</italic> in the skin biopsies from patients with ENL reactions were significantly higher than in LL controls before treatment. However, after treatment, none of these genes were found to be significantly different between the two groups. It is interesting to note that while the amount of circulating C1q protein is decreased in active ENL, its gene expression is increased in untreated ENL patients compared to the corresponding LL patient controls. This phenomenon may be explained by the utilization of C1q in immune-complex formation in active ENL patients. Although the initiation of ENL is not precisely known, several studies have reported the involvement of immune-complexes in the pathophysiology of ENL reaction. Immune-complexes activate the classical complement pathway that opsonise or coat antigen-antibody complexes with complement molecules which facilitates the clearance of immune-complexes by the macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hence, by maintaining immune-complexes in solution, the complements allow clearance of the complexes from their site of formation, minimizing local inflammatory consequences [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, in the event of immune-complexes deposition complements are consumed until [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In the comparison within ENL group, it has been found that C1qC gene expression was significantly increased in the skin biopsies of untreated ENL and subsequently decreased after ENL Treatment. The increased C1qC gene expiration in untreated active ENL may be associated with the immune activation in ENL reactions. Previously we have shown that increased T-cell activation in untreated active ENL patient compared to non-reactional LL controls [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It has also been reported that the inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6 increase C1q production by macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Several studies indicated that C1q can modulate dendritic cell maturation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and T- and B-cell responses in addition to its classical function to initiate complement activation [<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006321.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Therefore, in the same scenario, <italic>C1qC</italic> gene expression could be used as potential diagnostic marker for ENL, which necessities further investigation particularly in the lesions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0006321.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Britton</surname><given-names>W.J.</given-names></name> and <name><surname>Lockwood</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name>, <article-title>Leprosy</article-title>. <source>Lancet</source>
