Sea sickness and white finger due to ship movement and vibration respectively are two examples in this regard. Humidity in working area can also bring discomfort of the workers in humid area. Cheese processing factories are such places where there is high humidity in the working space.</p><p>Mental stress is a psychological complication which can arise due to some physical factors in certain occupational activities, therefore an attempt was made to have a search on mental stress in the laborers working in a cheese factory in Orumieheh, a city in north of Iran, with a cold climate throughout the year.</p><p>For the purpose of the present study, a cheese processing factory with 100 workers was selected. The workers were divided in to two groups. One group was exposed to high humidity and the other exposed to normal humidity level. A standard questionnaire was given to two groups to check the mental stress.</p><p>The results obtained from both groups were compared.. The result showed severe mental stress in workers exposed to high humidity whereas moderate stress level in other workers.</p><p>The conclusion of the present work is a proof of the adverse effect of humidity in working environments which reflect in mental stress in workers which will be discussed in detail in full paper.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cheese processing factory</kwd><kwd>humidity</kwd><kwd>mental stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Psychological complications are an inseparable part of industrial life..[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] Screening of these complications is important as far as social health is concerned.

On this basis, a research was planned out in one of the cheese processing factory with high humidity and relatively cold temperature, to look for the possibility of mental stress in laborers working in the factory.</p><p>It is beneficial to mention that there are no references available on the effect of the only humidity on psychological complications and that too mental stress in cheese processing factories where as there are large number of such factories in developed countries.

Percentage humidity (% HR) and temperature (&#x000b0;C) were recorded in different parts of the factory. The selection of the places where the measurements were done was according to site, the laborers used to work in the factory. Hygrometer, HD 100 was the instrument used for the purpose of present work.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>]</p><p>To test the mental behavior of the laborers, the factory was classified in two sections. The first section was the places in the factory where the laborers encountered with suitable humidity like the offices, laboratory and spaces outside the factory. The laborers in these areas were taken as control group. The second area was a place where high humidity above 60% was persistent. The laborers in these areas were taken as case group. One hundred laborers (60 and 40 as case and control group respectively) were selected from two sections. Selection was done in way that the laborers match in different aspects except humidity levels which was different. Questionnaire Lionel Coudron[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] was used to compare the psychological behavior i.e. mental stress in two groups.</p><p>The results obtained in two groups was compared and searched for the possible differences in two groups as far as the mental stress was concerned.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Certain factors in working areas can bring about psychological disturbances.
