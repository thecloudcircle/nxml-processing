To examine behavior of transfected plasmids, we analyzed their transcriptional landscape by deep sequencing. We have found that the entire plasmid sequence is transcribed at different levels. Spurious transcription may have undesirable effects as some plasmids, when co-transfected, inhibited expression of luciferase reporters in a dose-dependent manner. In one case, we attributed this effect to a Kan/Neo resistance cassette, which generated a unique population of edited sense and antisense small RNAs. The unexpected complexity of expression from transiently transfected plasmids underscores the importance of appropriate experimental controls.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (grant GACR 204/09/0085), institutional support AV0Z50520514 and RVO 68378050, and the European Molecular Biology Organization Strategic Development Installation Grant (program 0001488, partial).

However, transient plasmid transfections are often used without appropriate attention to potential artifacts. Several factors contribute to this situation. Ancestors of currently used reporter plasmids were developed one or two decades ago (firefly luciferase &#x02013;1987 <xref rid="pone.0043283-de1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase &#x02013;1996 <xref rid="pone.0043283-Lorenz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, green fluorescent protein &#x02013;1994 <xref rid="pone.0043283-Chalfie1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>) when available technologies limited detailed analysis of plasmid expression and its behavior in transfected cells. At the same time, it is difficult to find information about unexpected effects in transfection experiments in the literature. Seminal articles published more than a decade ago <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043283-Terenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> are cited rather infrequently and they are difficult to find among hundreds of irrelevant hits in literature database searches. In addition, the majority of common plasmids used in laboratories are commercial plasmids or their derivatives. Information about these plasmids is often restricted into company&#x02019;s technical notes (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0043283-Paguio1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043283-Schagat1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>) while peer-reviewed information about potential problems with these plasmids is limited or even absent.</p><p>Reports demonstrating false reporter response in transient transfections suggest three main sources of artifacts. First, reporter plasmids carry artificial cis-regulatory sequences, whose recognition by cellular proteins affects reporter expression at the transcription level <xref rid="pone.0043283-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043283-Vopalensky1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, recognition of artificial cis-regulatory sequences can be affected by experimental conditions, creating a false treatment response <xref rid="pone.0043283-Shifera1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The second source of problems can be lesions in transfected DNA <xref rid="pone.0043283-Sorscher1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The third source of possible artifacts are post-transcriptional regulations. They could involve, for example, expression of complementary RNAs <xref rid="pone.0043283-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> or activation of the protein kinase R (PKR) and the type I interferon (IFN) response <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kalvakolanu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043283-Terenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043283-Ghazawi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Upon activation by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), PKR blocks protein synthesis by phosphorylating the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2 (reviewed in detail in <xref rid="pone.0043283-Sinkkonen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). Taken together, an outcome of a transient transfection experiment can be biased in numerous ways. Yet, published results often include only a minimal set of controls and further details concerning the specificity, reproducibility, dynamic range of the assay <italic>etc</italic>. are not disclosed.</p><p>The presented work arose from an internal discussion in the lab regarding which plasmid DNA should be used to maintain a constant amount of transfected DNA per sample. In most cases, one can use a parental plasmid with the same backbone sequence. However, sometimes one needs to select a &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; DNA. We previously noticed that different co-transfected plasmids may influence each other. Therefore, we used deep sequencing to characterize transcriptomes of four common plasmids and we further tested sensitivity of luciferase reporters to co-transfection of a larger set of plasmids. We show here that 1) transfected plasmids are a rich source of spurious RNA transcription, 2) pEGFP and its derivatives carrying the same Kan/Neo backbone have strong negative effects on luciferase activity when compared to pBluescript (pBS), and 3) the most likely cause of luciferase reporter inhibition is dsRNA originating from co-transfected plasmids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The following plasmids were used in this study: pBluescript II KS (+) (Stratagene), pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), phRL-SV40 (Promega), pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), pJET (Fermentas), pLMP (Open Biosystems), pTMP (Open Biosystems), pSUPER (OligoEngine), pTER <xref rid="pone.0043283-vandeWetering1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and pCAG-EGFP <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kaname1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. pGL4-SV40 plasmid was produced by moving SV40 promoter from phRL-SV40 into pGL4.10 (Promega) backbone using BglII-HindIII restriction sites. pRFP-T expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) was constructed by replacing the EGFP coding sequence in pEGFP-C1 by PCR-amplified monomeric TagRFP sequence (Evrogen) using NheI-BglII restriction sites. pCI-RFPT was constructed by a similar strategy by inserting the TagRFP sequence into the multiple cloning site of the pCI-Neo. To obtain pEGFP_Amp and pRFP_Amp, the kanamycin cassettes (flanked by BspHI restriction sites) in pEGFP-C1 and pRFP-T were replaced by BspHI-released &#x003b2;-lactamase sequence from pCAG-EGFP. Modified plasmids were verified by restriction digest and sequencing.</p><fig id="pone-0043283-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043283.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SOLiD sequencing of total RNAs derived from transfected plasmids.</title><p>Each graph shows the read density along each of the studied plasmids in sense (above X-axis) and antisense (below X-axis) directions.

The origin and fate of the spurious transcripts remain unknown. While the pattern of read densities would suggest multiple transcription start sites, distribution of reads along reporter mRNAs indicates that the read distribution is also biased by the deep sequencing procedure. Thus, one cannot unequivocally determine transcription start sites. Likewise, termination of the anomalous transcription could not be precisely determined. Analyses of 3&#x02032; oligoadenylated sequence tags did not provide conclusive evidence that putative polyadenylation signal sequences are functional. On the other hand, polyadenylation following canonical AAUAAA polyadenylation sites of reporter transcripts was readily detected (data not shown). Expression patterns were typically reproducible for the same sequences. For example, Amp<sup>r</sup> region yielded RNAs mostly in the antisense orientation relative to the &#x003b2;-lactamase coding sequence and read density along the Amp<sup>r</sup> or pUC sequences in phRL-SV40 and pBS yielded similar patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g002">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>).

We co-transfected ten different plasmids from our plasmid collection with firefly (pGL4-SV40) and <italic>Renilla</italic> (phRL-SV40) luciferases reporters. Tested plasmids represented a diverse set of plasmids used for cloning (pBS, pCR2.1, pJET), as reporters (pCAG-EGFP, pEGFP-C1, pRFP-T), or for RNAi (pLMP, pTMP, pTER and pSUPER). This experiment revealed that majority of plasmids (except for pLMP) inhibited luciferases when compared to pBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Notably, both luciferases were similarly affected suggesting a common mechanism affecting plasmid-derived reporter expression. The strongest repression of luciferase reporters was observed in co-transfection with pEGFP-C1 and pRFP-T plasmids carrying the Kan/Neo resistance gene. The inhibitory effect of pEGFP-C1 and pRFP-T was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and was not restricted to luciferase reporters because pCI-RFPT-dependent red fluorescence was also inhibited by co-transfected pEGFP-C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g003">Fig. 3C and S</xref>1).</p><p>Reduction of luciferase activities was apparently not due to cellular toxicity (no reduced growth or increased cell mortality were observed (Fig. S2)). Since pRFP-T exerted the same inhibitory effect as pEGFP-C1, we hypothesized that the inhibition is mediated by the plasmid backbone, which is common for both plasmids, and not by EGFP sequence or its expression. To get further insights into possible causes of inhibitory effects of pEGFP-C1, we re-examined deep sequencing data searching for any transcriptome features unique to pEGFP-C1. The analysis included size distribution of RNA fragments and frequency of A/G conversion (which is a hallmark of edited dsRNA <xref rid="pone.0043283-Nejepinska1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). Consistently with our previous analysis of small RNAs derived from long dsRNA, we have identified a population of RNAs carrying A/G conversions residing within the Kan/Neo cassette of pEGFP-C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). While RNAs carrying A/G conversion were occasionally found elsewhere, none of the other plasmids produced a similar cluster of edited RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g004">Fig. 4A, 4B</xref>). Since the Kan/Neo cassette is also a region with a prominent presence of overlapping sense and antisense transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), we conclude that the Kan/Neo cassette generates dsRNA.</p><p>To test if the presence of the Kan/Neo cassette is necessary for the inhibitory effect of pEGFP-C1 and pRFP-T on co-transfected plasmids, we replaced the Kan/Neo resistance in pEGFP-C1 and pRFP-T with ampicillin resistance (placed in the same orientation as Kan/Neo). Co-transfection with pGL4-SV40 and phRL-SV40 luciferase reporters showed that the presence of the kanamycin resistance cassette in pEGFP-C1 and pRFP-T plasmids is associated with the reporter inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In the case of pRFP-T, exchange of resistance completely abolished the inhibitory effect while there was a residual inhibition observed in the case of pEGFP-C1. This suggests that other factors also contribute to the inhibition by pEGFP-C1 in co-transfection experiments. The relief of repression upon the replacement of the kanamycin cassette was not due to a lower transfection efficiency of ampicillin-bearing plasmids since the number of RFP or EGFP-positive cells remained the same upon resistance exchange (data not shown). Because expression of fluorescent proteins could contribute to inhibitory effects, we analyzed EGFP and RFP fluorescence produced by pEGFP-C1, pEGFP_Amp, pRFP-T, and pRFPT_Amp. Remarkably, cells transfected with pEGFP_Amp exhibited lower EGFP fluorescence while RFP fluorescence of pRFP_Amp was the same as of pRFP-T (Fig. S3). Thus, neither different transfection efficiency nor different expression of a fluorescent protein explains the relief of inhibition when the Kan/Neo resistance is replaced with the ampicillin resistance in pRFP. We propose a model where RNA transcribed from the Kan/Neo sequence in pEGFP-C1 (and likely in other plasmids utilizing the same backbone) inhibits expression of co-transfected plasmids in a process likely involving the formation of dsRNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We provide the first deep sequencing-based mapping of transcriptional landscapes of transiently transfected plasmids. Although the level of spurious transcription can be estimated only indirectly, it is clear that it reaches significant levels since read density of spurious transcripts is within the same order of magnitude as that of transcripts produced by annotated eukaryotic genes. Co-transfection experiments suggest that spurious transcription effects depend more on the origin of spurious transcription rather than its level. While pBS and pEGFP-C1 yield comparable levels of spurious transcription, their effects on co-transfected plasmids are in a stark contrast. We cannot rule out that overexpressed CDS in a co-transfected plasmid may also exert inhibitory effects, perhaps related to translational factors consumption. However, the analysis of RFP expression in cells transfected with pRFP-T and pRFP_Amp suggests that a presence of an overexpressed CDS is not the main cause of inhibitory effects on co-transfected luciferase reporters (Figs. S1C and 4C).</p><p>The mechanism by which spurious transcription exerts its effect on co-transfected plasmids is unclear at the moment. We ruled out toxic effects on cells or global repression of translation. Some evidence suggests that dsRNA expression triggers the inhibition. First, the Kan/Neo cassette, which is implicated in the inhibition, is the main locus where we observe significant amount of overlapping sense and antisense transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Second, small RNAs carrying A/G conversions cluster in the Kan/Neo cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043283-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Three lines of evidence suggest that observed A/G conversion is due to the activity of adenosine deamination of dsRNA. First, 21&#x02013;26 nt-long reads mapping to pEGFP-C1 have the highest A/G nucleotide change rate among all plasmids and among all possible nucleotide changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043283.s005">Table S2</xref>). Second, the editing should result in more frequent appearance of repeated A/G conversions in a single read when compared to random nucleotide changes, which would presumably occur independently of each other in one read. Indeed, A/G conversion was the most frequent repeated nucleotide change in single reads (&#x0003e;80% of all of them) and was mostly found in 21&#x02013;26 nt-long reads mapping to pEGFP-C1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043283.s006">Table S3</xref>). Third, similar small RNAs were found to be derived from a long RNA hairpin but not single-stranded RNA <xref rid="pone.0043283-Nejepinska1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that our deep sequencing of total RNA does not allow for a good quantitative estimate of the abundance of plasmid-derived small RNAs relative to endogenous mRNAs. While a library preparation causes variable biases <xref rid="pone.0043283-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we also cannot distinguish, which short tags (&#x0003c;30 nt) existed as small RNAs in cells and which were produced during the library preparation. Also, knowing frequencies of reads matching endogenous miRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043283-t001">Table 1C</xref>) does not alleviate the problem since they have a unique origin and their quantitative analysis by deep sequencing is also problematic <xref rid="pone.0043283-Linsen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, miRNA data may provide an insight into the composition of our deep sequencing libraries but cannot serve as a precise reference point to estimate the abundance of other classes of small RNAs.</p><p>dsRNA can induce sequence-specific RNA interference (RNAi) effect. In fact, a study of integrated plasmid repeats in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells revealed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced from long dsRNA precursors originating from plasmid sequences <xref rid="pone.0043283-Hartig1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We cannot formally exclude RNA silencing because the effect was not directly tested in cells devoid of Dicer. However, it is unlikely that the inhibition of co-transfected reporters involves RNA silencing. First, our previous study of long dsRNA fate in cultured mammalian cells suggests that long dsRNA does not efficiently enter RNAi there <xref rid="pone.0043283-Nejepinska1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Second, RNAi targets homologous sequences, thus Kan/Neo derived siRNAs could not explain down-regulation of luciferase reporters. Third, a miRNA-like inhibition of luciferase reporters by Kan/Neo-derived siRNAs (i.e. with a less extensive homology), is also unlikely because a large portion of the endogenous gene expression should be strongly affected as well.</p><p>It has been reported previously that expression from non-viral and viral vectors is suppressed in mammalian cells in a PKR-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0043283-Terenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, while plasmid expression was negatively influenced by the presence of PKR, translation of endogenous proteins was not strongly affected <xref rid="pone.0043283-Terenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. PKR and dsRNA were also implicated in the selective inhibition of transfected genes in the past <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kalvakolanu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kaufman2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Notably, negative effects of pEGFP-C1 co-transfection are similar to effects of long dsRNA expression in co-transfection experiments (our unpublished observation). At the same time, we have reported that long dsRNA expression has a negligible impact on expression of the genome and does not provoke robust PKR phosphorylation nor the typical type I IFN response to dsRNA <xref rid="pone.0043283-Nejepinska1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that pEGFP-C1-induced repression of co-transfected luciferase reporters involves PKR-mediated selective inhibition of luciferase expression, which is induced by dsRNA produced by spurious transcription from the Kan/Neo cassette.</p><p>Our work has important implications for transient transfection experiments. First, control experiments must be performed to test how different ratios of co-transfected plasmids influence the outcome. Second, experiments should be designed such that they would not require adding of any extra DNA to equalize the amount of transfected DNA. If extra DNA needs to be added, a parental plasmid lacking the &#x0201c;experimental factor&#x0201d; would be the most reasonable choice as it would neutralize the effect caused by the plasmid backbone. However, if one needs a to add a different &#x0201c;neutral DNA&#x0201d;, we recommend using pBS, which has a very common backbone carrying pUC ori and resistance to ampicillin. Third, when combining luciferase and EGFP reporters in one experiment, we recommend avoiding plasmids with the Kan/Neo resistance backbone related to that of pEGFP-C1. Fourth, since several experiments suggest that integrated reporters are insensitive to effects observed during transient transfection <xref rid="pone.0043283-Kaufman2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043283-Nejepinska1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, a production of stable cell lines should be considered as an alternative or a complementary approach to transient transfections whenever possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043283.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>

<bold>Transfection with pEGFP-C1 or pRFP-T plasmid does not have toxic effects on transfected cells. (A)</bold> Percentage of dead (Hoechst 33258-positive) cells after transfection with different plasmids. HEK-293 cells in a 24-well plate were transfected either with pEGFP-C1 or pRFP-T plasmid (150 ng per well, pBluescript was added to 500 ng per well) or pBluescript (500 ng per well). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the incorporation of Hoechst 33258 dye to visualize dead cells 48 hours post-transfection. Cells treated with Puromycin served as a positive control for Hoechst 33258 staining. There was no increase in a percentage of dead cells in cells transfected either with pEGFP-C1 or pRFP-T plasmids (tested plasmids) compared to Bluescript (pBS)-transfected or untransfected cells. <bold>(B)</bold> Relative protein amount in lysates of transfected cells is not significantly affected by different amounts of EGFP and RFP-expressing plasmids. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of each phRL-SV40 and pGL4-SV40 reporter plasmids and an increasing amount of indicated plasmid (nanograms of plasmid per well are indicated in parentheses). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding pBS. After 48 hours, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in the Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Total protein amount in lysates was estimated by Bradford Protein assay (Bio-Rad). Data show a result of a representative experiment performed in quadruplicates.
