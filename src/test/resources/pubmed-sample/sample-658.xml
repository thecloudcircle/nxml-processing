In the United States, a reported 3-month prevalence of back pain was 30.7%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and estimated direct and indirect costs were $90.7 billion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and $19.8 billion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], respectively. The cause of back pain is multifactorial; however, intervertebral disc degeneration is associated with back pain, as shown by the observation that UK women with advanced disc degeneration have 3.2 higher odds of manifesting low back pain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The intervertebral disc has a complex structure with the nucleus pulposus (NP) encapsulated by the end plates and the annulus fibrosus (AF). Whereas the AF arises from the mesenchyme
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the NP originates from the notochord
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Notochordal cells exist during only approximately the first 10&#x000a0;years of human life, and are then replaced by non-notochordal, chondrocyte-like cells of unknown provenance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Intervertebral disc degeneration is characterized by extracellular matrix degradation and decreased cellularity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Morphologic and biochemical evidence suggests that the disc degenerates starting from early childhood
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and these changes are generally more severe in the NP than in the AF
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the NP, obvious clefts and radial tears can occur in ages 11 through 16&#x000a0;years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Aggrecan biosynthesis and type 2 procollagen content are highest in ages 5&#x000a0;years and younger and diminish by 5 to 15&#x000a0;years, and denatured type 2 collagen percentage is lowest in ages 5&#x000a0;years and younger and increases thereafter
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Programmed cell death, apoptosis, also increases substantially in ages 11 to 16&#x000a0;years, associated with notochordal cell disappearance and chondrocyte proliferation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These lines of evidence suggest a possible link between the loss of notochordal cells and the pathogenesis of disc degeneration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Apoptosis acts as a quality control mechanism for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by eliminating defective cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Cells undergo apoptosis through two major pathways: the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The death receptor pathway is initiated by apoptotic stimuli comprising extrinsic signals such as the binding of death-inducing ligands (for example, Fas ligand (FasL)), to cell surface receptors (for example, Fas). This complex activates initiator caspases, primarily caspase-8, followed by direct or indirect (via the mitochondrial signaling loop) activation of effector caspases, predominantly caspase-3. The mitochondrial pathway is initiated by intrinsic signals (for example, DNA damage), induced by diverse apoptotic stimuli, which converge at the mitochondria. DNA damage acetylates p53, which is deacetylated by the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. DNA damage phosphorylates p53 by dissociation of the complex of p53 and its negative regulators, murine double minutes 2 and 4
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. On severe DNA damage, serine 46 on p53 is phosphorylated, and p53-dependent apoptosis is induced&#x02014;only when p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1 (p53AIP1) is expressed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. p53AIP1 is a pivotal mediator of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, interacting with B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Imbalanced Bcl-2 family members, such as pro apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death, and BH3-interacting domain death agonist and antiapoptotic Bcl-2, induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release, and initiator caspase-9 activation, followed by effector caspase-3 activation, resulting in apoptosis.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic illustration summarizing apoptotic signaling through the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway.</bold> The death receptor pathway is initiated by extrinsic signals such as the binding of death-inducing ligands (for example, Fas ligand (FasL)), to cell-surface receptors (for example, Fas). This complex cleaves the pro-form of initiator caspase-8, followed by direct or indirect (via the mitochondrial signaling loop) cleavage of the pro-form of effector caspase-3. The mitochondrial pathway is initiated by intrinsic signals (for example, DNA damage). DNA damage acetylates p53, which is deacetylated by the silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1). DNA damage phosphorylates p53 by dissociation of the complex of p53 and its negative regulators, murine double minutes 2 (Mdm2) and 4 (Mdm4). The p53 phosphorylation at serine 46 induces p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1 (p53AIP1) expression. p53AIP1 interacts with B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Imbalanced Bcl-2 family members (such as proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death (Bad), and BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) and antiapoptotic Bcl-2), induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release, and cleavage of the pro-form of initiator caspase-9 followed by caspase-3 cleavage, resulting in apoptosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ar4460-1"/></fig><p>A high incidence of apoptotic cells is observed in human aged and degenerated discs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the progression of apoptosis and its practical significance in intervertebral disc degeneration still remain unclear.</p><p>Systematic analysis of the disc degeneration mechanism by using human specimens is difficult because of its diverse etiologies, such as mechanical stress, injury, inflammation, smoking, nutrient loss, and aging
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; therefore, reliable animal models of disc degeneration are required. Rodents retain notochordal cells in the NP throughout their lifetime
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although this limits relevance to the human condition, studies using rodent models have provided considerable insights into the notochordal cell-related pathogenesis of disc degeneration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>We previously reported a rat tail model of disc degeneration induced by a common induction method&#x02014;mechanical loading&#x02014;which mimics extracellular matrix metabolic imbalances in human disc degeneration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The observed imbalances of degradative enzymes and their inhibitors and the net effect on aggrecanolysis under sustained static compression are consistent with human evidence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This similarity with the human condition conveys the primary advantage of static compression for longitudinal investigation of disc degeneration.</p><p>Static compression decreases disc cell numbers, simulating human degeneration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The primary question in this study was why disc cells decline in number under static compression despite limited trauma to the disc
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], unlike annular puncture
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The mechanism of static compression-induced decreased cellularity has been partially explained by increased apoptosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] through the mitochondrial pathway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, the long-term aspects of apoptotic signaling and the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins throughout the degenerative process have not been studied. The role of notochordal cell disappearance in this process has also remained undetermined. Therefore, we undertook an <italic>in vivo</italic> approach by using the rat tail static compression-induced disc degeneration model to elucidate the time-dependent notochordal cell disappearance and apoptotic cell death.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal procedures were performed under the approval and guidance of the Animal Care and Use Committee at Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine.</p><sec><title>Animals and surgical procedure</title><p>In total, 24 12-week-old male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan), ranging in weight from 452&#x000a0;g to 509&#x000a0;g, were used.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Rat tails were affixed with an Ilizarov-type apparatus with springs, a type similar to that of Iatridis and colleagues
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], between the caudal (C) vertebrae 8 and 10, as described in our previous articles (Figure&#x000a0;

In brief, two-cross 0.7-mm diameter Kirschner wires were inserted percutaneously into each vertebral body perpendicular to the tail&#x02019;s axis and attached to aluminum rings. Rings were connected longitudinally with four threaded rods. Four 0.50-N/mm calibrated springs were installed over each rod. After instrumentation, axial force was applied from the distal side to produce a calculated compressive stress of 1.3&#x000a0;MPa. This stress, corresponding closely to transient disc loading force produced by lifting a moderate weight in the human lumbar spine, is shown to induce morphologic and biochemical disc degeneration

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the rodent tail model by Lotz and colleagues
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], static compression initiates apoptotic cell death in the inner AF, cartilage endplates, and then NP, which is worsened by increases in the magnitude (up to 1.3&#x000a0;MPa) and duration (up to 7&#x000a0;days) of loading. Furthermore, in the inner AF, static compression at 1.3&#x000a0;MPa for 24&#x000a0;hours induces increased reactivity for TUNEL and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> but not for FasL, indicating apoptosis induction primarily through the mitochondrial pathway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, these are the short-term effects. Few studies have explored the long-term changes in cell population and phenotype. Our rat tail model of disc degeneration induced by sustained static compression at 1.3&#x000a0;MPa for up to 56&#x000a0;days reproduces progressive radiographic disc height loss (&#x0003e;70%), lower T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disc intensity, histologic degeneration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and extracellular matrix degradation with modified expression of catabolic enzymes and anticatabolic proteins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the current study, by using this model, we investigated the long-term progression of notochordal cell disappearance and apoptotic cell death in the disc. Furthermore, we studied time-dependent apoptotic signaling through the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway. This study elucidates the likely mechanisms behind decreased cellularity in static compression-induced disc degeneration.</p><p>Histomorphologic and immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated decreased disc NP and AF cells with compression. Eventually at day 56, only &#x0003c;50% of cells remained both in the NP and AF. Particularly, the decrease was notable at day 7 in NP cells with a notochordal phenotype&#x02014;cytokeratin-8<sup>+</sup> galectin-3<sup>+</sup>. This finding is consistent with the rabbit lumbar compression model study by Guehring and colleagues
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], showing more rapid reduction of cytokeratin-8<sup>+</sup> cells than total NP cells by mechanical compression. Their study suggested increased sclerosis and fibrosis in the endplates, leading to the loss of nutrient supply, which could explain why notochordal cells decrease in number and lose their phenotype in compressive stress-induced disc degeneration. In addition, an MRI study using a contrast agent implied impairment of diffusion of nutrients from the periphery through the endplates with sustained mechanical loading
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, the static compression model may be associated with nutrient deprivation. Notochordal cells require a higher amount of energy to survive and are more vulnerable to nutrient deprivation than do non-notochordal, chondrocyte-like cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, notochordal cells appear to be less resistant to mechanical loading and related nutrient deprivation than do non-notochordal cells. However, how these stresses affect notochordal cells and reduce their numbers was largely unknown. Hence, we next examined the apoptosis of notochordal cells.</p><p>TUNEL staining and immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 demonstrated increased involvement of apoptosis with compression, which concurs with human
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and other static compression studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Then, immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved caspase-9 showed transient activation of death receptor signaling and persistent activation of mitochondrial signaling in static compression-induced apoptosis. Caspase-dependent apoptosis requires proteolytic cleavage; therefore, the presence of cleaved caspases indicates activated apoptosis through their own pathways
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the context of the mouse model study by Rannou and colleagues
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] describing increased mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release but not death ligand, FasL, expression in the AF under 24-hour static compression, our longitudinal, longer-term observation of caspase cleavage products provides more direct evidence regarding the involved apoptotic pathways during disc degeneration. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for p53AIP1 exhibited that the observed mitochondrial apoptosis was consistently mediated by p53 signaling. p53AIP1 expression itself indicates induction of p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although few studies have reported p53AIP1 induction in the disc, a human chondrocyte study showed highly expressed p53AIP1 in osteoarthritic cartilage and increased p53AIP1 expression by shear strain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Taken together, the present results indicate that apoptosis is involved in static compression-induced disc degeneration, which is induced by a combination of signals through the death receptor pathway and more dominantly through the p53-mediated mitochondrial pathway.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2 and SIRT1 demonstrated that expression of these antiapoptotic proteins decreased with compression, which also concurs with reported evidence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Overexpression of Bcl-2 limits disc cell apoptosis and messenger RNA downregulation of <italic>aggrecan</italic> and <italic>collagen type 2</italic> under serum starvation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. SIRT1 activation by resveratrol inhibits nitric oxide-induced mitochondrial apoptosis in chondrocytes, showing decreased Bax and increased Bcl-2
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Overexpression of SIRT1 suppresses catabolic gene upregulation induced by interleukin-1&#x003b2;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, the consistently decreased Bcl-2 and SIRT1 expression may contribute to the acceleration of apoptotic cell death in static compression-induced disc degeneration.</p><p>The cell decrease in this rat tail model is summarized in Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Although the majority of cells with a notochordal phenotype disappeared at day 7, the proportion of apoptotic cells without notochordal phenotype substantially increased. This raises two questions. The first question is how notochordal cells are actually lost&#x02014;cell death or phenotypic loss? A tamoxifen-inducible <italic>ShhcreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> mouse study showed that the entire NP cell population, even in the adult, descends from the notochord
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In a mouse disc injury model, annular puncture induces transformation of the notochordal NP into a chondrogenic and subsequently fibrocartilaginous phenotype
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our cell count data, which showed a transient increase in non-notochordal NP cells, may also indicate a phenotypic change with differentiation of notochordal into non-notochordal cells by mechanical stress.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic illustration summarizing static compression-induced notochordal cell disappearance and apoptotic cell death in the intervertebral disc.</bold> The number of disc nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) cells decreases with compression; particularly, the decrease is notable in larger, vacuolated cells with a notochordal phenotype, cytokeratin-8<sup>+</sup> galectin-3<sup>+</sup>. Subsequently, the proportion of apoptotic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3-positive cells increases throughout. This apoptosis induction is mediated transiently through the death receptor pathway, as determined by immunopositivity for cleaved caspase-8, and persistently through the p53-dependent mitochondrial pathway, as identified by immunopositivity for cleaved caspase-9 and p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1 (p53AIP1). The percentage of cells expressing antiapoptotic proteins, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), decreases consistently. The increased proapoptotic and decreased antiapoptotic proteins are an indication of static compression-induced disc cell death and degeneration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ar4460-7"/></fig><p>Somewhat inconsistent TUNEL and immunohistochemical staining results were seen in the NP at day 0. Although TUNEL-positivity was lower, immunoreactivity for apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins was stronger and immunopositivity for cleaved caspases and Bcl-2 was higher. The higher positivity for cleaved caspases versus TUNEL is similar to the higher positivity for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> versus TUNEL in the mouse-model study by Rannou and colleagues
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A previous comparative study of apoptosis detection methods concluded that immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase-3 is a more sensitive and reliable method for detecting and quantifying apoptosis than is TUNEL staining
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. That study showed that positivity for cleaved caspase-3 was approximately threefold higher than that for TUNEL staining but was close to that for morphologically identified apoptotic cells. Therefore, our findings potentially indicate high baseline levels of apoptotic signals in notochordal cells, suggesting a preapoptotic state. Our 56-day observation did not detect additional increase in apoptosis of notochordal cells in unloaded control discs. Longer-term studies may be required to investigate age-related increases in the apoptosis, as notochordal cell disappearance was reported previously in a &#x0003e;2-year rabbit study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In addition, the decrease in Bcl-2 expression was more pronounced between days 0 and 7, suggesting an important role of Bcl-2 in notochordal cell homeostasis. Thus, our findings lend support to the view that notochordal cell disappearance is associated with apoptosis. However, no direct evidence exists regarding whether the possible phenotypic transition from notochordal to non-notochordal is associated with apoptotic signaling. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of notochordal cell disappearance.</p><p>The second question concerns with the causative roles of notochordal cell disappearance and increased apoptosis of non-notochordal cells in intervertebral disc degeneration. The observed finding at day 7 raises the possibility that cell death during disc degeneration is driven by non-notochordal cells, whereas the loss of notochordal cells is coincidental. Discs of some species (for example, bovine, ovine, and equine) lose notochordal cells before or rapidly after birth; however, their discs show few signs of degenerative changes, even in adulthood
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This indicates that the loss of notochordal cells is not always an indication of disc degeneration. It is still controversial whether the loss of notochordal cells is a part of species-specific development or of the degenerative process in the human disc. <italic>In vitro</italic>, notochordal cell-conditioned medium protects non-notochordal cells from FasL-mediated apoptosis and interleukin-1&#x003b2;-mediated inflammation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In addition, notochordal cells produce a larger amount of proteoglycans than do non-notochordal cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and stimulate non-notochordal cells to produce proteoglycans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Taken together with the susceptibility of notochordal cells by mechanical
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and nutritional
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] stress, notochordal cells potentially lead to altering their phenotype and/or cell death under static compression, whereas non-notochordal cells may be actively involved in subsequent disc degeneration. This rat tail static compression model mimics notochordal cell disappearance and apoptotic cell death in human intervertebral disc aging and degeneration.</p><p>A major limitation of the study is that the static-compression model simulates nonphysiological conditions: immobility, extended pressure, and absence of trauma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Lower levels of inflammation in this model, as shown previously
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], may relate to less involvement of apoptosis through the death receptor pathway. Another limitation is that the results of the staining assays are not completely quantitative. Our analysis of apoptotic signaling was limited to immunohistochemistry because it was difficult to collect sufficient protein extracts for Western blotting from severely degenerated discs. In addition, this study does not probe all apoptotic pathways. For example, Bcl-2 family members can function to activate caspase-12, inducing endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The specificity of cytokeratin-8 and galectin-3 as exclusive notochordal cell markers is not certain. In the current study, although 67.4% of cells co-immunopositive for cytokeratin-8 and galectin-3 with stronger immunoreactivity were observed in the NP at day 0, 34.0% of double-immunopositive cells were detected in the AF as well. This is consistent with Western blot results reported by Oguz and colleagues
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] showing that galectin-3 expression is highest in the rat NP, but AF and cartilage tissues also express galectin-3. In addition, microarray studies found that adult bovine and human NP tissues still express cytokeratin-8
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Cells positive for cytokeratins and galectin-3 are present in a considerable fraction of adult human lumbar discs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], raising the question whether notochordal cells are truly lost in the disc during postnatal life. Cytokeratin-8 and galectin-3 are useful markers; however, they are by no means exclusively specific for notochordal cells. The establishment of more specific notochordal cell markers is required as still no definitive markers of notochordal cells are known
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>This study describes the predominance of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis over the death receptor pathway during disc degeneration. An <italic>in vivo</italic> study using a rabbit annular puncture model demonstrated that knockdown of caspase-3 by small interference RNA results in delayed disc degeneration
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. However, caspase inhibition has shown induction of alternative cell death-related programs, including necrosis, autophagy, and senescence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Taken together, overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins through the mitochondrial pathway (for example, Bcl-2) may represent a specific, effective molecular treatment option in degenerative disc disease. Future mechanistic studies must be conducted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This rat tail static compression model mimics notochordal cell disappearance and apoptotic cell death in human intervertebral disc aging and degeneration. In early degenerative stages, the number of disc cells, particularly cells with a notochordal phenotype, drastically decreases, whereas the proportion of apoptotic cells increases.

This apoptosis induction is mediated transiently through the death receptor pathway and persistently through the p53-dependent mitochondrial pathway.
