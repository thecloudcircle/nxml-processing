OA is the most common joint disorder in the elderly. Its incidence has been rising steadily and is expected to escalate further with the projected world-wide increase in the aging population, impacting on the existing socio-economic burden (Arden and Nevitt, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Nearly 50 million Americans are already afflicted with OA, with 50% of the individuals affected being more than 65 years of age (Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC), <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). By 2030, it is estimated that about 20% of the European and American populations will suffer from OA (De Bari et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In the same period in the Middle East, the indicators of aging, namely the standardized prospective median age and the average age of the population are projected to increase from 20.9 and 26.0 in 2010 to 23.5 and 31.4 (Lutz et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Furthermore, the cultural prayer position and increased obesity in the Middle Eastern population pose additional risks for the development of OA in the aging population.</p><p>OA is characterized by progressive joint degeneration, pain, effusion and limitation of mobility with eventual loss of function (Buckwalter and Lane, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The entire articulating joint together with its constituent peri-articular tissues including bone, ligaments, joint capsule and synovium and are involved in the progression of OA, highlighting the complex nature of this disease (Loeser et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Although multiple factors are implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of OA, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the development of OA including age-related &#x0201c;wear and tear,&#x0201d; chondrocytes' poor response to growth factors, increased sensitivity to pro-inflammatory stimuli, excessive cross-linking and structural modification of collagens leading to alterations in the bio-mechanical properties of articular cartilage, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and low-level inflammation (Mobasheri et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Fundamentally, the number of chondrocytes in articular cartilage decreases with age resulting in impaired extracellular matrix repair and reduced production of new matrix proteins. In addition the absence of blood vessels and stem cells within the cartilage limits the natural healing capacity (Henrotin and Reginster, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Mobasheri et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) although evidence suggests that innervation and vascularization increases in the late stages of disease progression.</p><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, topical formulations, intra-articular injections and nutraceuticals are all used in OA treatment, but they are largely symptom modifying agents and there is little evidence to suggest that any of them have the capacity to act as disease modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs). Pharmacological management with DMOADs may relieve pain to some degree, but does not offer any structure modification (Reid et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Various surgical methods have been developed to restore damaged cartilage and improve joint function. These include microfracture, subchondral drilling, abrasion arthroplasty and autologus chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The aim of these techniques is to promote intrinsic healing by promoting vascular invasion, fibrin clot formation and recruitment of stem cells (Brittberg et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Vinatier et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Orth et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, the poor biomechanical properties of the new scar tissue in microfracture, as well as donor site morbidity, low cellularity and surrounding cartilage damage at the transplantation site in ACI limit their clinical utility and surgical outcomes (Brittberg et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Vinatier et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Orth et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). When pharmacological and surgical management fail, which is so often the case in the clinical setting, the disease progresses to end stage OA, where total joint replacement becomes the only option. However, the life span of currently available prostheses is limited and there is increasing demand for safer and more effective surgical treatments and therapeutic strategies (Kurtz et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Regenerative medicine offers great potential for therapeutic intervention in OA and could provide an excellent alternative to total joint replacement. The use of autologus matrix induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) in OA (Gille et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and intra-articular injection of meniscal stem/progenitors cells (Shen et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) are some recent advances in this area. Autologus and allogeneic stem cells derived from various sources (<italic>viz</italic>. bone marrow, synovium, adipose tissue etc.) have been used for treatment of OA with variable success (Garcia-Alvarez et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mobasheri et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These are either directly injected into the damaged site or differentiated into cartilage together with tissue engineered scaffolds or following treatment with growth factors.</p><p>The introduction of biological agents such as stem cells into the joint normally requires arthroscopic techniques. Temperature increases of 52.0 and 49.5&#x000b0;C following monopolar and bioplar radiofrequency application with irrigation have been reported during wrist arthroscopy in cadaveric models (Huber et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Animal studies have demonstrated ultrastructural changes in the size and cross-sectional diameter of the joint capsular collagen fibrils ranging from 22.5 to 50.4% following increased temperatures of 45 and 85&#x000b0;C (Lopez et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Bone drilling, a common treatment for operative fracture also generates heat and temperatures above 47&#x000b0;C are known to cause osteonecrosis (Augustin et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of temperature changes associated with arthroscopic procedures on cellular activity and/or survival in suspension and pellet cultures of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs), which are increasingly studied as a promising cell source for cartilage regeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Derivation and propagation of hBMMSCs</title><p>Bone marrow aspirates were harvested from the iliac crest of OA patients undergoing surgical treatment in the Department of Orthopedics, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Prior to sample collection informed patient consent was obtained and the research study was carried out following Institutional Research Ethics Committee approval [11&#x02013;557]. hBMMSCs were isolated using earlier published protocols (Brady et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Briefly, the bone marrow aspirate (5&#x02013;6 ml) was collected in heparinized tubes (Becton Dickinson, BD) and directly plated into tissue culture flasks (~2 ml of aspirate/T175 cm<sup>2</sup> flask; Greiner) and cultured using Dulbeccos's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mM Gluta-Max (Life Technologies) and antibiotic solution (penicillin, 100 u/mL; streptomycin 100 &#x003bc;g/mL - Sigma) under standard culture conditions of 37&#x000b0;C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in atmospheric air for 5&#x02013;7 days. The first media change was carried out on day 5 and subsequently every 2 or 3 days until subculture. Dead/suspended cells and cellular debris were washed away with media changes and the hBMMSCs were retained as a consequence of their plastic adherence. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Peprotech) at 5 ng/mL was added to the culture medium to facilitate hBMMSCs expansion and early passages of the derived hBMMSCs (&#x0003c; P5) were used in the experiment Expanded cells were frozen using ProFreeze (Lonza) in liquid nitrogen and stored for subsequent use.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of arthroscope temperature on cell morphology and metabolic activity</title><p>Baseline characterization included assessment of cell morphology and survival. The hBMMSCs were seeded in 24 well tissue culture plates at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. Cell morphology and their metabolic activity were analyzed using phase contrast microscopy and MTT assay respectively. To study the effect of temperature related changes that may result with use of the arthroscope in a clinical setting hBMMSCs (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were used either as cell suspensions or cell pellets. The arthroscope was sterilized and suspended vertically down using a stand with fixed clamp and placed within the biosafety cabinet. The suspension height of the arthroscope from the clamp was kept constant and the illuminated end was placed into the medium (10 mL) containing cell suspensions or cell pellets in 50 mL graduated Falcon tubes. The samples from both cell suspension and cell pellet groups were exposed for 10 min (Group A), 20 min (Group B), or 30 min (Group C). The cell suspensions and pellets were then gently mixed and 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well were seeded in a 24 well plate and cultured under standard culture conditions of 37&#x000b0;C in 5% atmospheric air for 72 h and both cell morphology and metabolic activity were assessed.</p><p>Cellular activity assays were also performed on cells from all the groups using the MTT kit (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma). Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;L MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL) was added to cultures, incubated for 4 h followed by medium removal and addition of 200 &#x003bc;L solubilization reagent. Culture plates were further incubated for 2 h and absorbance at 570 nm (ref 650 nm) was measured using a spectrophotometer (&#x003bc;Quant; BioTek).</p></sec><sec><title>CD marker analysis</title><p>Cultures of hBMMSCs were analyzed for expression of MSC related cluster of differentiation (CD) markers. Briefly, monolayer cultures of hBMMSCs were dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) for 3 min. Trypsin activity was inhibited by addition of culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 g &#x000d7; 5 min and the cell pellet was then resuspended in phosphate buffered saline without calcium and magnesium (PBS-) containing 3% FBS to obtain single cell suspension. Separate aliquots (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells) were used for MSC isotype cocktail (Miltenyi Biotec), MSC phenotyping cocktail (Miltenyi Biotec) or in combination with other primary monoclonal antibodies (CD44, CD29&#x02014;BD Pharmingen) to avoid interference with same fluorochromes. The MSC isotype cocktail comprised of fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies, namely mouse IgG1-FITC, mouse IgG1-PE, mouse IgG1-APC, mouse IgG1-PerCp and mouse IG2a-PerCp. The MSC phenotyping cocktail comprised of both positive (CD73-APC, CD90-FITC, CD105-PE) and negative (CD34/CD45/CD14/CD20-PerCp) fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies. The cells were incubated with respective antibodies at 1:10 dilution for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C; then washed with 1 mL of 3% FBS and centrifuged at 300 g &#x000d7; 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;l of 3% FBS before analysis using a FACS Aria III instrument (BD BioSciences), which is equipped with a 488 nM (blue) laser and a 561-nM (yellow-green) laser for uncoupled excitation and detection of FITC and PE fluorochromes. In addition to increasing the sensitivity of PE detection, this set-up eliminated the PE-FITC spill over, thereby eliminating the need for compensation. As an additional measure, single-stained control tubes for each color was analyzed to rule out the need for compensation as well as set up the detection range for each fluorochrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trypan blue viability/population doubling time</title><p>The hBMMSCs were seeded at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 24 well plate and cultured for up to 3 days to determine cell viability and population doubling time (PDT). The cells were trypsinized daily at the same time and the live/dead cell counts were obtained following trypan blue vital staining. Three replicates were carried out for each sample. PDT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.doubling-time.com">http://www.doubling-time.com</ext-link>) was calculated using the formula:

Epidemiological data from the Middle East indicate an increase in the aging and overweight/obese population, both of which are strong risk factors for the development of OA (Loeser et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, it is predicted that OA will grow into a significant health problem in the Middle East as it has become in the West.</p><p>Damaged cartilage has a limited self-healing capacity dues to the limited numbers of chondrocytes in mature tissue, poor responses to anabolic factors, impaired extracellular matrix production and lack of blood vessels (Henrotin and Reginster, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Attempts to stimulate intrinsic cartilage repair by bone drilling or microfracturing can promote recruitment of stem cells into the defect area. The presence of MSCs in synovial membrane/fluid is another indication of the potential reparative role that stem cells may play in damaged joint tissue regeneration (Harvanov&#x000e1; et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Miller et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow, adipose tissue, synovium, umbilical cord and peripheral blood have been used in the management of OA (Richardson et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Orth et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, a robust cell type that can be easily harvested and display a high proliferative capacity and chondrogenic potential will be offer significant advantageous for the development of cellular therapies. A recent comparative study on hBMMSCs and adipose tissue derived MSCs (ADMSCs) seeded on Chondro-Gide scaffolds and exposed to chondrogenic medium, identified good proliferation and cartilaginous extracellular matrix deposition with hBMMSCs compared to ADMSCs (Kohli et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), highlighting the advantage of the former cell type for the development of regenerative medicine approaches.</p><p>hBMMSCs derived from OA patients have shown variations with respect to cell proliferation; in some cases cell yields and proliferative indices are high whereas in others they are very poor. Effective expansion of isolated cells is another challenge as the major problem with autologus therapy is the availability of adequate numbers of stem cells. The inoculum density of cells for use in a single 3 mm-4 mm deep subchondral bone drilling site is approximately 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells (Haleem et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Therefore, a minimum of 10&#x02013;12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells may be needed for use in 4-6 drill defects. Moreover, these numbers must be achieved in less than 3&#x02013;4 subcultures to avoid cellular de-differentiation. In the present study, we were able to successfully achieve increased cell yields (approximately about 12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells in three to four passages from an initial number of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells from 5 ml of bone marrow aspirate). Most cells in culture remained viable as shown by the trypan blue viability assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) and these cells exhibited a short PDT. However, as expected, the target cell expansion was not achieved in some elderly patients. This could be due to the intrinsic senescent nature of the cells as, there appears to be an inverse relationship with cell numbers and aging (Choumerianou et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>The derived and expanded hBMMSCs from OA patients were identified to satisfy the minimal criteria set by ISCT. The cells were plastic adherent; showed expression of CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD29 and lacked expression of CD34 and CD45 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These cells also demonstrated tri-lineage differentiation into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, in our previous studies of hBMMSCs and human Wharton's Jelly stem cells (hWJSCs) we have demonstrated expression of both osteogenic and chondrogenic related gene and protein expression (Baksh et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Gauthaman et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In addition, we have shown increased production and secretion of collagen and alkaline phosphatase activity following chondrocytic and osteocytic differentiation respectively, similar to earlier studies obtained by our group and by other investigators (Baksh et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Gauthaman et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Fong et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Brady et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Exposing hBMMSCs to an illuminated arthroscope resulted in decreased metabolic activity of the cells maintained in suspension. However, cell pellets exposed to an illuminated arthroscope demonstrated increased numbers of metabolically active cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,C</xref>). Initially the metabolically active cell numbers increased and remained stable in suspension cultures that were exposed to the illuminated arthroscope for 10 and 20 min. This could be due to the free floating individual cell movements within the medium resulting in a shorter duration of close range exposure of single cells to the illuminated source unlike the outer layer of cells in the pellet, which remained in the same position for the entire duration of exposure. This was reflected initially as lower metabolic activity and/or survival in the cell pellets compared to the cell in suspensions. In contrast, longer exposure of the illuminated arthroscope and the resultant rise in temperature would have affected the suspended cells more adversely compared to most cells in the pellets, expect those that were present in the outer layer. Earlier studies have identified that heat-shock generated by orthopedic procedures leads to death of the transplanted cells. Cell recovery following immediate exposure to 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s to 1 min and subsequent evaluation of proliferation after 12, 24, and 96 h has identified that proliferation decreases and death results almost immediately (mostly by necrosis) (Dolan et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, mild heat shock and exposure of cells to temperatures up to 47&#x000b0;C result in positive osteointegration by osteoprogenitors (Zaffagnini et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). In contrast to the above studies, the temperature ranged from 27.6 to 37.3&#x000b0;C, indicating that sub-physiological temperature changes or cold-shock can also adversely affect the metabolic activity of transplanted cells. Previous studies have also reported that arthroscopic procedures may be involved with either supra-physiologic or sub-physiologic changes in temperature following low-flow irrigation or cryotherapy (Zaffagnini et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Horstman and McLaughlin, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Moreover, the cell aggregates (pellets) were better protected against cold-shock than the cell suspensions.</p><p>Differentiation of the BMMSCs following heat shock was not undertaken in the present study, which becomes a constraint to support our other findings. This would have provided additional insights into the functional ability of these cells. Although more in depth studies are needed to understand the mechanisms behind the cold/heat shock related decrease in metabolic activity and/or cell survival, our preliminary findings indicate that in autologous settings the use of hBMMSCs together with chondrocytes may have a protective effect on the transplanted stem cells.</p><p>Gene expression studies confirmed that hBMMSCs exposed to increased temperatures resulted in significant upregulation of apoptotic (BAX, P53), cell cycle (Cylcin A2, Cyclin E2) as well as injury and heat shock related (TNF-&#x003b1;, HSP70) genes in cell suspensions compared to cell pellets. Previous studies have reported that increases in temperature ranging from 47 to 70&#x000b0;C as a result of surgical procedures may impair the survival of MSCs (Gill et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Thermal stress is known to induce profound changes in protein function and gene expression which in turn activate cellular adaptive mechanisms that help to protect the organism (Lepp&#x000e4; and Sistonen, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Hettler et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We observed that the heat shock protein HSP70 was increased significantly, which is indicative of an adaptive response of the cells to overcome heat stress and interestingly this was more pronounced in the cell suspension group. Increased expression HSP70 is one of the most important responses following physical and chemical stresses including elevated temperature, exposure to heavy metals, pharmacological agents and bacterial toxins (Sonna et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Dolan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Increasing temperatures beyond the threshold limit for a given cell type is known to either activate the apoptotic program or result in cellular necrosis in extreme situations (Creagh et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Sonna et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Dolan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We also observed that in cell suspensions proapoptotic BAX was increased and the antiapoptotic BCL2 was decreased, indicating that the hBMMSCs were undergoing cell death. Cyclin E2 is involved in G1/S phase of cell cycle progression and cyclin A2 is involved in regulation of G2/M phase of cell cycle. Heat stress following radiation upregulate HSP which in turn augments cell cycle arrest at G1, S, and G2/M phases (Nitta et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The increased expression observed for cyclin E2 and Cyclin A2 in cell suspensions may be indicative of an attempt to overcome the heat stress and promote cell survival. The expression level probably decreased as the heat stressed cells in the suspension group underwent necrotic death unlike the pellet group. In addition, P53 is known to influence expression of numerous target genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis, gene instability, senescence following stress (Morselli et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Increased expression of P53 was observed following heat stress, and P53 is associated with negative regulation of cell cycle progression (Reisman et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). If the gene expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21 had been included in the study, it would have provided additional information on the cell proliferation ability following heat shock of hBMMSCs.</p><p>The introduction of MSCs into the joint can be achieved either through injection as a cell suspension or through loading onto a scaffold as an implant. Our findings offer caution when the former approach is used since the cells are not encased by a matrix that can protect them from external factors such as heat from the arthroscope. This study suggests that improvizations in surgical methods that avoid generating large amounts of heat may result in more favorable outcomes when applying MSCs in cell suspension to treat an arthritic joint. Alternatively, administration of cells in combination with biodegradable materials as pellets/encapsulations might enhance the survival of transplanted cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>hBMMSCs from OA patients have the capacity to expand and actively differentiate. However, they are prone to damage if the method of delivery to the joint is not optimal and is accompanied by the generation of excess heat. Less invasive and more cytoprotective surgical methods that do not generate excess heat are needed to ensure successful therapeutic delivery of MSCs to the joint.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>MAb and MAl are the clinicians and were involved in providing clinical materials/information and intellectual support.
