RT-QuIC can be used for the detection of prions in a variety of biological tissues from humans and animals. However, there is no such comparison of RT-QuIC data between BSE positive and presymptomatic cattle. Further, the current study assesses prion distribution in multiple brain regions of clinically ill or subclinical animals. Here, we compare RT-QuIC reactions seeded with brain samples collected from experimentally inoculated cattle that were clinically ill or subclinically affected with BSE. The results demonstrate RT-QuIC seeding in various brain regions of an animal with subclinical BSE despite being determined negative by immunohistochemistry. Bioassay of the subclinical animal and RT-QuIC of brainstem from inoculated knockout (<italic>PRNP</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic><sup><bold>/</bold></sup></italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cattle were used to confirm infectivity in the subclinical animal and determine that RT-QuIC reactions were not the result of residual inoculum, respectively. These results confirm that RT-QuIC is a highly sensitive prion detection assay that can detect prions in a steer prior to the onset of clinical signs of BSE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</kwd><kwd>diagnosis</kwd><kwd>prion diseases</kwd><kwd>prion protein</kwd><kwd>protein misfolding</kwd><kwd>real-time quaking-induced conversion</kwd><kwd>transmissible spongiform encephalopathy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="7077"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) belongs to a group of fatal neurologic diseases that result from the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into a pathogenic form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) in the brain (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Collectively, these diseases are referred to as prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In addition to BSE, the prion diseases include scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Str&#x000e4;ussler-Scheinker syndrome, and kuru in humans. Classical BSE is a feedborne disease in cattle and transmits to humans as variant CJD (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Currently approved BSE diagnostic tests are based on the direct detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by immunoblot, enzyme immunoassay (EIA or ELISA), or immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). New prion detection tools relying on the <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> have been developed and include protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Both of these approaches can amplify very low levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to levels that are readily detectable. PMCA is a very useful methodology for sensitive detection of prions in various samples of different species, but it requires an animal derived substrate (usually brain homogenate) and is time consuming because final analysis requires Western blotting. Unlike PMCA, RT-QuIC is a relatively simple technique that makes use of recombinant prion protein as a substrate. This technique monitors the fibril formation in real-time <italic>via</italic> binding of the fluorescent marker, thioflavin T (ThT), to the resulting amyloid fibrils. ThT fluorescence increases as the amount of amyloid fibril accumulates through conversion of monomeric PrP<sup>C</sup> to an amyloid conformation. The RT-QuIC assay has been shown to detect low levels of TSE infectivity and to detect human and animal prions in various tissues (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Even after experimental inoculation by the intracranial route, there is a period of time during incubation where PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is undetectable in brain samples when assayed by traditional diagnostic methods for prion diseases (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Amplification based assays, such as RT-QuIC represent an opportunity for evaluation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> distribution in situations where the level is anticipated to be low, such as during the preclinical incubation period. Currently, there is a lack of RT-QuIC data on detection of prion diseases in subclinical cattle. Here, we applied RT-QuIC to assess relative levels and distribution of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> among cattle in various groups: clinically affected with BSE; BSE inoculated, but without clinical signs of disease (subclinical); inoculated knockouts (<italic>PRNP</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) that did not develop clinical disease after long incubation periods, and sham-inoculated controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The laboratory and animal experiments were conducted in Biosafety Level 2 spaces that were inspected and approved for importing prion agents by the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services. The studies were done in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC, USA) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Research and Teaching (Federation of Animal Science Societies, Champaign, IL, USA). The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Animal Disease Center (protocol numbers: 3636 and 3985), which included a biosafety review. Cattle were monitored twice daily for the appearance of clinical signs suggestive of prion disease such as aggression, behavior changes, decreased feed intake, loss of body condition, ataxia, prolonged recumbency, or inability to rise. All inoculated animals developed the clinical signs specifically described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and no animals died prior to the experimental endpoint. To ensure a humane endpoint, animals were euthanized if they demonstrated clinical signs of prolonged anorexia (&#x0003e;24&#x02009;h) or recumbency (&#x0003e;12&#x02009;h). Animals exhibiting behavioral or postural changes consistent with TSE were examined by a veterinarian. Upon veterinary confirmation of unequivocal clinical signs of TSE, affected cattle were killed with an intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s directions and necropsied.

In the current study, an animal inoculated with classical BSE (No. 1) did not develop clinical illness and tested negative by standard diagnostics performed on brainstem despite a prolonged observation period of 31&#x02009;months. When brainstem tested negative by EIA, we tested additional brain regions by EIA and RT-QuIC and compared the results to those of animals clinically ill with BSE in an effort to explain the failure of this animal to develop clinical signs. Prion distribution differences between subclinical and clinical animals led us to perform additional RT-QuIC reactions in <italic>PRNP</italic> knockout animals to ensure our RT-QuIC results were not due to the presence of residual TSE inoculum. Prions were not detected in brain samples from <italic>PRNP</italic> knockout animals by WB, EIA, IHC, or RT-QuIC.</p><p>In the current study, RT-QuIC detected lower levels of prions than traditional diagnostic tools. IHC and WB failed to identify any PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the subclinical animal (No. 1), while testing multiple brain regions by EIA and RT-QuIC allowed us to detect misfolded protein in midbrain and thalamus. Further, we were able to detect seeding activity in brain regions including cerebrum and cerebellum that were negative by EIA. This result is consistent with a recent study that demonstrated that RT-QuIC is more sensitive for the detection of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> during early infection than tyramide signal amplification-IHC (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Real-time quaking-induced conversion has been successfully used for sensitive and specific detection of prion diseases for humans and animals (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). We previously reported different types of BSE prions can be detected and differentiated using RT-QuIC with recombinant bovine prion protein (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and the previous work of others evaluated detection and discrimination of classical, H-, and L-BSE prions by full-length chimeric hamster-sheep prion proteins, N-terminally truncated hamster prion protein [90&#x02013;231] (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), full-length sheep protein, and full-length bank vole protein (a.a. 23&#x02013;230). There has been significant effort to detect prions in presymptomatic diagnostic samples including CSF, blood, urine, saliva, and nasal brushings by RT-QuIC [7&#x02013;16]. CWD prions were detected in urine collected from presymptomatic deer and in fecal extracts by using RT-QuIC (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) suggesting potential applications in CWD surveillance and control.</p><p>In the present study, there were differences in prion distribution between the brains of subclinical and clinically affected cattle after intracranial BSE inoculation. In the subclinically affected steer (No. 1), the highest levels of prions accumulated in the thalamus and midbrain, while no prions were detected in the brainstem. Most likely this reflects prion accumulation in the location that the inoculum was deposited without further spread into other brain regions. A study comparing preclinical cattle infected naturally with BSE to clinically affected cattle either naturally or experimentally infected with BSE by the oral route found the most abundant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the brainstem area (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which is consistent with ascension to the brain from the gut by sympathetic and parasympathetic projections (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In our experiment, abundant prions were observed in the brainstem of cattle with clinical signs of BSE, which is similar to the amount in their thalamus or midbrain regions. Interestingly, prions in the brainstem of cattle with clinical evidence of BSE seeded the RT-QuIC reactions faster than any other brain region despite the brainstem area having lower EIA OD values (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) in comparison to other brain regions. This suggests that higher concentrations of prions do not necessarily seed the reaction faster. Perhaps prions of the brainstem exist in a preferred conformation for better conversion despite being present in lower concentrations.</p><p>Bioassay of brainstem from steer No. 1 confirmed infectivity and RT-QuIC results despite being negative by IHC, WB, and EIA. Bioassay was performed with a 10% homogenate as compared to 1% for the original classical BSE inoculum, yet the average incubation period longer confirming lower infectivity in the brainstem of the subclinical steer. We previously reported that the retinas of animals inoculated with the agent of classical BSE become substantially thinner than both their baseline (preinoculation) thickness and the thickness of sham-inoculated control animals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This decrease in retinal thickness preceded the onset of clinical signs by an average of 10&#x02009;months. It is interesting to note that in the previous study steer No. 1 had a substantially decreased retinal thickness value at 12&#x02009;months postinoculation and would have been classified as &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; by these previously reported criteria (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>After being observed for nearly 9&#x02009;months longer than other cattle in the same experimental group, a steer intracranially inoculated with classical BSE was euthanized without demonstrating clinical signs suggestive of prion disease. WB and IHC failed to demonstrate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in any region of the brain. In an effort to investigate the reason that this animal failed to develop clinical signs, further studies were conducted using RT-QuIC, which demonstrated high levels of prions in the thalamus and midbrain. In summary, we demonstrate that RT-QuIC can be useful to detect prions in cattle with subclinical BSE and that BSE prions can be differently distributed in the brain regions as incubation progresses.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC, USA) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Research and Teaching (Federation of Animal Science Societies, Champaign, IL, USA).
