Ethiopia has made remarkable progress in increasing contraceptive use rate but there is still a disparity of contraceptive use within the country. Although there were some studies about contraceptive use in Ethiopia, evidences about contraceptive use among sexually active HIV positive women was limited. Understanding the extent of and barriers in Ethiopia is important for learning how to best improve level of contraceptive use. Therefore, this study aimed to assess contraceptives use and associated factors among HIV positive sexually active women at anti-retroviral therapy clinic at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital ART clinic in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 01&#x02013;30, 2018 among (n = 308) randomly selected HIV positive women at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital. Data were collected using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Survey logistic regression analysis was employed to identify determinants of contraceptive use. Statistical significance was declared at p-value &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Out of three hundred eight participants, 118 (38.3%) reported contraceptive use at the time of the study.

Participants with younger age (15&#x02013;34years), who disclosed HIV status to sex partner, had history of contraceptive use, and who were sexually active six months prior to the study were more likely to use contraception. However, participants who had drinking habit were less likely to use contraception. These results suggest that multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary approaches are needed to increase contraceptive use in the HIV positive women.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Public Health; Infectious Disease; Immunology; Women's Health; Reproductive System; Clinical Research; Contraceptive use; Human immune virus positive women; Bahir dar; Ethiopia; reproductive health</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Infectious disease</kwd><kwd>Immunology</kwd><kwd>Women's health</kwd><kwd>Reproductive system</kwd><kwd>Clinical research</kwd><kwd>Contraceptive use</kwd><kwd>Human immune virus positive women</kwd><kwd>Bahir dar</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd><kwd>Reproductive health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Even though the global community is working to end HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, it remains a major global epidemic in post millennium development era [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It remains the leading cause of illness and death throughout the world. Since the start of the epidemic, around 76.1 million peoples infected and 35 million people died of AIDS related illness [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2017, 36.9 million people were living with HIV; 1.8 million people were newly infected worldwide. From these, 18.2 million were women of reproductive age and 1.8 were children under-15 years old [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Ethiopia, there were an estimated total 722,248 people infected with HIV, 14,872 annual AIDS related deaths, 22,827 new HIV infection in 2017 [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, women, infants and young children account for more than 60 percent of new HIV infections [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to a 2013 family health international report, there were about 100,000 pregnancy of HIV positive women and 12,000 HIV positive births annually, mostly unintended pregnancies in Ethiopia [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Family planning is one of a key intervention to curve HIV/AIDS epidemic [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It allows people including HIV positive women to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health through information, education and contraceptive methods [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HIV positive women, like other women, may wish to plan pregnancy, limit their family and avoid pregnancy [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the time when approximately 36.9 people are living with HIV/AIDS [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and women of reproductive age accounts for nearly half of the infected population, family planning plays a critical role in averting HIV/AIDS epidemic by reducing unintended pregnancy [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite, unmet need of for family planning remains high in most of the world countries especially in low and middle income countries [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By the year 2015&#x02013;2019, the proportion of unintended pregnancy ending in abortion was 61% increased by 10% in 2000&#x02013;2004 which was 51% [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 2012, there were approximately 85 million unintended pregnancies [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Besides, 190 million reproductive age women worldwide who wanted to avoid pregnancy were not using any method of contraception in 2019 [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Unintended pregnancy is a major root cause for abortion. Each year, about 22 million unsafe abortions occur contributing for 67,000 annual maternal deaths worldwide [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Africa, nearly 5.5 million women have unsafe abortion. Nearly, 36,000 of these women die of the abortion procedure [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The situation is worse in Ethiopia. Low levels of contraceptive use including in HIV positive women lead to high level of unintended pregnancy [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">Unsafe abortion is a major cause to the sustained high global maternal mortality and morbidity. Legal abortion and access to reproductive health and contraceptive have been pointed out as a vital to reduce abortion rate [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Accordingly, Ethiopia has liberalized its abortion law in 2005, which had previously allowed the procedure only to save the life of a woman or protect her physical health. Now abortion is legal in Ethiopia in case of rape, incest, fetal impairment and if the fetus has severe defect, or if a girl is under the age of 18 years old [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite, a substantial number of abortions continue to occur outside health facilities unsafely [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Family planning has a tremendous benefit to the world population. Advancing human rights, reducing poverty, improving nutrition, saving millions of lives, advancing gender equality and empowerment contributing to the economic growth are some of the benefits of family planning [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">Many factors affect contraceptive use. Economic factors, Cultural factor, location, education, attitude and knowledge about contraception, cultural beliefs, myths and misconceptions about contraception are some of the factors affecting contraceptive utilization [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also, previous studies done on HIV positive women showed that HIV status disclosure, previous contraceptive use, age, drinking habit, and sexual activity are determinant of contraceptive use [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">The prevalence of any method contraceptives varies across the countries and within each country. In sub-Saharan Africa, Eswatini and Namibia (both 52%) have the highest level of modern contraceptive prevalence in 2019, whereas South Sudan 4% and Chad 6% had the lowest level [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Ethiopia, one of sub-Saharan country, has made remarkable progress in increasing contraceptive prevalence rate over the last 15 years. Despite this success, there is a disparity of contraceptive use rate between regions, urban and rural areas, and younger and older women [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Modern contraceptive prevalence rate among married women has increased from 14% in 2005 to 41% in 2019 [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Previous studies in the Ethiopia have demonstrated that the rate of contraceptive use ranged between 36.3% in wollega, Ethiopia [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 50% in Gondar, Ethiopia [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although there were some studies about contraceptive use in Ethiopia, evidence about contraceptive use among sexually active HIV positive women is limited.

The most common contraceptive used was injectable (43.5%) followed by pills (21.4) and implant (19.2%). Previous study done in Gondor Hospital, Ethiopia and Nigeria [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have reported similar findings. The current study revealed that only one hundred eighteen (38.3%) sexually active HIV positive reproductive age women were using any method of contraception. The finding was consistent with the study done in wollega, Ethiopia (36.3%) [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Kenya (38.5%) [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, the finding of the current study was lower than evidences from Zambia (69 %) [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], North West Ethiopia (47.7%) [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Uganda (55.1%) [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], Ireland (55%) [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (43.6%) [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Tanzania (54%), and Gondar, Ethiopia (50%) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the prevalence of this study was higher than the studies done in Southwestern Uganda (27.8%) [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and western Africa (8%) [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Prevalence variation might be due socio-demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, timing of the studies, cultural dissimilarities and differences in health care service utilization of study population and the referenced population.</p><p id="p0135">Many factors have predicted contraceptive use in the current study. Among these factors, HIV positive women with younger age (15&#x02013;34 years old) were more likely to use contraceptive method compared with older (35&#x02013;49 years old). Previous studies in Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have reported similar findings. Other evidences have also shown that as the women gets older their need for contraception and rate of contraceptive use decreases [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This could be explained in terms of young mothers are usually more open to accept modern technology, often less bound to cultural beliefs that hider contraceptive utilization and better educated than older mothers than older mothers. In addition, younger mothers might regard themselves at risk of unplanned pregnancy while older women might not regard themselves at risk of pregnancy due to their older age. These explanations are supported by studies from Nigeria and Namibia [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] which showed that there is a significant association between educational status and contraceptive usage. Older mothers are also affected by cultural and religious beliefs that oppose contraceptive utilization, and they assume that they cannot get pregnant at their perimenopause period [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Currently, national and international family planning interventions focus on younger women but the finding of this study suggests that family planning intervention should be directed towards both younger and older women.</p><p id="p0140">Similarly, HIV positive women with previous contraceptive use history were more likely to use contraception compared with their counterparts. The finding is in congruent with studies done in different part of Ethiopia [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Uganda [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The possible explanation could be due to past contraceptive use experience could minimize myths and misconceptions heard about contraception. There are some myths and misconceptions that hinder women from contraceptive use. For example, &#x0201c;some people believe that implants inserted in the arm could migrate to the brain and causes brain disease including brain cancer and contraceptive use can end up with infertility&#x0201d;. Other misconceptions about family planning include, contraceptive users end up with health problems, contraceptives are dangerous for woman's health and contraceptive use can damage woman's womb [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous study in urban Africa has demonstrated that negative myths and misconceptions about family planning in the community are barriers to modern contraceptive utilization [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This suggests that community based educational programs are needed to dispel common myths and misconceptions about contraception especially for new contraceptive users.</p><p id="p0145">HIV positive women who disclosed their HIV status to their partners had higher odds of using contraception. Previous studies from Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Zambia [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have reported similar findings. This highlights that disclosure of HIV status to a sexual partner might ease communication between sexual partners to make decision about reproductive issues including contraceptive use. Asfaw et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] has concluded that disclosure of HIV status is important to get support from family especially, husband and discussion can clarify uncertainties about contraceptives and possibly to increase confidence of women. A study from Tanzania [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] has shown that couple-communication facilitates the uptake of contraceptive utilization among HIV-positive reproductive age women. Another study in Tigray region, Ethiopia [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] has also indicated that open discussion with husbands/sexual partners about contraceptive methods was positively associated with contraceptive utilization. Moreover, a study in Uganda [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] has revealed that women who did not disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners were less likely to use contraception. This implies that health care providers in ART clinics must discuss with clients about disclosure of HIV status to their sexual partners.</p><p id="p0150">Having Sexual activity in the last six months prior to the commencement of the study also was significantly associated with contraceptive use. Participants who had sexual activity in the last six months prior to the study were 5-folds more likely to use contraception compared with participants who had not sexual activity. The finding is in agreement with studies from Ethiopia and Zambia and Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The possible explanation could be HIV positive women who are engaged in sexual activity have concern about the risk of pregnancy if they don't use contraceptive methods. A previous study in Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] has indicated that the odds of contraceptive use was increased for women who had unprotected sex either with partner or outside partner. This suggests that women who are engaged in sexual activity should be appropriately counseled for family planning and provided with accessible contraceptive methods.</p><p id="p0155">On the other hand, HIV- positive reproductive age women who had drinking habit were less likely to use contraceptive methods. The result is in line with the study conducted in Uganda [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This highlights that alcohol can affect women's judgment and memory. A woman consuming excessive amount of alcohol may forget to take the pill or use condom at that day. Previous studies in Britain and United States of America [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] have demonstrated that women having drinking habit are usually engaged in risky sexual behaviors that expose to unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection. A systematic review by Terplan et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] has also indicated that women with substance use disorders including alcohol used contraception less often than non-substance-users. Another study from USA [<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] revealed that risk drinking is related to ineffective contraception and condom use. The finding suggests that women with drinking habits should be provided with appropriate long acting contraceptive methods or be counseled to avoid the daily basis contraceptive methods.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitation</title><p id="p0160">This study has some limitations. First, the study was cross-sectional in nature so that cause and effect relationship cannot be established. Second, men were not included in the study in spite of they have important role to play in deciding about fertility issues and family size. Third, as fertility issue is a sensitive topic, social desirability bias cannot be avoided.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0165">A significant proportion of HIV positive women had low level of contraceptive use that was lower than the national recommended level. Injectable was the most preferred method of contraception while convenience was the main reason for contraceptive use. Participants with younger age (15&#x02013;34years), who disclosed HIV status to sex partner, had history of contraceptive use, and who were sexually active six months prior to the study were more likely to use contraception. However, participants who had drinking habit were less likely to use contraception. Integration of family planning service with ART service and increased attention to women having drinking habit are recommended. These results suggest that multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary approaches are needed to increase contraceptive use in the HIV positive women. Lastly, interventional and longitudinal studies are needed to improve contraceptive use among HIV positive reproductive age women.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0170">T.
