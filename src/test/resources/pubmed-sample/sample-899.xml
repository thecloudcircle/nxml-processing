To our SmartPhrases, we added hyperlinks (to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbirtonline.org">http://www.sbirtonline.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drugabuse.gov">http://www.drugabuse.gov</ext-link>) to make pertinent brochures immediately available.</p><p>To "charge capture" and retrieve BIs, we used the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for alcohol and drug counseling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 155 randomly selected patient encounters prior to using the EHR, there were no encounters with a validated alcohol use screening instrument, and in only 1 encounter (0.6 %) was there a valid BI. After transitioning to the EHR and educating residents, 43 of 97 (44.3%, p &#x0003c; 0.05) randomly selected patient encounters included a validated alcohol use screening instrument, but only 4 of 97 (4.1%) contained evidence of a BI. Over time, with continued training, including conferences and reminders from attending physician "champions," residents performed more BIs. For the year April 2014 through March 2015, documented BIs averaged 11 per month (1.3% of total monthly patient encounters).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Though the resulting workaround process may not be "seamless," EHR users can independently implement validated screening questionnaires. With proper IT expertise, Best Practice Advisory/Health Maintenance Reminder (BPA/HMR) "pop-ups" can increase the automaticity of screening, enforce the necessity of screening, and minimize the chances of "losing" documentation of screening (such as when residents fail to "charge capture.") The BPA/HMR method, with automatic periodic reminders which the provider must address - in perpetuity - before moving to the next step in encounter documentation, should aid sustainability of alcohol and drug use screening and intervention programs.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Aaron Johnson, PhD and Eric Shaw, PhD for their contributions to editing and statistical analysis.</p></sec></back></article>
