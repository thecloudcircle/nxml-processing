A randomized controlled trial with baseline, post-intervention, and 10-week follow-up, that explores the effects of animal assisted therapy (AAT) was conducted. In total, 53 adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence were randomized in an intervention (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) versus waiting list control group (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;26). The remarkable adherence to the therapy program by study participants and the program&#x02019;s clinically relevant effects indicate that AAT with dogs can be used to reduce perceived stress and symptoms of agoraphobia, and to improve social awareness and communication in adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Autism</kwd><kwd>Adults</kwd><kwd>Animal assisted therapy</kwd><kwd>Dogs</kwd><kwd>Stress-related problems</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Stichting Olim</institution></funding-source><award-id>D14800</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="Par2">Stress-related mental health problems such as depression and anxiety are very common in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affecting up to 77% of this population (Joshi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). Stress is strongly associated with depression and anxiety (Vreeburg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref>), premature mortality and poor health outcomes (Slavich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>), and severity of ASD traits, which include problems in social interaction and communication (Hirvikoski and Blomqvist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>). To date, research on effective interventions that aim to reduce stress and stress-related outcomes in people with ASD or to improve their social interaction and communication has been very limited (Damiano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>). A few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted on interventions in ASD suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) can be effective for reducing depression and anxiety (Sizoo and Kuiper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). This effect may partially be explained by physical stress reduction, e.g. measured using markers such as salivary cortisol (Vreeburg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no RCTs have been reported that directly target perceived stress in the adult ASD population.</p><p id="Par3">Several studies not specific to adults with ASD have shown that physical interactions with animals reduce stress levels (Beetz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). In children with ASD, animal assisted therapies (AAT) (i.e., interventions that incorporate trained animals) have also shown promising results for stress-related outcomes (O&#x02019;Haire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). Improvements in social interaction and communication have also been reported (Berry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>; Gabriels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). AAT may be especially well suited to people with ASD because animals communicate non-verbally, which may be a less stressful form of interaction than a conversation with a therapist involving metacognitive and introspective aspects (Verheggen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). It has been hypothesized that in therapeutic settings, animals act as social catalysts, causing patients to become more willing to communicate with their social environment which in turn facilitates improvements in social interaction and communication (Gabriels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). Although the described effects of AAT (mostly with dogs) in children with ASD are promising, it is not clear whether these results can be generalized to adults. Importantly, AAT studies in children report a number of limitations such as small sample sizes, limited or no verification of the ASD diagnosis, limited descriptions of the intervention, and lack of control groups, randomization, and validated outcome measures (O&#x02019;Haire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no interventions that include human&#x02013;animal interactions have ever been reported in adults with ASD.</p><p id="Par4">To summarize evidence on animal assisted therapy (AAT) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we conducted a systematic search of PubMed looking specifically for reports published in Dutch and English between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015. Studies were eligible if they were treatment effect studies, included people with ASD, and contained at least one treatment group that incorporated a live animal. We identified a total of 18 studies. The animals in these studies included dogs, horses, guinea pigs, lamas, and dolphins. None of the studies included participants of 18&#x000a0;years or older. We extended the systematic search to reports published between January 1, 1995, and April 16, 2018, and still found no research that included participants with ASD who were 18&#x000a0;years or older.</p><p id="Par5">Our study contributes to the scientific literature by specifically including adults with ASD, by using an appropriate sample size for an explorative effect study, and including a control group, randomization, and valid outcome measures.</p><p id="Par6">Previous studies in children with ASD have shown that AAT offers promising results in terms of stress reduction and improvements in social communication skills. Our study shows that the highly understudied population of adults with ASD can also benefit from AAT in similar ways, including reduction of perceived stress, agoraphobia and improvements in one of the core aspects in ASD, social responsiveness (as reported by proxies).</p><p id="Par7">We considered the effects of AAT in children with ASD (O&#x02019;Haire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Gabriels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>) and hypothesized that in adults with ASD, AAT may result in stress reduction, improvements in social responsiveness (social awareness, communication, and motivation), and reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, which are strongly related to stress (Vreeburg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref>). Considering that stress-reducing effects of dogs were reported in the general population (Beetz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>) and that dogs are the animals most commonly employed in AAT with children with ASD (O&#x02019;Haire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>), our aim was to explore the effects of AAT with dogs in adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence. We focused on self-perceived stress, social responsiveness, and psychological symptoms (such as depression and anxiety symptoms). Furthermore, we looked at AAT&#x02019;s effects on self-esteem in this same group&#x02014;an important addition, given that adults with ASD were found to have lower self-esteem than adults without ASD and that self-esteem is strongly negatively correlated with the stress-related outcomes depression and anxiety (Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par8">The randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two arms (the intervention condition and the waiting list control condition) was conducted between January 2015 and July 2017 and had an exploratory character due to the lack of evidence on AAT in adults with ASD. Subjects entered the study at seven pre-planned starting times, with recruitment continuing until 17 February 2017. For each participant, baseline assessment was followed by the post-intervention assessment (T1, 10 weeks post-baseline) and the follow-up assessment (T2, 20 weeks post-baseline). All waiting list controls were offered the option of individual AAT after T2.</p><p id="Par9">Detailed information about recruitment and screening procedures is reported elsewhere (Wijker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par10">All study participants were recruited sequentially in batches from the mental health care organization GGZ Oost Brabant, The Netherlands, which has a psychiatric outpatient center for adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence. Information flyers in the waiting room and verbal information from therapists were used for recruitment. Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosed with ASD, between 18 and 60&#x000a0;years of age, and an IQ of 80 or above. Because the intervention was developed to reduce perceived stress and comorbid symptoms in ASD, only participants with a score considered to be high on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen and Williamson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1988</xref>, scores&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;19) and on the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1994</xref>, scores&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;132) were included. Exclusion criteria were current psychosis or suicide risk as indicated by the person&#x02019;s psychologist or psychiatrist, institutionalization, allergy to dogs, fear of dogs, aversion to dogs, and participation in a treatment other than AAT during the study period (psychopharmacological treatment was allowed as long as the medication remained stable during the study). When an ASD diagnosis and/or IQ score was missing, a standardized diagnostic procedure was conducted by a multidisciplinary team, by a combination of the autistic disorder interview-revised (ADI-R) (Lord et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>), a semi-structured interview of the DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>) and clinical observations.

Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 &#x02018;none&#x02019; to 5 &#x02018;very severe&#x02019;.

The therapy goals for children with ASD who participated in previous research on AAT were improving social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and reducing physiological stress (O&#x02019;Haire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). The AAT program for this trial was developed by therapists and dog behavioral specialists from the Dutch service dog foundation Stichting Hulphond Nederland and psychologists from the mental health care organization GGZ Oost Brabant who have a specialization in autism. The program had a structured protocol and consisted of 10 weekly one-on-one sessions of 60&#x000a0;min per session. A therapy dog was involved during all the therapy sessions. The therapists providing AAT had a college or university degree in mental health care and were specialized in working with adults with ASD. Additionally, the AAT therapists had completed advanced courses in dog behavior and welfare. The Dutch service dog foundation Stichting Hulphond Nederland provided the therapy dogs. In total, thirteen therapy dogs were involved in the study (two Labradors, four Labrador crossbreeds, one golden retriever, three golden retriever crossbreeds, two poodles, and one German Wirehaired Pointer). All of the participating dogs were trained and tested to work with people, and their mental and physical health care was strictly monitored by the service dog foundation. Detailed information about the AAT program has been described elsewhere (Wijker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">At baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 10-week follow-up (T0, T1, and T2), participants were asked to fill in questionnaires in the following order: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), symptom checklist 90-revised (SCL-90-R), Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) and Social Responsiveness Scale-Adults (SRS-A). A stimulus-poor laboratory setting was used at the mental health care organization. A research assistant checked for missing items and asked participants to complete the missing items before leaving the assessment room. Participants received the SRS-A informant version and were asked to have a spouse, close family member, or friend complete the questionnaire. The same informants were to be used at all three assessments (T0, T1, and T2). Informants were asked to return the questionnaire during the week following each assessment. When the proxy-report was not returned, it was reported as missing and not included in analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="Par19">IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 was used for descriptive statistics and building mixed models.

In participants with missing items (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), self-report scales (PSS, SCL-90-R, RSES and SRS-A self-reports) had no more than 10% of their items missing. Fourteen SRS-A questionnaires were not returned and therefore were not included in the analyses.</p><p id="Par20">All participants in the intervention group participated in at least nine of the ten therapy sessions and for this reason we did not account for adherence (the number of sessions a participant received) as we had originally planned (Wijker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">To estimate the intervention effect, we used linear mixed models with random intercepts and accounting for repeated measurements within participants.</p><p id="Par22">In line with the exploratory character of the study, both the total scales&#x02019; scores (PSS, SCL-90, RSES, and SRS-A) and the scores of the subscales (SCL-90 and the SRS-A) were used as outcomes.

In addition, we did not correct for multiple testing and built two models per outcome: (1) with main fixed effects (the intervention condition [yes/no] and the assessment time points [T1 and T2 compared to T0] and (2) a mixed model with the same fixed terms and preplanned covariates age (years), gender (male versus female), having a dog at home at T0 (yes/no), and WAIS total IQ. During the trial, psychotropic medication was changed for some participants, and therefore, additional analysis was run with dummy variable change in medication [yes/no] to explore effects on main outcome variables. To explore whether the intervention effect differed for T1 and T2, the models with an interaction term for the time points and the condition were compared to models without this interaction term.

Furthermore, the results implied that AAT reduced impairments in social responsiveness as rated by participants&#x02019; spouses, close family members, or friends. There was an indication that depressive symptoms reduced due to the therapy. The analyses implied that these effects, small to medium in size, remained at the 10-week follow-up.</p><p id="Par34">Participant adherence to the therapy program was noteworthy. All participants in the intervention group took part in at least nine out of the ten intervention sessions. Only one recruited participant, who was allocated to the waiting list control group, did not complete the study. The adherence rate (98%) was higher than that reported in other ASD studies (Hesselmark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; Turner-Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2008</xref>; 62&#x02013;92%). Therefore, it can be argued that the intervention is feasible in adults with ASD who are motivated to receive it.</p><p id="Par35">The reduction of self-perceived stress seen in the intervention condition might be due to AAT&#x02019;s focus on gaining insight into participants&#x02019; own stress levels and finding ways to reduce stress. It could also be that AAT creates a relaxing context for participants. For example, each AAT session in our study included a period of free interaction with a dog. The positive effects of physical contact with an animal are supported by several studies in the general population that showed reduction of self-perceived or physiological stress due to human&#x02013;animal interactions (Beetz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). More specific to ASD, two studies in children with ASD showed reductions of physiological stress confirmed by lower (awakening) cortisol levels (Tabares et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>; Viau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). Viau et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>) found that cortisol awakening response decreased in children with ASD after service dogs were placed in their homes. However, this effect disappeared after the dog was removed. In our study the intervention effect remained at the 10-week follow-up. It is plausible that the difference in follow-up effects might be explained by nature of the intervention, e.g. placing a service dog into a home compared to including a therapy dog in a clinical setting. More research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of the self-perceived stress reduction and a longer follow-up may shed light on the intervention&#x02019;s long-term effects.</p><p id="Par36">Although the intervention showed a reduction of psychological and physical problems, this effect did not reach the level of statistical significance for a combined scale score, and the effect-size only slightly outperformed the threshold for clinical significance of d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20 (Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1988</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">Remarkably, exploration of subscales showed an intervention effect on agoraphobia. To the best of our knowledge, this variable has not been explored previously in AAT research in children with ASD. A possible explanation for the effect on agoraphobia may be that during the last three sessions of the intervention, participants, accompanied by the therapist and the dog, worked on social fears and controlling environmental stimuli by leaving the mental health facility and practice in the outside world. Social and/or environmental fear in the outside world reflects the main concept of agoraphobia. Another possible explanation for the intervention&#x02019;s effect on agoraphobia relates to the relationship between stress and agoraphobia (Vreeburg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref>): the reduction in perceived stress may have resulted in a decrease of agoraphobia and fear in social environments, while reduced agoraphobia might likewise reduce perceived stress.</p><p id="Par38">Alongside agoraphobia, models both with and without covariates, showed a reduction in depression scores with clinical relevance (d&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.20) in the intervention condition. When corrected for covariates, this effect did not reach statistical significance, which may point to some power problems. More research is certainly needed since previous research showed the relation between stress and depression and therefore might indicate that reductions in perceived stress might also reduce depression (Vreeburg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref>). Furthermore, the physical activity and social contact experienced during the therapy sessions might also reduce depressive feelings and thoughts and contribute to a participant&#x02019;s sense of purpose. In future research, more focus on AAT&#x02019;s effects on depression can be achieved by using depression-specific instruments and recruiting participants with a clinical diagnosis of depression.</p><p id="Par39">The proxy-reported improvements in social responsiveness are in line with findings in studies in children with ASD. However, these latter studies mainly show improvements on a more basic level of social communication (e.g., eye gazing, making sounds, or speaking words), which were rated using observations and video recordings (O&#x02019;Haire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). Gabriels et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>) used the same instrument used in our study, but to measure social responsiveness in a therapeutic horseback-riding program for children with ASD. They found similar results in the proxy reports and hypothesized that improved social communication skills might be attributed to the unique capacity of animals to serve as a social support or act as a social catalyst in a therapeutic setting. This may make participants more willing to communicate with their environment, leading to improvements in social responsiveness perceived by proxies. These might also have been underlying mechanisms in the adults in our study. However, several other mechanisms, such as modeling and natural (embodied) attunement (synchrony in movement, such as walking speed or eye gazing) might have played a role (Verheggen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). More research is needed to examine these hypotheses.</p><p id="Par40">Although we did find an intervention effect in proxy reports on social responsiveness, no effect was found for self-reports of the same outcome. Because adults with ASD may have poor self-awareness (Kievit and Geurts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>), the validity of their self-reports might be unclear. We suggest using other measures for social responsiveness, such as observational instruments, to explore the differences in results between proxy and self-reports.</p><p id="Par41">Regarding potential covariates in our study, older age was associated with more impairment in social responsiveness. This is in line with Lever and Geurts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>), who found an age-effect for self-reported ASD traits, with the highest scores in middle adulthood (39&#x02013;54&#x000a0;years). It was suggested that higher demands such as work, social life, and raising children may explain the age effect (Lever and Geurts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">Results showed no significant intervention effects on self-esteem. Literature shows that interventions directly focusing on improving self-esteem are more effective than interventions focusing on other targets (Haney and Durlak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>), as it was in our intervention. In contrast to high stress and psychological symptoms, low self-esteem was not an inclusion criterion for participants. In future research, it is important to consider how self-esteem should be targeted in ASD, especially when participants show average levels, as they did in our study.</p><p id="Par43">The study protocol was executed very strictly; study participants were very committed and showed up at every measurement.</p><p id="Par44">A limitation of this study was the relatively small sample size. It is possible, that some of the effects would be significant in a larger sample. Since this study has an exploratory character, a sample size of 30 to 40 participants per condition was regarded as sufficient (Hertzog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>). Our sample size was comparable to that of other intervention studies in adults with ASD (Sizoo and Kuiper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>; Spek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>). Another limitation of the study is that generalization towards the global population might be limited due to lack of ethnic diversity in the sample and exclusion of institutionalized persons, individuals with intellectual disability, and individuals with a fear of dogs.</p><p id="Par45">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial that demonstrated benefits of an intervention involving therapy dogs in adults with ASD. Because of its clinically relevant effects and remarkable adherence, AAT can be regarded as a promising therapy for stress-related outcomes in this population. More research is needed on the effects of AAT in the ASD population and with larger sample sizes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>We would like to thank the Dutch service dog foundation Stichting Hulphond Nederland and the volunteers for their contribution.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>CW conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination and drafted the manuscript; RL performed the statistical analysis and participated in interpretation of the data and helped to draft the manuscript; AS en ME participated in the design of the study and helped to draft the manuscript.
