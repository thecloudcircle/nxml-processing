IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) and/or p300 are core factors that participate in transcriptional complex formation in the nucleus. In general, cells balance the production of IFNs through suppressive and stimulative mechanisms, but viral infections can disrupt such equilibrium. This study determined that H5N1 viral infection reduced the distribution of human argonaute 2 (AGO2) in A549 cell nucleus. AGO2 did not block phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding ability of IRF3 but inhibited its association with CBP. Therefore, this newly revealed mechanism shows that cellular response leads to transfer of AGO2 from cell nucleus and promotes IFN-&#x003b2; expression to increase host survival during viral infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AGO2</kwd><kwd>negative regulation</kwd><kwd>type I interferon</kwd><kwd>IRF3</kwd><kwd>CBP/p300</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="8631"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viral infection results in activation of innate and multistep immune responses. These responses require recognition of viral infections, activation of multiple signal transduction cascades, and transcription of antiviral genes (Akira et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Katze et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Goubau et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Interferon beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) is one of the most important proteins and is a critical component of innate immune response; most cells of the body secrete this type of molecule (Akira et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ivashkiv and Donlin, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). During cell infection, viruses are recognized by intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include Toll-like receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain like receptors. PRRs activate innate immune signaling pathways and increase activities of transcription factors (Akira et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gilliet et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Chiang et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wu and Chen, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These transcription factors include IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor kappa B, activator protein 1, and the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) and/or p300. Together, these transcription factors can form complexes that bind to regulatory domains of the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter and induce transcription of IFN-&#x003b2; (Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Gough et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ivashkiv and Donlin, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>IFN-&#x003b2; is tightly regulated in many ways, and its aberrant secretion can trigger diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Regulation of IRF3, a key protein in the IFN-&#x003b2; pathway, includes important positive and negative mechanisms (Gonzalez-Navajas et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ivashkiv and Donlin, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The positive mechanisms comprise increased expression and activation of IRF3, and the negative ones involves its decreased expression and inactivation (Servant et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Meng et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). IFN-&#x003b2; expression is also regulated by formation of a transcriptional complex containing IRF3 and CBP/p300 (Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Servant et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>IRF3 is the most important factor in regulation of viral induced IFN-&#x003b2; activation. In general, IRF3 is found in the cytoplasm in latent form (Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). When viruses expose pathogen-associated molecular patterns and are recognized by PRRs, IRF3 is activated to promote antivirus reaction (Akira et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chiang et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ivashkiv and Donlin, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Activation of IRF3 includes C-terminal region phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus (Servant et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Studies extensively investigated the mechanisms underlying phosphorylation-induced activation of IRF3 (Lin et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Servant et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mori et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Clement et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Takahasi et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). IRF3 is phosphorylated on multiple phosphorylation acceptor (phospho-acceptor) sites. Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of C-terminal phospho-accepter clusters (Ser385-Ser386 and Ser396-Ser398-Ser402-Thr404-Ser405) plays important role in activation of IRF3 (Lin et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Servant et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mori et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Other research also showed that phosphorylation of Ser339 on IRF3 is involved in stabilizing IRF-3, and mutation of Ser339 can abrogate CBP association, and dimerization (Saitoh et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Clement et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, Ser339 mutation does not affect gene transactivation as long as Ser396 is available for phosphorylation (Clement et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Previously published data indicated that Ser386 and Ser396 play important roles in IRF3 activity, and Ser339 is not integrant under physiological conditions.</p><p>Transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300 are critical regulators of metazoan gene expression (Lin et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Suhara et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Transcriptional coactivators associate with different DNA-bound transcription factors through small conserved domains (Lin et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). A compactly folded 46-residue domain in CBP serves as the IRF3 binding domain (IBiD), and interaction occurs at the C terminus domain of IRF3 (Lin et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Activated IRF3 interacts with coactivator CBP/p300 and initiates transcription of IFN-&#x003b2; (Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Suhara et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Reily et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Phosphorylation at Ser386 and Ser396 plays significant roles in IRF3 activation and its interaction with CBP (Chen et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Takahasi et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Following phosphorylation and dimerization, IRF3 translocates to the nucleus and recruits CBP and/or p300 for full activation (Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Suhara et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Song et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Then, this complex binds to PRD I/III in the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter for transcription activation and IFN-&#x003b2; production (Weaver et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p><p>Human argonaute 2 (AGO2) is a multifunctional protein that interact with many molecules (Hock and Meister, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Martinez and Gregory, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Recent studies on the structure of AGO2 have revealed the four core domains including N domain, PAZ domain, MID domain, and PIWI domain (Kuhn and Joshua-Tor, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ye et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). AGO2 is a key regulator and activator that performs specific siRNA/miRNA-dependent and -independent functions. This protein also interacts with Dicer, TAR RNA binfing protein (TRBP) and PACT, which are required to construct the RNA-induced silencing complex-loading complex and to process precursor miRNAs into mature miRNAs (Chendrimada et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Martinez and Gregory, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ye et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). AGO2 also inhibits translation initiation via interaction with eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6) and prevents recruitment of the translation initiation factor eIF4-E by binding to 7-methylguanosine cap (Chendrimada et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kiriakidou et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). AGO2 binds to AU element of 3'-untranslated region of TNF (i.e., TNF-alpha) mRNA and upregulates translation under serum starvation (Vasudevan and Steitz, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). AGO2 is also normally located on euchromatin instead of heterochromatin, and once combined with CTCF/CP190, it can inhibit related target gene expression through CTCF/CP190-dependent Fab-8 insulation (Moshkovich et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Studies on cellular functions of AGO2 should thus be continued.</p><p>Previous studies showed that the proteins associated with RNA interference (RNAi) pathway may influence viral replication. For instance, PACT enhances the function of RIG-I, and TRBP influences PKR, these phenomena can affect innate immunity and viral proliferation (Cosentino et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Kok et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Kim et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Dicer functions as effector and sensor by cleaving viral double-stranded RNAs and by activating downstream signaling or effector systems that generate relatively more robust and amplified antiviral responses (Ahmad and Hur, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Dicer also reduces influenza viral replication, which is siRNA/miRNA independent (Matskevich and Moelling, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This study further investigated AGO2 function during viral infection. This study reveals that AGO2 participates in negative regulation of IFN-&#x003b2; signaling pathway in a novel manner, inhibiting formation of transcription initiation complex and consequent IFN-&#x003b2; production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAN biotech, Auckland, New Zealand) and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C.

First, siRNA was designed against the human AGO2, and siAGO2 knockdown efficiency was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Then, A549 cells were transfected with siAGO2 or nonspecific control siRNA (siNC) and infected with H5N1 after 48 h. At 24 h post infection (h.p.i.), viral NP gene mRNA levels and viral titers were evaluated in H5N1 virus infected A549 cells. NP gene mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the siAGO2 group compared with that in control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Viral titer in siAGO2-treated cells was determined with TCID<sub>50</sub> assay, and the obtained value was also lower than that of siNC-treated cells at 24 h.p.i. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These results indicated that AGO2 knockdown inhibited replication of H5N1 virus. The effect of AGO2 overexpression on viral replication was also determined by transfecting A549 cells with HA-AGO2. Efficacy of AGO2 overexpression was determined by western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). As determined by TCID<sub>50</sub> assay, AGO2-overexpressing groups yielded higher NP gene mRNA level and virus titer than the control group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E,F</xref>).

AGO2 also regulates multiple biological functions through protein&#x02013;protein, protein&#x02013;RNA, or protein&#x02013;DNA interactions (Martinez and Gregory, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Meister, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ye et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Together with AGO2, SETDB1 plays an essential role in transcriptional gene silencing through recruitment of chromatin remodelers and/or other modifiers, consequently creating a repressive chromatin milieu at targeted promoters (Cho et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). AGO2 can directly bind to the promoter of focal adhesion kinase, which is a critical molecule associated with tumor metastasis, and can trigger its transcription (Cheng et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). AGO2 also acts as an RNA slicer independent of dicer and as regulator of miRNA maturation (Cifuentes et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ye et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Previous studies showed that AGO2 can enhance miRNA stability (Winter and Diederichs, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ye et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The functions of AGO2 remain to be understood. Initial discoveries indicated that this protein may participate in viral replication and type I IFN production in cells.</p><p>This study, investigated the influence of AGO2 on virus proliferation. Results showed that knockdown of AGO2 expression inhibited H5N1 virus replication, whereas its overexpression resulted in the opposite phenomenon (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C,E,F</xref>). This study also determined that viral infection can modify AGO2 distribution between cytoplasm and cell nucleus, and that it may influence virus/host interactions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Therefore, AGO2 can directly influence innate immune responses and type I IFN signaling pathway. AGO2 was silenced, and expression level of ISGs and IFN-&#x003b2; were detected to investigate this hypothesis. Results indicated that silencing of AGO2 promoted SeV induced expression levels of endogenous IFN-&#x003b2;, downstream IFIT1, and ISGs including Mx1, STAT1, and ISG15 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The overexpression experiment involving A549 cells and double fluorescence reporting system in HEK293T cells also yielded the same results (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;D</xref>). The targets of AGO2 inhibition in type I IFN signaling pathway were explored using double fluorescence reporting system in HEK293T cells. Notably, AGO2 suppressed activation of IFN-&#x003b2; promoter, this action was mediated by overexpressions of RIG-I, RIG-I-N, VISA, TBK-1, IRF3, and IRF3-5D (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results indicated that AGO2 targeted at or downstream of IRF3 and negatively regulated activation of IFN-&#x003b2; signaling.</p><p>Previous studies illustrated that activation of IRF3 is a key step for activation of IFN-&#x003b2; signaling; IRF3 activation consists of phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus (Servant et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Takahasi et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Only phosphorylated IRF3 can dimerize and translocate to the nucleus (Lin et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The most critical steps comprise phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Thus, the effects of AGO2 on phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were analyzed using Western blot. Results proved that AGO2 did not prevent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref>). Ser339 also affects stability of IRF3 (Saitoh et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Clement et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Total IRF3 was also detected by western blot, and results showed that total IRF3 did not affected stability of IRF3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Binding of IRF3 to ISRE is also an important procedure, and DNA binding assay was performed (Ysebrant de Lendonck et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Meng et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Results indicated that AGO2 did not interfere with DNA binding ability of IRF3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). All results illustrated that AGO2 did not influence activation and DNA binding ability of IRF3.</p><p>Transcriptional coactivators associate with promoters and enhancers primarily through protein&#x02013;protein contact, and mediate interactions between DNA-bound transcription factors and the general transcription machinery (Torchia et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Gusterson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Tsuda et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300 are highly homologous and are critical regulators of metazoan gene expression, and interaction between IRF3 and CBP/p300 play a significant role in transcriptional complex formation (Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Suhara et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). CBP/p300 associates with many different DNA-bound transcription factors through small, conserved domains. A previous study identified a compactly folded 46-residue domain (IBiD) in CBP/p300 that can interact with IRF3 at C terminal. IBiD is required for viral induction of IFN-&#x003b2;, and IBiD mutation causes loss of structural integrity of CBP/p300 (Lin et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>As AGO2 did not affect activation and DNA binding ability of IRF3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), interfering the formation of transcriptional complex which includes the interaction between IRF3 and CBP/p300, bear significance (Yoneyama et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Lin et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were conducted to understand the mechanisms underlying how AGO2 negatively regulates activation of IFN-&#x003b2; signaling target at or downstream of IRF3. Results showed that AGO2 can interact with IRF3 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A&#x02013;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B</xref>). Then, Flag-IRF3(1&#x02013;197), which contains a DBD, and Flag-IRF3(198&#x02013;427), which contains an IAD domain, were constructed. Each domain was cotransfected with HA-AGO2 in HEK293T cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed. The results indicated that AGO2 interacted with the IRF3 IAD while interacting with the domain associated with IBiD; AGO2 was speculated to interact with IRF3 to reduce IBiD&#x02013;IRF3 binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Based on this assumption, Myc-IBiD was constructed and transfected with IRF3 in the absence or presence of HA-AGO2 expressing plasmid. Interaction between IRF3 and IBiD was detected by immunoprecipitation. The data showed that IBiD was dislodged from IRF3 as AGO2 was increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A</xref>). Interaction between IRF3/IRF3-5D and endogenous CBP was also detected in the absence or presence of HA-AGO2 expressing plasmid, further proving that AGO2 interfered with the interaction between IRF3 and CBP/p300 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10B</xref>). Therefore, AGO2 sequestered the interaction between IRF3 and CBP/p300. AGO2 contains four domain which is N domain, PAZ domain, MID domain, and PIWI domain (Kuhn and Joshua-Tor, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We funded that MID domain interact with IRF3 and the deletion of MID domain could not abrogate interaction between IRF3 and CBP (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A,B</xref>). The competition binding essay also showed that AGO2-MIDdel could not hinder CBP/p300 binding to IRF3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11C</xref>). This study provides insight into mechanisms underlying antagonism of IFN by AGO2.</p><p>This study, proposed a model in which virus-inducible activation of IRF3 interacts with coactivator CBP/p300 and permits IRF3 primary activation of IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b2; responsive genes. This study also showed that AGO2 serves as a negative regulator, which suppresses IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b2; responsive genes by disturbing IRF3 binding to CBP/p300, and that the interaction between IRF3 and AGO2 poses no influence on IRF3 DNA binding capacity. H5N1 can induce IFN-&#x003b2; expression by decreasing nuclear AGO2 protein, which can inhibit IFN-&#x003b2; expression in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>).</p><fig id="F12" position="float"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagram of AGO2 action on innate immune signaling pathway</bold>. Viral infection recruits kinases TBK-1 and IKK&#x003b5; to adaptor protein VISA and TRIF. These kinases phosphorylate IRF3, and phosphorylated IRF3 forms dimers that translocate into the nucleus and are activated. Activated IRF3 interacts with CBP/p300, which forms the transcription initiation complex, and induces production of IFN-&#x003b2;. However, AGO2 inhibits IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activation by interfering with IRF3&#x02013;CBP interaction and represses formation of transcription initiation complex. H5N1 infection can reduce the distribution of AGO2 in the nucleus and further enhance IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fcimb-07-00195-g0012"/></fig><p>AGO2 is a potential novel factor that maintains balance of in virus-induced type I IFN signaling pathway. This study also proposed a theory that cells can downregulate AGO2 content in the nucleus when stimulated by viruses, to induce inhibitory effects of AGO2 on IFN-&#x003b2; expression and upregulate expression of IFN-&#x003b2;. Then, viruses can take advantage of inhibitory mechanisms of AGO2 to further propagate in cells. Previous studies showed that AGO2 and RNAi factors Dicer, TRBP, and TRNC6A/GW182 are located in the nucleus and associate together in multiprotein complexes (Gagnon et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). IPM8 is a regulator of AGO2, and knockdown of IPM8 reduces the nuclear AGO2 pool (Weinmann et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The subcellular distribution of AGO2 during H5N1 infection depends on RNAi factors (Dicer, TRBP, and TRNC6A/GW182), IPM8 or other mechanisms, which should be further investigated. The proposed theory come and the observed phenomena will benefit prevention of virus infection.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>MJ, HC, and SW conceived and designed the experiments; SW, XinS, CY, and DZ performed the experiments.
