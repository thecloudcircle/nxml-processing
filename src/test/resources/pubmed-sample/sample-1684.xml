It attracts tremendous attention of cancer researchers because of its extremely high mortality rate. Recent studies have indicated that traditional herbal medicines (THMs) can play a pivotal role in cancer prevention and treatment. THMs are gaining popularity as a source of anti&#x02010;cancer agents. The plant of <italic>Balanophora polyandra</italic>, which has been used as a traditional herbal medicine, has been known for exhibiting potential haemostatic, analgesic, anti&#x02010;inflammatory and anti&#x02010;cancer properties. However, few studies on inhibitory effect of <italic>B. polyandra</italic> on OC have been performed. In the present study, we found that <italic>B. polyandra</italic> polysaccharides (BPP) induced cell cycle arrest at S phase, triggered apoptosis and inhibited migration and invasion of OC cells. Furthermore, we also found that there was a potential and close relationship between BPP and P53&#x02010;mediated pathway. Overall, these findings suggest that BPP can be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of OC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd id="jcmm15468-kwd-0001">apoptosis</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15468-kwd-0002"><italic>Balanophora polyandra</italic></kwd><kwd id="jcmm15468-kwd-0003">cell cycle arrest</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15468-kwd-0004">migration and invasion</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15468-kwd-0005">ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15468-kwd-0006">P53</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source>Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy Key Laboratory of Hubei province in China</funding-source><award-id>2019KZL09</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-0002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China </institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81773959</award-id><award-id>81974528</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-0003"><funding-source>Health commission of Hubei Province scientific research project in China</funding-source><award-id>WJ2019H527</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="5822"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>July 2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:5.8.5 mode:remove_FC converted:10.07.2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

</xref> its survival rates are still low, partly because of its resistance to the currently existing therapies. About 75% of patients with OC responded well to the standard first&#x02010;line chemotherapy treatment, but soon OC usually returns and develops resistance to the previous chemotherapy agents. Therefore, discovery and development of new anti&#x02010;OC therapeutic agents is urgently and highly demanded for improving the clinical outcome.</p><p>Traditional herbal medicines (THMs) have been applied as the important components of complementary and alternative medicine.

<italic>Balanophora polyandra</italic> (<italic>B. polyandra</italic>), belonging to the family Balanophoraceae, is a native parasitic plant that grows on the root system of various hosts, especially the evergreen vine shrubs in south&#x02010;west of China.<xref rid="jcmm15468-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">

</xref> It has been traditionally used as a medicinal plant for treatment of various diseases, including haemorrhoids, metrorrhagia, stomach ache and hemoptysis. Phytochemical studies on the whole plant of <italic>B. polyandra</italic> have reported the presence of hydrolysable tannins, particularly the ellagitannins, which are considered to be the characteristic components in genus Balanophora.<xref rid="jcmm15468-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">

</xref> Previous studies have revealed that the polysaccharides derived from <italic>B. polyandra</italic> possessed anti&#x02010;fatigue, antioxidant and hypoglycaemic activities, whereas the polysaccharides from B. spicata could efficiently inhibit the growth of the implanted S180 tumour.<xref rid="jcmm15468-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">

</xref> However, there have been no studies on its roles in other types of cancers, such as OC, and the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Herein, we assessed how <italic>B. polyandra</italic> polysaccharides (BPP) inhibit the growth of OC cells. We found that BPP was significantly related with proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, invasion and migration of OC cells. Moreover, we gained some insight into the mechanisms by which BPP inhibits the proliferation of OC cells. We also found that P53 pathway was involved in the induction of the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. These findings suggest that BPP can have the potential to inhibit OC progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="jcmm15468-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="jcmm15468-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Cells culture</title><p>Two human ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780 and OVSAHO, came from Cell Resource Center of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (Shanghai, China).

However, at the present, there have been no reports on the treatment of ovarian cancer with BPP. Herein, we reported for the first time that BPP has an inhibitory effect on the growth of OC cells and xenograft tumours in a dose&#x02010;dependent manner. In addition, BPP can inhibit cell invasion and migration, induce cancer cell apoptosis and block cell cycle, which might be resulted from the BPP multiple targets of complex diseases, including ovarian cancer.</p><p>To investigate the influence of BPP on the invasion and migration of OC cells, the wound healing assay and migration assay were used to observe the changes of the migration and invasion of OC cells under the action of BPP, respectively. Because the results of MTT experiment showed that when the BPP concentration was above 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/Ml, the cell survival rate of OC cells is &#x0003c;80% at 48&#x000a0;hours.

It is hopeful to explore a new direction for the development and application of anti&#x02010;cancer drugs for clinical ovarian cancer by taking the advantages of BPP, such as multi&#x02010;target, lower toxicity and fewer side effects.
