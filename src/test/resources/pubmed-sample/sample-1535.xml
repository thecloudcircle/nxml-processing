<article-title>Ovarian Cancer: A Clinical Challenge That Needs Some Basic Answers</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><sec id="st1"><title>Background</title><p>Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis due to advanced stage at presentation and either intrinsic or acquired resistance to classic cytotoxic drugs such as platinum and taxoids. Recent large clinical trials with different combinations and sequences of classic cytotoxic drugs indicate that further significant improvement in prognosis by this type of drugs is not to be expected. Currently a large number of drugs, targeting dysregulated molecular pathways in cancer cells have been developed and are introduced in the clinic. A major challenge is to identify those patients who will benefit from drugs targeting these specific dysregulated pathways.The aims of our study were (1) to develop a gene expression profile associated with overall survival in advanced stage serous ovarian cancer, (2) to assess the association of pathways and transcription factors with overall survival, and (3) to validate our identified profile and pathways/transcription factors in an independent set of ovarian cancers.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>According to a randomized design, profiling of 157 advanced stage serous ovarian cancers was performed in duplicate using &#x0223c;35,000 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays. A continuous predictor of overall survival was built taking into account well-known issues in microarray analysis, such as multiple testing and overfitting. A functional class scoring analysis was utilized to assess pathways/transcription factors for their association with overall survival. The prognostic value of genes that constitute our overall survival profile was validated on a fully independent, publicly available dataset of 118 well-defined primary serous ovarian cancers. Furthermore, functional class scoring analysis was also performed on this independent dataset to assess the similarities with results from our own dataset. An 86-gene overall survival profile discriminated between patients with unfavorable and favorable prognosis (median survival, 19 versus 41 mo, respectively; permutation <italic>p</italic>-value of log-rank statistic = 0.015) and maintained its independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. Genes that composed the overall survival profile were also able to discriminate between the two risk groups in the independent dataset. In our dataset 17/167 pathways and 13/111 transcription factors were associated with overall survival, of which 16 and 12, respectively, were confirmed in the independent dataset.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study provides new clues to genes, pathways, and transcription factors that contribute to the clinical outcome of serous ovarian cancer and might be exploited in designing new treatment strategies.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Ate van der Zee and colleagues analyze the gene expression profiles of ovarian cancer samples from 157 patients, and identify an 86-gene expression profile that seems to predict overall survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Ovarian cancer kills more than 100,000 women every year and is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in women in Western countries. Most ovarian cancers develop when an epithelial cell in one of the ovaries (two small organs in the pelvis that produce eggs) acquires genetic changes that allow it to grow uncontrollably and to spread around the body (metastasize). In its early stages, ovarian cancer is confined to the ovaries and can often be treated successfully by surgery alone. Unfortunately, early ovarian cancer rarely has symptoms so a third of women with ovarian cancer have advanced disease when they first visit their doctor with symptoms that include vague abdominal pains and mild digestive disturbances. That is, cancer cells have spread into their abdominal cavity and metastasized to other parts of the body (so-called stage III and IV disease). The outlook for women diagnosed with stage III and IV disease, which are treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, is very poor. Only 30&#x00025; of women with stage III, and 5&#x00025; with stage IV, are still alive five years after their cancer is diagnosed.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>If the cellular pathways that determine the biological behavior of ovarian cancer could be identified, it might be possible to develop more effective treatments for women with stage III and IV disease. One way to identify these pathways is to use gene expression profiling (a technique that catalogs all the genes expressed by a cell) to compare gene expression patterns in the ovarian cancers of women who survive for different lengths of time. Genes with different expression levels in tumors with different outcomes could be targets for new treatments. For example, it might be worth developing inhibitors of proteins whose expression is greatest in tumors with short survival times. In this study, the researchers develop an expression profile that is associated with overall survival in advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer (more than half of ovarian cancers originate in serous cells, epithelial cells that secrete a watery fluid). The researchers also assess the association of various cellular pathways and transcription factors (proteins that control the expression of other proteins) with survival in this type of ovarian carcinoma.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers analyzed the gene expression profiles of tumor samples taken from 157 patients with advanced stage serous ovarian cancer and used the &#x0201c;supervised principal components&#x0201d; method to build a predictor of overall survival from these profiles and patient survival times. This 86-gene predictor discriminated between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes (average survival times of 41 and 19 months, respectively). It also discriminated between groups of patients with these two outcomes in an independent dataset collected from 118 additional serous ovarian cancers. Next, the researchers used &#x0201c;functional class scoring&#x0201d; analysis to assess the association between pathway and transcription factor expression in the tumor samples and overall survival. Seventeen of 167 KEGG pathways (&#x0201c;wiring&#x0201d; diagrams of molecular interactions, reactions and relations involved in cellular processes and human diseases listed in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were associated with survival, 16 of which were confirmed in the independent dataset. Finally, 13 of 111 analyzed transcription factors were associated with overall survival in the tumor samples, 12 of which were confirmed in the independent dataset.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings identify an 86-gene overall survival gene expression profile that seems to predict overall survival for women with advanced serous ovarian cancer. However, before this profile can be used clinically, further validation of the profile and more robust methods for determining gene expression profiles are needed. Importantly, these findings also provide new clues about the genes, pathways and transcription factors that contribute to the clinical outcome of serous ovarian cancer, clues that can now be exploited in the search for new treatment strategies. Finally, these findings suggest that it might eventually be possible to tailor therapies to the needs of individual patients by analyzing which pathways are activated in their tumors and thus improve survival times for women with advanced ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000024">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000024</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study is further discussed in a <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic>

All patients were treated according to Dutch guidelines, which are based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Standard treatment included cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy (in combination with paclitaxel after 1996). For follow-up, patients were seen every 3 mo for the first 2 y. Thereafter, follow-up visits had an interval of 4 mo in the third year, 6 mo in the fourth and fifth year, and once a year in the sixth to tenth year. A follow-up visit comprised a general physical and gynecologic examination. CA125 serum levels were also routinely determined.</p><p>Overall survival was calculated from the date of primary surgery to the date of last follow-up (right-censored) or to the date of death due to ovarian cancer. Patients who died from intercurrent disease were right-censored at the time of death. All tumor samples were obtained at primary surgery prior to chemotherapy, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. Samples were confirmed to comprise tumor cells (median percentage tumor cells: 70&#x00025;, interquartile range: 50&#x00025;&#x02013;80&#x00025;), as examined after hematoxylin and eosin staining of frozen sections. Patients gave informed consent for collection and storage of tissue samples in a tissue bank for future research. All relevant patient data were retrieved and transferred into an anonymous, password-protected, database. The patients' identity was protected by study-specific, unique patient codes and their true identity was only known to two dedicated data managers. According to Dutch regulations, these precautions meant no further institutional review board approval was needed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.federa.org/">http://www.federa.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>RNA Extraction and Amplification</title><p>Total RNA from tumor samples was subjected to cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands).

Because each tumor sample was profiled once with Cy5 and once with Cy3, there was one replicate of the whole experiment. Samples were hybridized according to a randomized design (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-1000024-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) to prevent systematic biases such as those caused by batch effects or technical variation that can be introduced during labeling, hybridization, and scanning [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

It has been shown that the most significant principal component for a gene expression data matrix is frequently a constant pattern, which dominates the data [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. So, the first principal component explaining the largest part of the variation could be considered variation that the arrays have in common [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Next, correlation with the first principal component was calculated for each individual array (factor loading). Factor loadings of the first principal component for an individual array can be seen as a quality index, as arrays of lesser quality would have lower or distinctly different correlations than arrays of good quality. Samples with a factor loading with the first principal components of less than 2 times the standard deviation from the mean were excluded as their hybridizations were considered to be of low quality [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Operon V3.0 probe identifiers (&#x0223c;35,000) were converted to official gene symbols using probe annotations provided by The Netherlands Cancer Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microarrays.nki.nl//download/files/operon_hs_060614.xls">http://microarrays.nki.nl//download/files/operon_hs_060614.xls</ext-link>).

The significance of each gene was measured based on a univariate Cox proportional hazards regression of survival time versus the log expression level. Next, PCA was performed to reduce the dimensionality of this selected subset of genes. Principal components (PCs), which are linear additions of weighted gene expression signals, were constructed in such a way that the first PC explained the largest amount of variance in our dataset and each subsequent PC explained the largest amount of the remaining variance while remaining uncorrelated with the previously constructed PC. Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to the data (with 10&#x00025; of cases omitted) using the first five PCs as predictor variables, providing a regression coefficient (weight) for each principal component. The regression coefficients in combination with the first five PCs were used to calculate the predictive index for each sample. The 10&#x00025; omitted test cases were classified as high or low risk based on whether their predictive index was above or below the median of the predictive indices for the 90&#x00025; of cases in the training set. This entire procedure was repeated, leaving out a different 10&#x00025; of cases until each case had been omitted exactly once and the cross-validated risk groups were determined for all cases. So the cross-validated risk group for each case was determined based on a predictor model that did not use that case in any way in its construction.</p><p>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for the predicted overall survival risk classes (high or low) giving a fair representation of the value of the expression profiles for predicting overall survival risk and the log-rank statistic was computed. To assess the significance of the log-rank statistic and the degree of overfitting, a phenotype permutation test based on 1,000 permutations was performed [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Survival data were randomly shuffled among the cases and the entire cross-validation process described above was repeated. For each random reshuffling, the process was repeated, new cross-validated Kaplan-Meier survival curves created, and the log-rank statistic for the random shuffling was computed, providing a null-distribution of the log-rank statistic. The tail area of this null distribution beyond the log-rank statistic obtained from the real data was the permutation significance level for testing the null hypothesis of no relation between the expression data and overall survival.

Our overall survival profile maintained independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. Moreover, expression of the genes that composed our overall survival profile also held their prognostic value in an independent dataset processed at a different institution using a different microarray platform. Finally, in addition to individual genes, we were also able to reproducibly identify and validate KEGG pathways and TRED transcription factors associated with overall survival.</p><p>Limited overlap with respect to individual genes, as observed in comparable studies in other tumor types, was also found between our overall survival profile and those reported in three previous ovarian cancer microarray studies [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Nonreproducibility of prognostic profiles between different microarray studies in the same tumor type can be attributed to a variety of methodological issues [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our study specifically pays attention to methodological principles such as randomization and replication. Thus, confounding effects are avoided and unbiased estimation of differential expression levels is provided. The three studies mentioned above did not include a replication of the experiment [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast to these studies, by using supervised PCA to build prognostic profiles, we could consider survival a continuous parameter, and patients were thus not forced into subgroups that might not be biologically meaningful. Categorizing patients a priori into a &#x0201c;low risk&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; subgroup based on survival times might cause any future predictions based on this model to be suspect when underlying, unidentified, biologically different subgroups have considerable overlap in survival times.</p><p>Our overall survival profile contains several interesting genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1000024-t002">Table 2</xref>) that offer potential insight into mechanisms associated with tumor behavior. The overall validity of our approach is confirmed by the observation that for some of the genes in our profile, earlier studies that utilized non&#x02013;array-based methodologies already indicated their relevance in ovarian cancer. For example, high expression of the proapoptotic <italic>BAX</italic> gene was associated with improved prognosis in our study. Previously, a similar relation between <italic>BAX</italic> expression and response to chemotherapy and overall survival in ovarian cancer was reported by others [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Likewise, in our study, high expression of Ras inhibitor 1 (<italic>RIN1</italic>) and low expression of Ras-like without CAAX1 (<italic>RIT1</italic>) were associated with better overall survival, which is in agreement with previous work by others showing that activated Ras contributes to the maintenance and growth of ovarian carcinomas [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition to these already known relevant genes in ovarian cancer our study reveals also multiple new genes with a possible impact on tumor behavior in ovarian cancer. For example <italic>OSM</italic>, <italic>JAK2</italic>, and <italic>CNTFR</italic> are components of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway, which can stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, cell migration, and apoptosis [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. <italic>OSM</italic> has individually been identified as a potent suppressor of tumor cell proliferation and inducer of differentiation in multiple tissues [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. <italic>FGFBP1</italic> and <italic>FGFR1</italic> interact with fibroblast growth factors <italic>FGF1</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic>, and it has been suggested that the fibroblast growth factors could serve as the angiogenic switch in human cancer [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Apart from having prognostic impact our analysis also sheds light on previous unknown possible &#x0201c;druggable&#x0201d; targets in ovarian cancer; <italic>FKBP7,</italic> with the highest hazard ratio for individual genes in our study, appears to be especially of interest because FKBPs can be targeted with mTOR inhibitors [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Although individual genes such as those described above may prove to be relevant for tumor behavior, it is often not known in ovarian and other cancers whether large fold-changes in individual genes will have more biological relevance than will smaller but coordinated fold-changes in a set of genes along a single pathway. Analysis of our microarray data by integration of genes into functional gene sets according to well-known biological pathways and transcription factors enabled us to consider all available genomic information rather than only genes passing a certain significance threshold, thus providing extra clues to which signaling pathways and transcription factors contribute to the clinical outcome of ovarian cancer. Bonome et al. [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] recently also identified possible signaling events (pathways). However, by using classical over-representation analysis of functional gene sets within only a small subset of genes (57 probes) associated with overall survival, the authors disregarded most of the genomic information available [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Our pathway analysis, which to our knowledge has not been applied to ovarian cancer array datasets previously, revealed 17 pathways to be related to survival, of which 16 were validated in the independent dataset. As previously mentioned, there is usually only limited overlap with respect to individual genes between the prognostic profiles previously published in (ovarian) cancer [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In contrast, integrating genes in functional gene sets according to pathways and transcription factors in this study resulted in considerable overlap between our dataset and the independent dataset with respect to prognostic impact. Our results therefore indicate that assessment of prognostic profiles is more robust by determination of coordinated expression of several signaling pathways than of expression of individual genes.</p><p>Thus in the present study, cell cycle, Wnt, Jak-STAT, and MAPK pathways, playing a role in apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and/or cell cycle, were identified as having a role in ovarian cancer; consistent with these results, aberrant signaling of each of these pathways has been proposed as contributing to ovarian carcinogenesis [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], again indicating the strength of our approach. Novel therapeutic options are currently being explored that act on several signaling pathways that we found to be associated with overall survival in ovarian cancer. For example, Basica et al. recently described activation of Wnt signaling in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines and showed that Wnt antagonists dramatically altered the biological behavior of these cells [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A blocking antibody against FZD10, a cell membrane receptor for Wnt, was shown to have strong antitumor effect in xenografted tumors overexpressing FZD10 [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As in our study, a dysregulated Wnt pathway and, more specifically, overexpression of FZD10 and FZD7 (another member of the Wnt cell-surface receptor family) were related to worse prognosis, so this FZD10 blocking antibody may have clinical potential by inhibiting the autocrine Wnt signalling pathway in ovarian cancer.</p><p>Our transcription factor analysis also implicated several transcription factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1000024-t005">Table 5</xref>) in ovarian cancer. With different methodologies A2P-2alpha and c-Ets-1 have previously been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Similarly, E2F transcription factors, members of the C/EBP family, and CREB were demonstrated to play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. With the exception of p53, most transcription factors are presently difficult to target. Our transcription factor analysis demonstrated a positive prognostic impact for p53 as an &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; transcription factor. In tumor cell lines activation of wild-type p53 can be induced by the small molecule nutlin-3, which antagonizes the function of the natural inhibitor of wild-type p53 MDM2, resulting in enhanced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In combination, these observations tempt one to speculate on a possible role for nutlin-3 in overcoming resistance to chemotherapy, especially in those ovarian cancers with a less activated p53 [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>A limitation of functional gene set enrichment analysis as performed in our study, however, is its inability to assess the activation status of identified pathways in an individual tumor sample. This gap is potentially filled by the strategy described by Dressman et al. [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Bild et al. [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>: Oncogenic pathway activation analysis). In this study we assessed the activation status of five oncogenic signaling pathways in 157 ovarian tumor samples based on the activation observed in a mammalian cell line following tranfection of adenovirus expressing human c-Myc, activated H-Ras, human c-Src, human E2F3, or &#x003b2;-catenin. Bild et al. showed in a series of 153 samples that activated E2F3, &#x003b2;-catenin, and c-Src pathways were associated with poor overall survival in ovarian cancer [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. None of these five oncogenic pathways showed a significant association (as individual pathways and/or in combination) with overall survival in our dataset (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-1000024-sg003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-1000024-sg004">S4</xref>). Our results therefore indicate that analysis of pathway activation status until now is not very robust and cannot be easily exchanged between different studies, as was recently also described by others [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>In this study the prognostic impact of 57 genes from our profile was validated within the independent dataset from Dressman et al. [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], providing stronger evidence than before that these genes are important in the biological behavior of ovarian tumors. Platform differences did not allow one-to-one exact validation of the underlying predictive algorithm. Therefore, the clinical usefulness of our overall survival predictor needs further validation. With regard to the reproducibility issues between different microarray platforms, it seems likely that in the future an array-based prognostic tool will be based on a single platform. So, our study might be considered a phase II study in which we constructed a genetic profile associated with overall survival within the whole group of 157 patients according to statistical principles such as cross-validation and permutation testing [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. As described above, such a study provides valuable clues about the mechanisms underlying tumor behavior and clues with respect to potential drug development targets (genes, pathways, etc). To further evaluate the prognostic impact of our profile for individual patients, prospective studies need to be performed. Another important issue that needs to be addressed in such studies is the impact of intratumor heterogeneity on reproducibility. Using a combination of microsatellite analysis and SNP analysis Khalique et al. recently showed that intratumor heterogeneity is a common feature within epithelial ovarian cancer [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides new, validated insights into molecular changes in genes, pathways, and transcription factors that are relevant for ovarian cancer behavior and that should therefore be exploited in the search for new treatment strategies towards patient-tailored therapy. In the future, pathway activation analysis in individual tumors may guide the choice of targeting drugs in ovarian cancer patients [<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-1000024-b068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], but its methodology needs to become more robust before clinical relevance can be envisioned.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-1000024-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Diagram Showing the Randomization Design</title><p>(497 KB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000024.sg001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-1000024-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>A Graphical Representation of the Survival Prediction Method</title><p>(2.6 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000024.sg002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-1000024-sg003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><title>Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves for the Five Oncogenic Pathways between the Group of Ovarian Tumor Samples with an Activation Probability <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.5 and the Group with an Activation Probability <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.5</title><p>(1.5 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000024.sg003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-1000024-sg004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves of the Top Two Clusters after Clustering the Samples on their Activation Probabilities for the Five Oncogenic Pathways Combined</title><p>(1 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000024.sg004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-1000024-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Available Clinicopathologic Characteristics of the 118 Patients as Reported by Dressman et al.
