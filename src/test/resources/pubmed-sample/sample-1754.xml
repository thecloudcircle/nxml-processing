However, radioresistance in irradiated tumors can also develop, resulting in relapse. Here we report a mechanism by which extrinsic resistance develops after local ablative radiation that relies on the immunosuppressive action of STING. The STING/type I interferon pathway enhances suppressive inflammation in tumors by recruiting myeloid cells in part via the CCR2 pathway. Germ-line knockouts of CCR2 or treatment with an anti-CCR2 antibody results in blockade of radiation-induced MDSC infiltration. Treatment with anti-CCR2 antibody alleviates immunosuppression following activation of the STING pathway, enhancing the anti-tumor effects of STING agonists and radiotherapy. We propose that radiation-induced STING activation is immunosuppressive due to (monocytic) M-MDSC infiltration, which results in tumor radioresistance. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive effects of radiotherapy and STING agonists can be abrogated in humans by a translational strategy involving anti-CCR2 antibody treatment to improve radiotherapy.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Tumors often develop resistance to radiotherapy.

The anti-tumor response elicited by irradiation (IR) depends on the innate and adaptive immunity of the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> in which type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling play a pivotal role. Following IR, the tumor microenvironment undergoes changes including an increase in DNA damage followed by enhancement of the DNA sensing pathway via cGAS/STING, which leads to an increase in type I interferon production and signaling, and a subsequent, powerful adaptive immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In cellular terms, radioresistance is defined as the doseslope or the survival cure; however, the radioresistance of tumors is multifactorial and may result from intrinsic cellular radioresistance or tumor microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, experimental tumor radioresistance is defined as a comparatively rapid regrowth of tumor or a decrease in the number of tumors expected to be controlled at a specific dose. Radioresistant tumors are a major barrier to successful cancer treatment. For example, in locally advanced lung cancer and non-HPV head and neck cancer, patients who receive radiotherapy fail locally frequently (&#x0003e;50%), likely due to radioresistance, which is determinative in part of treatment success. Recently, radiation has been used in combination with immunotherapy in various clinical trials, predominantly with checkpoint inhibitors to re-invigorate T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Data from pre-clinical models and clinical trials that are underway suggest that activation of the STING-mediated DNA sensing pathway and type I interferon production in combination with radiation and other therapies is an effective approach to cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">However, the roles of type I interferon in tumor immunology could be multi-faceted. Despite the importance of IFN in DC function and T cell priming for initiating anti-tumor host response, it has been noted that chronic interferon exposure can be immunosuppressive in viral infection models in that blockade of type 1 interferon signaling can reduce inflammation caused by infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The negative effect of type I interferon in cancer immunotherapy merits further investigation. We hypothesized that activation of STING by radiation or using STING agonists alone would be a more effective approach when combined with ameliorating the suppressive tumor microenvironment in the host.</p><p id="Par5">Therapeutic radiation leads to injury-like inflammation locally that induces inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> that are anti-tumor in nature but also immunosuppressive. These immunosuppressive pathways include recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and regulatory T cells (Tregs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In mice, MDSCs are identified as monocytic (M-)MDSCs (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>Ly6G<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSCs (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup>), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In some tumor models, M-MDSCs express higher levels of F4/80, CD115, 7/4, and CCR2.</p><p id="Par6">CCR2 is a receptor for monocyte chemoattractant proteins 1, 3, and 5 (CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12) and is expressed on the surface of a subset of M-MDSCs. CCR2 ligands, CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12, are produced by various cell types, including cancer cells. CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells are also important in tissue repair/remodeling due to their vessel-promoting properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. CCR2<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells play a prominent role in tumor cell metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, CCR2<sup>+</sup> M-MDSCs commonly found in various types of cancers can facilitate tumor cell extravasation and metastatic outgrowth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A mouse monoclonal antibody to CCR2 has been developed and has shown excellent efficacy in blocking CCR2<sup>+</sup> cell trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Selective depletion of this specific monocyte subpopulation through engagement of CCR2 by this antibody can reduce central nervous system autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Mouse anti-CCR2 has been evaluated for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases, as well as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. However, the usage of CCR2-depleting antibody has not been previously tested in cancer immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par7">In this report, we demonstrate that MDSC recruitment and tumor radioresistance rely on CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells in the host. Through the use of CCR2 knockout mice or an antibody against mCCR2, we observed that the anti-tumor response as a result of T cell priming was increased in mice treated with radiation, STING agonist, or both. We report for the first time that the STING pathway triggers an influx of MDSCs post-radiation; promoting the level of STING/type I IFN pathway activation also increased MDSC levels. Depletion of CCR2<sup>+</sup>MDSC cells enhanced the therapeutic effect of radiation and a STING agonist, as well as combined radiation plus STING agonist therapy, by decreasing suppression of T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our results suggest that the STING/DNA sensing pathway exerts opposite, immunostimulatory effects followed by compensatory immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. We propose that alleviating suppression as well as promoting T cell priming is equally important to the success of combined radio-immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Monocytic myeloid cells accumulate in irradiated tumors</title><p id="Par8">To investigate the effects of IR on the suppressive immune contexture in a tumor model syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice, we profiled the myeloid cell composition in irradiated MC38 colon tumors. 3 days after treatment with 20&#x02009;Gy, the percentage of monocytic Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> myeloid cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup>) among total hematopoietic cells (CD45<sup>+</sup>) was increased by as much as 3-fold compared to the percentage of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells in tumors of non-irradiated controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0001: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test).

We employed CCR2 germ-line knockout mice to investigate the involvement of CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells in the tumor radiation response. To investigate the monocytic MDSC status in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we profiled the myeloid cell population in MC38 tumors 3 days post IR. We observed that in a MC38 tumor model, the majority of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells are CCR2<sup>+</sup>, in that the baseline level of the CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> population was lower in tumors grown in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with tumors grown in WT mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> levels in tumors of CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>hosts were higher than those in WT hosts, which implies a possible compensatory mechanism in the absence of CCR2 signaling.</p><p id="Par10">We observed significantly enhanced tumor regression of MC38 tumors grown in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts treated by local IR as compared with tumors grown in wild-type (WT) mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Day 31, CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> IR 52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;33 vs. WT IR 351&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;82, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). Irradiation of the tumors grown in a CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host also led to a complete response (rejection rate) of over 60% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), which was not found in irradiated tumors in WT hosts (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). We harvested frozen sections of the tumors grown in WT and CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and stained the vasculature.

This ruled out the possibility that a stronger anti-tumor effect of IR in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was due to poor tumor vasculature. The potential importance of CCR2-expressing cells in radiation therapy is also observed in the Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumor model, where LLC tumors grown in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts showed significant regression post-IR compared to LLC grown in WT mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> IR 228&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;166 vs. WT IR 1300&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;199, day 24, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test).

</p><p id="Par11">To further examine whether the involvement of CCR2-expressing myeloid cells in radioresistance can be translated into a clinically relevant strategy, we attempted to neutralize CCL2 in tumor studies because it is one of the chemokines proposed to attract CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells to tissues and tumors. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> shows that administration anti-CCL2 antibody via intratumoral injection did not enhance the anti-tumor effect of IR. Similar results were found using i.p. administration of anti-CCL2 ab and 20&#x02009;Gy IR in CCL2 knockout hosts and WT mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2D</xref>). Since radiation induces expression in all chemokines (CCL2, CCL7 and CCL12) that are proposed to be ligands of CCR2 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A</xref>), we sought to block the receptor CCR2, which would be an effective translational strategy. Studies using a CCR2 antibody (MC21)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">23</xref></sup> were performed on tumor-bearing WT mice (treatment schedule, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). These experiments also clarified whether the enhanced efficacy of radiation on tumor regression in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was due to a congenic intrinsic development defect in trafficking and maturation of myeloid-derived cells in the knockout mouse. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, treatment with anti-CCR2 antibodies alone had little effect on tumor regression, similar to untreated controls. However, when combined with radiation, anti-CCR2 significantly enhanced the efficacy of tumor regression compared to IR alone (144&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;71 vs. 540&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;151 on day 43, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). 40% of tumors were completely rejected in the IR&#x02009;+&#x02009;anti-CCR2 treatment group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

Here we examined whether monocytic MDSCs might compromise antitumor immunity mediated by the activation of STING, an essential component in host cell DNA sensing and the type I IFN production pathway. We implanted MC38 cancer cells on the flank of WT or STING knockout mice. After 10 days, established tumors received 20&#x02009;Gy and were subjected to flow analysis 3 days later. The baseline levels of monocytic MDSCs in STING<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were similar to those of tumors grown in WT mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). The recruitment of radiation-induced monocytic MDSCs in STING<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was substantially lower than the level in WT mice post-IR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). We hypothesized that when radiation induces expression and activation of the STING pathway, which signals a strong DNA sensing/innate immunity reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, the signal(s) for recruitment of MDSCs is also amplified. Conversely, when STING agonist cGAMP was administered intratumorally, an accumulation of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>, especially CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells, was observed at similar levels as those in irradiated tumors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). STING activation triggers strong T cell priming and adaptive immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> alone and in the context of radiation. To determine whether the resulting adaptive immunity is responsible for MDSC recruitment, we conducted T cell depletion and IFN&#x00263; neutralization studies in which tumors received local IR or cGAMP treatment. The number of CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells was not significantly reduced by the attenuation of adaptive immunity compared to their controls (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A and B</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;

This may due to changes involving other hematopoietic cell types in these tumors. To determine the impact of the STING-DNA sensing pathway on mobilization of monocytic MDSCs in terms of function of the downstream pathway (such as type I IFN signaling), we neutralized receptors of type I IFN using an IFNaR antibody and profiled CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells in established tumors treated with local IR or IR&#x02009;+&#x02009;anti-IFNaR1 antibody. In tumors not treated with IR, anti-IFNaR1 reduced the percentage of CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells compared to controls. While IR induced a robust CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cell accumulation in MC38 tumors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, IR vs. non-IR, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test), blockade of type I IFN signaling abolished the induction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, IR vs. IR&#x02009;+&#x02009;anti-IFNaR1, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01: Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). STING is an essential regulator of IFN production. We propose that STING regulates monocytic MDSC recruitment at least in part through type I IFN signaling. Additionally, IFN&#x003b2; induces expression of CCL2, CCL7 in tumor cells, as well as CCL12 in host cells at the transcription level (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>).

We sought to investigate whether administration of anti-CCR2 further enhances the radiation response of IR&#x02009;+&#x02009;cGAMP by abrogating MDSCs.

In tumor regression studies, triple treatment of anti-CCR2&#x02009;+&#x02009;IR&#x02009;+&#x02009;cGAMP showed superior anti-tumor response compared with treatment with IR alone or IR&#x02009;+&#x02009;cGAMP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par18">Recent advances in the effort to increase cures by radiotherapy have recognized the importance of the immune system as central to these strategies. In addition to promoting T cell priming, radiation induces recruitment of suppressive immune cells such as MDSCs and Tregs into the tumor microenvironment at different time points post treatment. Here we reported that an extrinsic mechanism of tumor radioresistance is regulated by host CCR2<sup>+</sup> M-MDSCs (CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6c<sup>hi</sup>). Employing CCR2 knockout mice or CCR2-depleting antibody, we demonstrated that ameliorating the immunosuppressive effects of radiotherapy can reverse radioresistance. We also proposed that STING/DNA sensing and type I interferon signaling play an important role in recruiting M-MDSCs. Targeting M-MDSCs in combination with radiation and STING agonist treatment further enhanced anti-tumor efficacy by alleviating suppression and reducing Treg occurrence. MDSCs have been linked with tumor metastasis and tumor resistance to treatments including immune checkpoint blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The increased level of MDSCs following SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) might account for the relatively high rate of failure of high-dose ablative radiotherapy, which can be as high as 40% in large tumors. Therefore, thwarting MDSCs from being recruited into tumor immediately following radiation would be not only a very powerful complement to immune checkpoint blockade inhibitor therapy and T cell therapy, but also very effective when combined with radiotherapy. In this context, priming of the immune system can be considered radiosensitization by modifying the host, whereas infiltration of MDSCs can be considered a host adaptation to stress and therefore a new type of radioresistance.</p><p id="Par19">In the CCR2 knockout study, we observed growth acceleration especially in untreated LLC tumors in CCR2 knockout mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Since CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes are absent in the periphery of CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (because they are retained in the bone marrow), we hypothesize that non-MDSC (Ly6C<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes may suppress tumor growth in certain tumor models under basal conditions because these cells may directly attack tumor cells or present tumor antigens to T cells. Because we did not directly observe MDSC mobilization in our study we cannot rule out the (unlikely) possibility that elevated levels of Ly6C<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> myeloid cells are due to proliferation/conversion of progenitor cells. In studies of chemokine/receptor interactions, CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12 are described as ligands for CCR2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

However, our results did not demonstrate CCL2 blockade as an effective strategy for blocking the action of CCR2, likely because of the multiple ligands that bind CCR2 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A and C</xref>). We therefore focused on the receptor CCR2 for a therapeutic target because of the difficulty of blocking multiple chemokines. These differences in the results of chemokine blockage are likely due to different tumor model systems and experimental conditions. A recent clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> showed that addition of a small molecule inhibitor of CCR2 to FOLFIRINOX in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer demonstrated anti-tumor effects.
