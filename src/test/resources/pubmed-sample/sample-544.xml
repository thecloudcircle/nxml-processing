The nuclear genes encoding key components in the photosynthetic machinery are regulated by signals originating in the plastids. These plastid signals play an essential role in the regulation of photosynthesis associated nuclear genes (<italic>PhANGs</italic>) when proplastids develop into chloroplasts. One of the plastid signals is linked to the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and accumulation of the intermediates the Mg-ProtoIX and its methyl ester Mg-ProtoIX-ME. Phytochrome-Associated Protein Phosphatase 5 (PAPP5) was isolated in a previous study as a putative Mg-ProtoIX interacting protein. In order to elucidate if there is a biological link between PAPP5 and the tetrapyrrole mediated signal we generated double mutants between the Arabidopsis <italic>papp5</italic> and the <italic>crd</italic> mutants. The <italic>crd</italic> mutant over-accumulates Mg-ProtoIX and Mg-ProtoIX-ME and the tetrapyrrole accumulation triggers retrograde signalling. The <italic>crd</italic> mutant exhibits repression of <italic>PhANG</italic> expression, altered chloroplast morphology and a pale phenotype. However, in the <italic>papp5crd</italic> double mutant, the <italic>crd</italic> phenotype is restored and <italic>papp5crd</italic> accumulated wild type levels of chlorophyll, developed proper chloroplasts and showed normal induction of <italic>PhANG</italic> expression in response to light. Tetrapyrrole feeding experiments showed that PAPP5 is required to respond correctly to accumulation of tetrapyrroles in the cell and that PAPP5 is most likely a component in the plastid signalling pathway down stream of the tetrapyrrole Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME. Inhibition of phosphatase activity phenocopied the <italic>papp5crd</italic> phenotype in the <italic>crd</italic> single mutant demonstrating that PAPP5 phosphatase activity is essential to mediate the retrograde signal and to suppress <italic>PhANG</italic> expression in the <italic>crd</italic> mutant. Thus, our results suggest that PAPP5 receives an inbalance in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis through the accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX and acts as a negative regulator of <italic>PhANG</italic> expression during chloroplast biogenesis and development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the Swedish research foundation, VR (to &#x000c5;S). from the Swedish research foundation is a Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Research Fellow supported by a grant from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

Plastids are also the location of a number of vital metabolic pathways, including primary carbon metabolism and the biosynthesis of fatty acids, amino acids and tetrapyrroles. Plastids exhibit a very clear developmental program where all plastids are derived from proplastids present in meristematic cells either direct or via the dark-grown intermediate form known as etioplasts. The etioplasts contain a characteristic lattice-like membrane structure known as the prolamellar body. The prolamellar body also contains the precursor of chlorophyll, protochlorophyllide, bound to its reducing enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Following exposure to light the prolamellar body forms the thylakoid membrane and POR is activated to convert protochlorophyllide into chlorophyllide a, which is subsequently converted into chlorophyll a and b <xref rid="pone.0060305-Pogson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Plants can detect almost all wavelengths of light using three major classes of photoreceptors: the red/far-red light absorbing phytochromes, the blue/UV-A light absorbing cryptochromes and phototropins, and the UV-B sensing UV-B receptors <xref rid="pone.0060305-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These photoreceptors perceive light signals and initiate intracellular signalling pathways involving proteolytic degradation of signalling components and large reorganization of the transcriptional program to modulate plant growth and development <xref rid="pone.0060305-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. When dark grown seedlings are exposed to light as much as one-third of the nuclear encoded genes show transcription changes <xref rid="pone.0060305-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and among the genes dramatically up-regulated in the light are genes encoding chloroplast-targeted proteins. Thus, it is clear that the initiation of chloroplast development in the light is dependent on nuclear encoded components through so called anterograde mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0060305-Leon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although the control of chloroplast development appears to be overwhelmingly under nuclear control there are several reports demonstrating that nuclear genes encoding key components in the photosynthetic machinery are regulated by signals originating in the plastids, so called retrograde mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0060305-Oelmuller1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Rapp1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>During chloroplast development a tight stoichiometric assembly of nuclear-encoded and plastid-encoded proteins together with chlorophylls and carotenoids is essential. To achieve this there must be a communication between the chloroplast and the nucleus through retrograde signalling. The first evidence of the existence of a &#x0201c;plastid signal&#x0201d; came from studies of mutants with morphologically aberrant plastids. These include mutants with defective plastid protein synthesis such as the plastid ribosome-deficient <italic>albostrians</italic> barley mutant and the <italic>Brassica napus al</italic> mutant <xref rid="pone.0060305-Zubko1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Hess1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Bradbeer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These mutants demonstrated reduced expression of nuclear-encoded plastid components suggesting that a plastid signal was emitted to repress the nuclear encoded photosynthesis genes <xref rid="pone.0060305-Bradbeer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We now know that several different plastid processes produce signals that regulate specific sets of genes or regulons and several molecular candidates for plastid signals have been described <xref rid="pone.0060305-BarajasLopez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Plastid signals are essential to the plant both during the initial developmental stages (biogenic control) and in adult stage to face changes in the environment (operational control) <xref rid="pone.0060305-Pogson2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>One of the plastids signals described to regulate the expression of photosynthesis associated nuclear genes (<italic>PhANGs</italic>) is linked to the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and accumulation of the intermediates the Mg-ProtoIX and its methyl ester Mg-ProtoIX-ME <xref rid="pone.0060305-Kropat1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Kropat2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Strand1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Kindgren1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Kindgren2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Mg-ProtoIX and Mg-ProtoIX-ME have been shown to accumulate when plants and algae are exposed to factors that give rise to oxidative stress such as exposure to low temperatures and inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport <xref rid="pone.0060305-Kindgren2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Aarti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Stenbaek1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The reason for the accumulation of these particular intermediates could be explained by the fact that the aerobic cyclase reaction was shown, both in Arabidopsis and cucumber, to be extremely sensitive to oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0060305-Aarti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Stenbaek1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, impaired flux through chlorophyll biosynthesis and the accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME is an indicator of changes in the environment and results in changes in <italic>PhANG</italic> expression. Whether accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX is itself an important part of the tetrapyrrole-mediated signal remains unclear <xref rid="pone.0060305-Mochizuki1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Moulin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In order to investigate whether Mg-ProtoIX itself is an important part of the tetrapyrrole-mediated signal, cytosolic ligands of Mg-ProtoIX were isolated from a proteomic study <xref rid="pone.0060305-Kindgren1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and the Phytochrome-Associated Protein Phosphatase 5 (PAPP5) was isolated as a one of the putative Mg-ProtoIX interacting proteins <xref rid="pone.0060305-Kindgren1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. PAPP5 is a type 5 serine/threonine protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates biologically active Pfr phytochromes and enhances the phytochrome-mediated photoresponses.

Our results further suggest that <italic>PhANG</italic> expression is controlled by a balance between inductive light signalling pathways and a repressive plastid signal triggered by impaired flux through the chlorophyll biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0060305-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0060305.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Working model for the role of PAPP5 in tetrapyrrole mediated plastid signalling.</title><p>PAPP5 pereceives an inbalance in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis through the accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIXME and acts as a negative regulator of chloroplast biogenesis and development.

The recovery of the pale phenotype is observed in <italic>papp5crd</italic> even though <italic>papp5crd</italic> showed a massive accumulation Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME in the light, similar to what was shown for <italic>crd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>papp5</italic> mutation does not rescue the cyclase activity in the <italic>crd</italic> background or restores the amount of CRD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, PAPP5 is most likely a component in the plastid signalling pathway down stream of the tetrapyrrole Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME. In support of this, the <italic>papp5</italic> single mutant demonstrated higher levels of chlorophyll following both 12 and 24 hours light exposure compared to wild type suggesting that PAPP5 acts as a negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis during the early light response. In addition, <italic>PhANG</italic> transcript levels following 12 and 24 hours light exposure were significantly higher in <italic>papp5</italic> compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060305.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, our result suggests that PAPP5 receives an inbalance in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis through the accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX and acts as a repressor during chloroplast biogenesis and development.</p><p>The deduced amino acid sequence of PAPP5 has two distinctive domains, the N-terminal domain containing the three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) responsible for the protein-protein interaction and the C-terminal domain containing the highly conserved signature motifs of a type 2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2Ac). This domain structure is a characteristic feature of members of the type 5 serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP5) subfamily <xref rid="pone.0060305-Chinkers1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. PAPP5 phosphatase activity was shown to be essential to mediate the retrograde signal and to suppress <italic>PhANG</italic> expression in the <italic>crd</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

Furthermore, a direct link between the tetrapyrrole Mg-ProtoIX and PAPP5 was demonstrated in a co-immunoprecipitation assay performed in tobacco leaves where PAPP5 was shown to interact with protein(s) that binds Mg-ProtoIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic> PAPP5 appears to be a component of a distinct protein complex that is able to bind Mg-ProtoIX. Possibly another protein partner(s) is required for PAPP5 to be able to bind the tetrapyrrole or PAPP5 is associated with another tetrapyrrole binding protein in a complex. Besides the interaction with PHYA/PHYB <xref rid="pone.0060305-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, PAPP5 has been demonstrated to interact <italic>in vivo</italic> with HSP90, PP2A and ASK1 <xref rid="pone.0060305-delaFuentevanBentem1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Lubert1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Morita1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Silverstein1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

Possibly, HSP90 and PAPP5 are components in the same complex responding to and mediating the tetrapyrrole signal from the plastids.</p><p>Feeding experiments with Mg-ProtoIX or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) further demonstrated a connection between PAPP5 and the tetrapyrroles. Feeding resulted in a significant accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX both in wild type and <italic>papp5</italic> compared to the mock samples and expression of <italic>PhANGs</italic> was repressed in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g007">Figure 7C&#x02013;D</xref>). In contrast, <italic>LHCB2.4</italic>, <italic>GLK1</italic> and <italic>GLK2</italic> expression was insensitive to Mg-ProtoIX feeding and no repression of the <italic>PhANGs</italic> could be detected in the <italic>papp5</italic> mutant.

To act as signalling molecule and to affect the activity of PAPP5 and later the expression of the <italic>PhANGs</italic>, the chlorophyll intermediate must reach the cytosol. Numerous porphyrins synthesized in the chloroplast, e.g. chlorophyll catabolites, heme and heme precursors have been found to exit the chloroplast <xref rid="pone.0060305-Ankele1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Matile1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME has also been shown to accumulate in the cytosol during stress conditions and it was proposed that the tetrapyrroles are transported across the membrane acting as putative signalling metabolites <xref rid="pone.0060305-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Ankele1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, the route(s) for transport of any tetrapyrroles from the chloroplast or the components involved in the transport are still unknown. It has also been suggested that ROS accumulation is in fact the origin of the tetrapyrrole mediated plastid signal instead of the specific accumulation of Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME <xref rid="pone.0060305-Mochizuki1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Moulin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The different ROS species activate distinct signalling pathways and the release of ROS could be an alternative explanation for the role of tetrapyrrole intermediates in retrograde signalling because many porphyrins are photoreactive and generate ROS in the presence of light <xref rid="pone.0060305-GalvezValdivieso1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Under our experimental conditions, <italic>papp5crd</italic> accumulated high levels of Mg-ProtoIX/Mg-ProtoIX-ME but in contrast to the <italic>crd</italic> single mutant where <italic>APX2</italic> expression was strongly induced, no induction of <italic>APX2</italic> expression was detected in <italic>papp5crd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, despite the tetrapyrrole accumulation, <italic>PhANG</italic> expression was restored and <italic>APX2</italic> expression was similar in <italic>papp5crd</italic> to what was observed in wild type. Possibly PAPP5 could be required to fully induce <italic>APX2</italic> expression in response to ROS or more likely, the ROS levels are correlated with the degree of chloroplast development in <italic>crd</italic> and <italic>papp5crd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>APX2</italic> expression was induced following 12 hours light exposure in wild type and the <italic>papp5</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, the expression levels were reduced after 24 hours light exposure that correlates with the time point when functional chloroplasts have developed in wild type and <italic>papp5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g005">5</xref>). <italic>APX2</italic> expression level did not drop following 24 hours illumination in the <italic>crd</italic> mutant which coincides with the undeveloped chloroplasts observed in the <italic>crd</italic> mutant at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the ROS triggered <italic>APX2</italic> induction does not appear to be correlated with the accumulated pools of tetrapyrroles but rather to the functional stage of the chloroplasts. Furthermore, specific ROS eliminators were shown to only partly reverse the tetrapyrrole-triggered repression of <italic>LHCB</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060305-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and expression of marker genes for ROS were not different in <italic>gun5</italic> mutant, impaired in the tetrapyrrole-mediated pathway, compared to wild type <xref rid="pone.0060305-Voigt1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Taken together, the tetrapyrrole mediated signal is most likely not related to an altered accumulation of ROS.</p><p>Our results suggest that expression of <italic>GLK1</italic> and <italic>GLK2</italic> is repressed by the tetrapyrrole-PAPP5 mediated plastid signal during the early light response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g009">9</xref>). Higher expression levels of <italic>GLK1</italic> and <italic>GLK2</italic> were observed in <italic>papp5</italic> compared to wild type whereas in <italic>crd</italic> the induction of <italic>GLK1/2</italic> following light exposure was significantly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g004">Figure 4B&#x02013;C</xref>). The <italic>papp5crd</italic> seedlings on the other hand displayed <italic>GLK1</italic> and <italic>GLK2</italic> expression similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g004">Figure 4B&#x02013;C</xref>). GLK1 and GLK2 are transcription factors shown to be required for chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis related gene expression during chloroplast development <xref rid="pone.0060305-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Waters2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Our results suggest that tetrapyrrole accumulation generates a PAPP5-mediated plastid signal involving a cytosolic protein that suppresses <italic>GLK1/2</italic> expression. The two <italic>GLK</italic> genes have been shown previously to respond to plastid retrograde signals and expression of <italic>GLK1/2</italic> was shown to be sensitive to the feedback signalling from the chloroplast suggesting that they may operate downstream of plastid retrograde signalling <xref rid="pone.0060305-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, the <italic>crd</italic> and <italic>glk1glk2</italic> mutants share many common features, similarly to <italic>crd</italic>, <italic>glk1glk2</italic> is pale and contain thylakoid membranes without proper grana. In addition, the <italic>glk1glk2</italic> mutant exhibits reduced transcript and protein levels for nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes, especially those associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis and light harvesting <xref rid="pone.0060305-Bang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060305-Fitter1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. This suggests that the phenotype observed in the <italic>crd</italic> mutant could partly be explained by the mis-regulation of the GLK transcription factors. The recovery of the <italic>crd</italic> phenotype in <italic>papp5crd</italic> would then be established through higher levels of chlorophyll binding proteins in the chloroplast and improved photosynthetic performance. In summary, our results demonstrate that the master regulators of <italic>PhANG</italic> expression and chloroplast development, the GLKs, are regulated by signals originating in the plastids communicating an imbalance in the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic pigments. This signal is transmitted by an unknown factor probably activated upon PAPP5-mediated dephosphorylation. This factor acts as a negative regulator of <italic>GLK</italic> expression and consequently also of chloroplast biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060305-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, chloroplast development is controlled by a delicate interplay between light and plastid signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060305.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
