It is, however, much less common in adult populations [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Multiple studies have pursued the question of whether MB is the same tumor across pediatric and adult populations. Giordana et al. suggested that there are differences in pathological features, such as nuclear polymorphism and histological signs of neuronal differentiation between pediatric and adult cases [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to differences in pathologic features, more recent studies have shown genetic re-wirings that occur in promoting adult MB such as CDK6 amplification, 10q loss, and 17q gain, which were different from MYC/MYCN oncogene amplification that are typically represented in pediatric cases [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Given the differences in histological and underlying genetic aberrations, clinical studies have been done to assess the differences in prognostic factors and survival outcomes. Multiple studies have shown that MB occurs in children more frequently but has longer survival compared to adults [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Increasing age also has a negative correlation with survival outcomes [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other demographic studies focusing on gender and race showed that gender has little association with survival outcomes in adulthood and race may be related to outcomes [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Most studies assessing prognostic factors have focused on pediatric populations. Much less is known regarding survival in adult populations, given the rarity of this age demographic. Even less is known about how tumor location and treatment modalities are related to treatment outcomes. A recent smaller scale study done in China indicated that MB tumors in the fourth ventricular floor had a higher rate of recurrence [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An older larger scale study has shown that infratentorial lesions had distinct prognostic factors from supratentorial tumors [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we will perform a comprehensive analysis on the role of various prognostic indicators, such as tumor location and treatment modality, in survival in adult MB using the SEER database.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Data source and study cohort</p><p>All data used for our analysis was extracted from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER 1973-2014) which contains nearly 30% of cancer cases in the US population. We used the International Classification of Disease for Oncology (ICD-O-3) code for medulloblastoma (9470/3) and queried for adult patients with ages &#x0003e;= 19 to obtain our working dataset. Variables that we considered in this study included, age at diagnosis, gender, race, year of diagnosis, primary site of lesion, chemotherapy treatment status, radiation sequence with surgery, surgical history, and survival. All data obtained from SEER is public and therefore received exemption for review from the Yale Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess the role of tumor location and treatment modalities on survival. We used the lifelines software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest">http://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest</ext-link>/) to perform univariate Cox proportional hazard models and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the influence of each variable on survival. A threshold of p &#x0003c; 0.05 was used to define statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Study population</p><p>In this study, we studied a total of 857 adult patients greater than the age of 19 with medulloblastoma diagnosed between the years 1973 and 2014.

Radiation, on the other hand, had a significant benefit to adult medulloblastoma patients.

Interestingly, medulloblastomas that were found outside the cerebellum had a significantly worse outcome than those found inside the cerebellum (HR 1.689, CI 1.260-1.671, p &#x0003c; 0.001). Patients who were recommended and received chemotherapy adjuvant to surgery were also amongst those who had shorter survival times (HR 1.451, CI 1.260-1.671, p &#x0003c; 0.001). Radiation therapy either before or after surgical intervention, however, does seem to lead to significant improvements in survival for patients (HR 0.581, CI 0.479-0.703, p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Table <xref rid="TAB4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="TAB4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model.</title><p>When performing a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, we identified primary tumor location, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment to be prognostic factors that have significant influence on survival duration.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Covariate</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HR (95% CI)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at diagnosis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.02 (1.01, 1.02)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001*</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.03 (0.90, 1.18)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.703</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary site</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.69 (1.32, 2.16)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001*</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chemotherapy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.45 (1.26, 1.67)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Radiation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.58 (0.48, 0.70)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001*</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Surgery</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.00 (0.71, 1.42)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.987</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many studies&#x000a0;have shown that the underlying genetic and pathological progression for MB may be different in adults. For example, a large scale genome wide association study identified more passenger mutations linked with adult MB than in children [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genetic rewirings such as CDK6 amplification, 10q loss, and 17q gain that promote MB in adults are shown to be different from the MYC oncogene amplification that is found in pediatric cases [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Histological features such as nuclear polymorphisms were much more frequent in children as compared to GFAP-positive tumor cells that were sensitive markers for adult MB [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given the inherent differences between pediatric and adult MB, it is important to investigate the predictive factors for survival in both populations.</p><p>Our analysis of adult medulloblastoma patients demonstrated multiple key findings that were not yet explored in adult populations in MB. Our study corroborates with previously published literature that increasing age is correlated with declining survival rates [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Gender, however, does not have a statistically significant association with survival in adults as compared to previous studies that point to better outcomes in female infants [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tumor location is strongly associated with survival for adult MB patients, with those having cerebellar lesions have much better outcomes than those with lesions outside the cerebellum. It has been shown that medulloblastomas appear at higher frequency in lateral cerebellar locations and have better outcomes than tumors in the supratentorial region [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We found that when further stratifying MB by location, that lesions found in the cerebellum had better outcomes than rarer MB tumors found in other infratentorial locations such as the brain stem or ventricles. In terms of treatment modality, a recent study by Weil et al. demonstrated that radiation and surgery independently predict better survival outcome for children [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The influences of these treatments were not extensively studied in adults.</p><p>We found that treatment modalities like chemotherapy and radiation had differing associations on survival outcomes for adult MB patients. Patients who received chemotherapy seemed to have more severe progression of the disease and had worse outcomes. This may be confounded by the possibility that patients who were administered chemotherapy were more likely to have progressive disease. Conversely, receiving radiation either before, during, or after surgery had positive influence on survival. Recently, Beier et al. demonstrated in NOA-07, a pilot study of radiochemotherapy as first-line treatment, that radio-polychemotherapy led to considerable toxicity [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Prospective studies are needed to characterize the optimal treatments for these patients as there is a paucity of evidence to support any standardized treatment regimen [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A few caveats must be kept in mind in addition to the inherent retrospective nature of this study using the SEER database. First, in our analysis of tumor location as a predictive marker for survival we found that there were many more cases of cerebellar MB (n = 785) than non-cerebellar lesions (n = 72). Having such imbalances our dataset may influence the power of our statistical conclusions. We faced a similar situation when comparing the efficacy of receiving radiation (n = 683) compared to no radiation (n = 168). Furthermore, our results show that patients who received chemotherapy in addition to surgery actually had shorter survival times than those who were not recommended chemotherapy. The paradoxical shorter survival for those who received chemotherapy compared to those who did not is statistically significant and may indicate the underlying aggressiveness of the tumor that would prompt physicians to give chemotherapy potentially for measures of palliation rather than treatment. Lastly, the SEER database does not account for genetic diagnostics and heterogenous nature of different radiation modalities and chemotherapies inherent in such a database.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present the most comprehensive study to date on adult medulloblastoma in studying the role of tumor locality and treatment modality in survival outcomes. This retrospective study demonstrated that MBs in non-cerebellar regions were highly correlated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, being recommended chemotherapy was linked to shorter survival times as it may indicate the greater severity of the underlying disease. Finally, receiving radiation therapy seems to be associated with longer survival times.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors
