However, toxicity, immunogenicity, and low transfection efficiency are still major barriers. How to overcome these obstacles has become a burning question in gene delivery. In the present study, a simple cationic human serum albumin (CHSA)-based gene-delivery system containing nuclear localization signals (NLSs) was constructed to conquer the limitations. CHSA/NLS/plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexes were prepared and characterized by Hoechst 33258 intercalation, gel retardation assay, morphological analysis, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, particle size, and zeta potential measurements. Results showed that CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes were able to condense and protect pDNA with high encapsulation efficiency. The complexes displayed a nutritional effect on cells at a low concentration and there was no significant cytotoxicity or immunogenicity. In addition, CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes exhibited excellent cellular uptake rates and the mechanism was mainly the clathrin or macropinocytosis-dependent endocytosis pathway. Furthermore, CHSA/NLS/pDNA significantly enhanced gene expression efficiency in vitro. More importantly, CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes showed a desired antitumor effect in vivo, exhibiting the highest inhibition rate (57.3%) and significant upregulation in p53 protein. All these results confirm that CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes have a bright future as a safe and effective delivery system for gene therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cationic human serum albumin</kwd><kwd>p53 plasmid</kwd><kwd>nuclear locating sequences</kwd><kwd>antitumor activity</kwd><kwd>gene delivery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmaceutics-11-00608"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Over the past several decades, gene therapy has become one of the most actively developing and promising branches of medicine. The application of gene-based therapy to treat or prevent a wide range of diseases has been investigated [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, success in clinical trials has been restricted due to numerous technical barriers such as low safety and high immunogenicity as well as limited transfection efficiency [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Human serum albumin (HSA), an attractive macromolecular carrier for drug delivery, has been shown to be nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, biocompatible, stable in plasma, metabolized in vivo to produce innocuous degradation products, easy to purify, and soluble in water, allowing ease of delivery by injection, and thus represents an ideal candidate for fabrication of nanoparticles for drug and gene delivery [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Human serum albumin is extremely robust to pH, temperature, and organic solvents. Due to the defined primary structure and high content of charged amino acids (e.g., lysine), human serum albumin-based nanoparticles allow for the electrostatic adsorption of negatively charged molecules such as plasmid DNA (pDNA) without requiring other compounds [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, HSA-based nanocarriers appear to be suitable agents for gene delivery because they might avoid the undesired interactions with serum that are often encountered after intravenous injection of transfection complexes; more importantly, they are known to accumulate in tumors, being preferentially taken up by tumor cells at increased levels compared to normal cells [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>However, the application of HSA-based nanocarriers in gene delivery is limited because of restricted encapsulation and protection of genetic material as well as variable transfection rates when injected intravenously [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An effective solution to this problem is to modify HSA by cationization. Compared to HSA, cationic human serum albumin may be a more effective nanocarrier for gene delivery due to its ability to electrostatically condense negatively charged nucleic acids into weakly cationic nanoparticles that penetrate the anionic cell membrane more effectively [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nanoparticles consisting of DNA, human serum albumin, and polyethyleneimine (HSA&#x02013;PEI&#x02013;DNA nanoparticles) were formed as a nonviral gene-delivery vehicle, and the data showed that serum albumin increased PEI-mediated gene transfer into airway epithelial CFT1-C2 cells and human embryonic epithelial kidney 293 cells in vitro [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, applying this strategy to different pDNA is not convenient [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, this strategy has not been used in therapeutic plasmid DNA and the uptake mechanism of the carrier is not yet clear. Moreover, there have been no results showing whether cationic HSA could increase the transfection and gene expression effect in vivo.</p><p>Gene expression of exogenous DNA depends on an essential nuclear importation process. Since free plasmid is restricted out of the nucleus, it needs to be improved in order to utilize nuclear localization sequences to facilitate the active transport of plasmid DNA into the nucleus from the cytoplasm through binding to nuclear transport proteins, thus endowing high gene expression [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T-antigen) is a widely studied and commonly investigated nuclear localization signal (NLS) for the delivery of macromolecules with a well-defined nuclear import pathway [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. </p><p>In this study, we constructed a simple and effective cationic human serum albumin (CHSA)-based gene-delivery system for CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes. HSA-based carrier has shown remarkable promise for anticancer agents because HSA is a blood-compatible protein and is not immunogenic. HSA-based carrier can prolong the circulation half-life of otherwise rapidly cleared drugs and, importantly, promote their accumulation within tumors [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In order to deliver plasmid DNA into the nuclei of cancer cells and obtain high gene expression, SV40 large T-antigen&#x02013;derived NLS was utilized during the preparation of complexes. CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes have several advantageous functions, including plasmid DNA protection, tumor cell targeting, lysosomal escape, and nuclear localization. This ingenious design may provide effective gene delivery to cancer cells and a high tumor inhibition rate. The formation of CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes as well as extracellular and intracellular trafficking for the systemic delivery of plasmid DNA to tumor cells is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f001">Figure 1</xref>. </p><p>CHSA was synthesized through the surface modification of HSA and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(SDS-PAGE), FTIR spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD).

Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo safety as well as the gene-delivery ability of the complexes were investigated. More importantly, in vivo antitumor activity of CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes containing the tumor suppressor p53 gene were investigated to determine the in vivo antitumor effect. All the results have demonstrated that CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes are a safe and effective delivery system for plasmid DNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-11-00608"><title>2.

The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The SDS-PAGE electrophoresis assay showed that the molecular weight of CHSA (about 66 KDa) was slightly higher than that of HSA and there was no distinct dimer in the solution, indicating that the high purity of protein was not influenced by the modification of HSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f002">Figure 2</xref>B, the FTIR spectra of CHSA and HSA were not significantly different in the characteristic frequency region (4000&#x02013;1300 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), indicating that there was no obvious distinction in the stretching vibration of the main amide bonds between the two proteins. However, there was a huge difference in the fingerprint area (1300&#x02013;400 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Strong absorption at 1200&#x02013;800 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 500 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was attributed to &#x003bd;<sub>C&#x02013;N</sub> bands in R&#x02013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;NH<sub>2</sub> and &#x003bd;<sub>N&#x02013;H</sub> bands in &#x02013;NH<sub>2</sub>.

The CD spectra of HSA and CHSA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f002">Figure 2</xref>C.

Results showed that the overall structure of the original protein was maintained during the modification process.

When the <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio of CHSA to pDNA was 2, complexes prepared by CHSA-3 exhibited higher encapsulation efficiency (80%) than those prepared by CHSA-2 (60%). This was probably due to the higher isoelectric point of CHSA-3 with more free amino groups, which had a stronger condensation effect on pDNA. However, when the <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio of CHSA to pDNA was above 8, the encapsulation efficiencies of CHSA-2/pDNA, CHSA-2/NLS/pDNA, CHSA-3/pDNA, and CHSA-3/NLS/pDNA were all above 90% and there was no significant difference between them, revealing that the pDNA in CHSA/pDNA/NLS complexes was fully condensed at a <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio of 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f003">Figure 3</xref>B).

As is known, one of the challenges in systemic delivery of plasmid DNA is potential degradation of the gene by endonucleases in physiological fluids and the extracellular space. The half-life of plasmid DNA has been estimated to be 10 min following intravenous injection in mice [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

As the <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio increased from 8 to 30, the particle size of CHSA/NLS/pDNA decreased and the zeta potential increased. This suggests that plasmid DNA was condensed by free amino groups on CHSA and the condensation efficiency was dependent on the weight ratio of CHSA to pDNA in the formulation. In addition, complexes prepared by CHSA-3 possessed smaller particle sizes than those prepared by CHSA-2 at the same <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio, which was probably due to the stronger compression effect of CHSA-3 on pDNA. It is worth mentioning that the particle size of complexes of around 200 nm not only have an enhanced effect on passive targeting of tumor tissues by the EPR effect, but is also beneficial for cellular uptake [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, the particle size and zeta potential of CHSA-3/NLS/pDNA and CHSA-3/pDNA were almost the same, suggesting that the addition of NLS peptide had no significant effect on the properties of the complexes.

The spherical complexes were in well-defined shapes and the complex size was around 50&#x02013;100 nm, which was relatively smaller than the result obtained by DLS.

The characteristic peaks of plasmid DNA in complexes disappeared, indicating that the double helix structure of plasmid DNA changed when it was condensed by CHSA.

As far as we know, HSA is regarded as an endogenous functional protein that plays an important role in the growth and proliferation of cells, such as nutrition, support, and material transport. Previous studies have reported that when CHSA is broken down, the amino acids will provide nutrition to peripheral cells and tissues [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As the concentration of CHSA-3 increased, the viability of HepG2 and A549 cells first increased and subsequently decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B), which suggests that CHSA could have a nutritional effect on cells at a low concentration. However, as the concentration reached the milligram level, there was significant cytotoxicity after long-time action. This might be due to the positive charges on the surface of CHSA, which were still cytotoxic to the cells at a large concentration. Nevertheless, the concentration of CHSA was far from cytotoxic under experimental conditions, so CHSA could be considered to be a safe and low-toxicity carrier. In order to explore the influence of the <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio on cytotoxicity, HepG2 and A549 cells were treated with CHSA-2/NLS/pDNA and CHSA-3/NLS/pDNA complexes at various <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratios for 48 h.

Cellular Uptake and Its Mechanisms</title><p>To study the cellular uptake of CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes, HepG2 and A549 cells were incubated with FITC-labeled complexes. The mean fluorescence intensity of complexes were evaluated by flow cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B, CHSA-3/NLS/pDNA showed stronger cellular uptake than CHSA-2/NLS/pDNA in both cells at a <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio of 15 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The results suggest that CHSA-3, which has more positive surface charges, could play a greater role in improving cellular uptake. It is also noteworthy that there was no significant difference between CHSA-2/pDNA and CHSA-2/NLS/pDNA (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), so we were able to conclude that the introduction of NLS peptide had no significant effect on cellular uptake. In addition, the mean fluorescence intensity of CHSA-3/NLS/pDNA complexes was enhanced in both cells as the <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio was gradually increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). With a <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio less than 2, no significance was observed between CHSA-3/NLS/pDNA complexes and the control group, but when the <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> ratio was up to 4, cellular uptake increased significantly. Most probably, CHSA was internalized into the cells through the positively charged amino groups combined with the negatively charged proteins on the cell surface and the increment slowed down while the combination tended to be saturated. Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f005">Figure 5</xref>D, the mean fluorescence intensity was gradually enhanced over time.</p><p>Understanding the uptake mechanism of nonviral gene delivery systems is important in the development of more efficient carriers. An endocytosis inhibition assay was carried out in order to explore the endocytosis pathway for CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f005">Figure 5</xref>E, the cellular uptake efficiency of complexes was significantly decreased after treatment with low temperature (down to 18% in A549 cells, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and NaN<sub>3</sub> (down to 54% in HepG2 cells, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). It is widely known that low temperature can inhibit cell metabolism, thereby reducing the energy produced in cells. Meanwhile, NaN<sub>3</sub> combined with 2-deoxyglucose can interfere with the glycolysis and oxidative metabolism pathway, thereby blocking the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in cells [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The results indicate that the internalization of complexes was clearly energy-dependent. As is known, high concentrations of sucrose can inhibit cell endocytosis in a hypertonic environment. After incubation with sucrose, the cellular uptake rate in both cells decreased significantly (down to 34.6% in HepG2 cells, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, and 20.3% in A549 cells, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), indicating that the complexes entered these two cells through the endocytosis pathway. In addition, M-&#x003b2;-CD can extract cholesterol from the cell membrane and inhibit caveolin-mediated endocytosis [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Compared to the untreated group, no significant change was found after treatment with M-&#x003b2;-CD, suggesting that the caveolin-mediated endocytosis pathway was not the main route into cells. At the same time, the cellular uptake rate was significantly reduced after treatment with chlorpromazine (down to 45% on average, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), showing clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Moreover, after amiloride treatment, no obvious difference (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) was found in HepG2 cells, while there was a distinct decrease in A549 cells (down to 34.6%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The results indicated that amiloride exerted an effect on the uptake of complexes in A549 cells. The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter on the surface of the cell membrane is an indispensable part of the macropinocytosis pathway. Amiloride can block the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter and eventually block the macropinocytosis pathway [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the macropinocytosis pathway is one way that complexes can enter A549 cells. This was probably because there were many positive amino groups on the surface of CHSA that could interact with negatively charged proteins on the cell surface and stimulate the cell to upregulate micropinocytosis. Cellular uptake is a complicated process, as it involves many molecules, and sometimes the same kind of complex can be internalized through different uptake pathways in different cell types, or sometimes the same type of cell can take up different kinds of complexes through different mechanisms [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Some proteins, such as small GTPase and Ras-related to the brain (Rab), are essential for the macropinocytosis process [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-11-00608" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The results here may be due to the different levels of proteins in the macropinocytosis process between A549 and HepG2 cells. In general, the aforementioned results have illustrated that the internalization of CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes in HepG2 cells is mainly by the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway. By contrast, complexes entered A549 cells by the macropinocytosis- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathways.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-pharmaceutics-11-00608"><title>3.6.

At the same time, the body weight of CHSA-3/NLS/p53 and Lipofectamine-treated mice increased, while mice treated with saline and free plasmid lost weight after the eighth day of administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). As far as we know, changes in body weight are regarded as an indication of safety, so the results more likely indicated the outstanding compatibility of CHSA-3/NLS/p53. Similar results were observed in the inhibition rate (IR%), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f007">Figure 7</xref>E. Compared with saline, free plasmid displayed relatively low antitumor activity (IR% = 23.1%), while CHSA-3/NLS/p53 had the highest inhibition rate (57.3%). Most probably, naked pDNA would be readily degraded in the blood circulation and consequently have an indistinct effect on tumors. This contrast also shows that CHSA-3/NLS/DNA complexes could escape capture by the RES system during blood circulation to some extent and arrive at the tumor site to suppress tumor growth.</p><p>Tumor suppressor protein p53 in tumor tissue of S180 xenografted mice was determined by western blotting, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00608-f007">Figure 7</xref>D,F. There was significant upregulation of the p53 protein after treatment with CHSA-3/NLS/p53 complexes, implying that the antitumor activity was more likely due to the high expression level of the p53 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-pharmaceutics-11-00608"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, a simple and effective CHSA-based gene delivery system was successfully constructed and evaluated. CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes showed low immunogenicity and high pDNA encapsulation efficiency, while they were able to condense and protect pDNA against degradation by nuclease in blood circulation and clearance by the RES system in vivo. In addition, complexes displayed a nutritional effect on cells at low concentration and no significant cytotoxicity. Furthermore, CHSA/NLS/pDNA complexes exhibited admirable cellular uptake and gene expression efficiency, with the help of a nuclear localization signal. More importantly, CHSA/NLS/p53 displayed desired in vivo antitumor ability. All these results have enhanced our confidence that CHSA/NLS/DNA could be a new strategy for gene therapy.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-pharmaceutics-11-00608"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/11/11/608/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/11/11/608/s1</uri>, Figure S1.
