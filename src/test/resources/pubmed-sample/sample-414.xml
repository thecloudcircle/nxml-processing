The results showed that mRNA structural stability of the signal sequences was not correlated with the protein production and secretion levels, and FibHsp was more tolerable to codon changes than GP64sp. Codon bias analyses revealed that codons for GP64sp were well de-optimized and contained more non-optimal codons than FibHsp. Synonymous mutations in GP64sp sufficiently increased its average codon usage frequency and resulted in dramatic reduction of the activity and secretion of luciferase. Protein degradation inhibition assay with MG-132 showed that higher codon usage frequency in the signal sequence increased the production as well as the degradation of luciferase protein, indicating that the synonymous codon substitutions in the signal sequence caused misfolding of luciferase instead of slowing down the protein production. Meanwhile, we found that introduction of more non-optimal codons into FibHsp could increase the production and secretion levels of luciferase, which suggested a new strategy to improve the production of secretory proteins in insect cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>HC is supported by the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-09-0652) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (QN2011065).

All amino acids, except Met and Trp, are encoded by two to six codons. Increasing evidences have clearly shown that synonymous codons are not used equally in many species. This phenomenon is termed codon usage bias [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For instance, highly expressed genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisia</italic>e have been found to selectively use optimal codons with high usage frequency [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Considering that the genomic codon frequency is usually correlated with the abundance of the cognate tRNAs, the abundant tRNAs for their optimal codons can transport enough amino acids for the rapid decoding of these highly expressed genes by ribosomes. Therefore, a plausible explanation for the correlation of the usage of optimal codons with the production level of individual genes is that highly expressed genes are translated at higher speed than other genes [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Experiments have demonstrated that substitution of synonymous codons can affect protein translation level [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as well as other co-translational or post-translational processes including protein folding [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], aggregation [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and translocation [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Signal peptide, the short peptide which directs the newly synthesized protein to the secretory pathway in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, majorly locates at the N terminus of secretory proteins. Although the sequences of signal peptides vary greatly, they all contain basic amino acids in the N-terminal region, followed by a middle hydrophobic core region and a C-terminal region containing polar amino acids. Different signal sequences can be interchanged between different proteins or even between proteins from different organisms. It is also a feasible way to improve the expression and secretion of some proteins by changing the type of the amino acids in their signal peptides [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Notably, genome-wide analyses have revealed high incidences of non-optimal codons at the N-terminal region of secretory protein genes in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Introducing synonymous codons with different usage frequency into signal peptides can provide new insights into the expression and secretion of secretory proteins. Using this strategy, it has been shown that non-optimal codons in the signal sequence of maltose binding protein (MBP) and &#x003b2;-lactamase are of great importance for the correct folding and export of the proteins [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Codon substitutions are always coupled with the change of mRNA secondary structure, and the latter also acts as an important regulatory factor on gene expression. It is always hard to determine whether the codon usage or the mRNA structure is the determinant of protein expression and translocation. Generally, mRNA folding with higher free energy tends to have less secondary structure; conversely, that holding lower folding energy tends to form more stable secondary structure. Additional energy is required to unfold stable secondary structure, and this will obviously hinder ribosome from translation initiation or moving along the mRNA during protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The stability of mRNA secondary structure adds complexity to protein expression regulation [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recently, a stable mRNA secondary structure in the region of 30&#x02013;80 nt downstream of the translation start codon was identified by computational analyses. The structural stability in this region was thought to be correlated with the translocation of secreted proteins [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This provides an interesting hypothesis that secondary structure at the N-terminus of the mRNAs for secretory proteins promotes ribosomal pause at early stage of elongation, benefitting the protein localization [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we investigated whether mRNA secondary structure stability or codon usage frequency in signal peptides affected protein expression and secretion using baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Two signal peptides, GP64sp from GP64 of <italic>Autographa californica</italic> multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and FibHsp from the heavy chain of fibroin of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, were recoded with synonymous codons and fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. The expression and secretion of luciferase directed by these signal peptides were quantified and compared. We found that the correct folding and stability of the passenger protein was correlated with the non-optimal codon usage instead of the mRNA secondary structure stability in the signal sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Time course for the expression and secretion of luciferase</title><p>To express firefly luciferase using baculovirus/insect cell expression system, the reporter&#x02019;s gene was cloned into pBac-5, a vector containing modified gp64 tandem early and late promoters which can initiate protein expression immediately after infection and also drive continued protein expression in the late phase of infection. In a previous study, we have reported that the expression of fluorescent proteins under the control of these tandem promoters can be detected as early as 8 hours post-infection (hpi) [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Here, the expression and secretion levels of luciferase fused with FibHsp, a signal peptide of Fibroin heavy chain from <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, were examined at 12, 36 and 60 hpi (<xref rid="pone.0145887.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The results showed that the enzyme activity of luciferase was detectable, but at low levels, in both <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells and the cell culture media at 12 hpi, and the protein levels increased dramatically at 36 hpi. Even though the protein expression levels increased about 30 fold from 12 hpi to 60 hpi, the average secretion ratios remained between 35% and 40%. Similar results were obtained for luciferase fused with signal peptide GP64sp (data not shown). Therefore, in all further studies in this report, the reporter protein was examined at the time point of 36 hpi, when the protein expression reached a reasonable high level and the virus-infected cells were still in good condition.</p><fig id="pone.0145887.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145887.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Time course for the expression and secretion of luciferase fused with FibHsp.</title><p>A.

In a previous report, we found a high structural stability region (HSR) in the 30&#x02013;80 nt region of mRNAs encoding secretory proteins by bioinformatics [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, a significant correlation between structural stability and protein localization was revealed based on genome analysis. In order to study whether the high stability of this region plays a role in protein expression and secretion, here, we introduced synonymous substitutions in <italic>GP64sp</italic> to acquire mutants with altered mRNA stability by computer. For each mutant, the minimal free energy (mfe), an indicator widely used in representing the secondary structure stability of mRNA, was calculated. Among all the possible mutants, <italic>5101</italic> and <italic>5102</italic> used in this study had the lowest mfe, corresponding to the reduced structural stability. <italic>5201</italic> had a middle mfe close to the wild type <italic>GP64sp</italic>, and <italic>5211</italic> had the highest mfe. The predicted mRNA secondary structure and mfe for <italic>GP64sp</italic> and its four mutants used in this study were shown in <xref rid="pone.0145887.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>. The mutated signal sequences and wild type <italic>GP64sp</italic> were then fused to the upstream of <italic>luciferase</italic> gene to direct the secretion of luciferase. The luciferase activity of their secreted and non-secreted protein products was then examined in parallel with the enzyme expressed without signal peptide. As expected, luciferase without signal peptide (FNCOI in <xref rid="pone.0145887.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) was not secreted but produced in a much higher level than those with signal peptide, probably because the secretion process caused translation elongation arrest and slowed down the protein synthesis. Interestingly, in all of the four mutants, we found that both the enzyme activity and secretion ratio of the reporter decreased to very low levels, regardless of the mRNA structural stability (<xref rid="pone.0145887.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Our results suggested that the stability of mRNA secondary structure in <italic>GP64sp</italic> had little effects on the expression and secretion of its passenger protein.

The results obtained from both GP64sp and FibHsp groups suggested that non-optimal codons in the signal sequences could play an important role in the correct folding and export of the reporter protein.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Luciferase directed by signal sequences with higher codon usage frequencies is more sensitive to the proteasome-dependent degradation</title><p>In <xref rid="pone.0145887.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, luciferase activity was observed dramatically declined in the GP64sp mutants, suggesting that luciferase could be misfolded when it was directed by the mutated signal sequences containing more high-frequency codons. During protein synthesis, proteins that are unfolded or misfolded in the endoplasmic reticulum tend to be tagged with ubiquitin and then degraded in proteasome [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To investigate whether protein misfolding contributed to the decrease of luciferase activity directed by the <italic>GP64sp</italic> mutants, MG-132, a cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor widely used for reducing the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], was used in this study to inhibit misfolded luciferase from being degraded by proteasome. Several doses of MG-132 (5, 10, 20 and 40 &#x003bc;M) were assessed for the cytotoxicity of the drug.

By densitometric scanning of the bands from three independent experiments, the relative luciferase expression levels of the mutants were calculated to the protein level with the wild type signal peptide and shown in the figure. Given that Western blot is only a semi-quantitative method, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was further carried out for more accurate measurement of the luciferase expression with or without MG-132 treatment (<xref rid="pone.0145887.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The ELISA data were consistent with the Western blot results that the relative expression levels of luciferase fused with mutated GP64 signal peptide (5101, 5102, 5201 and 5211), significantly increased at the presence of MG-132. In the FibHsp group, Fib76 and Fib389, the two mutants containing more non-optimal codons and expressed at higher levels in the absence of MG-132, did not produce more proteins than FibHsp at the presence of MG-132. These results confirmed our postulation that more optimal codons in signal sequences could promote translation speed but result in more folding deficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using computational methods, we have found that mRNAs in the 30&#x02013;80 nucleotide intervals for secretory proteins have significantly higher stability than other regions of secretory proteins and the region for non-secretory proteins [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, by introducing synonymous codons into GP64sp and FibHsp, we investigated the influence of mRNA secondary structure stability of signal sequences on protein expression and secretion using baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The results show that mfe of HSR in GP64sp and FibHsp have no correlation with the protein expression and secretion, suggesting that the structural stability of the signal sequences is not the determinant for the production and translocation of secretory proteins although this structural region has undergone selection pressure to maintain high stability.</p><p>
<italic>GP64sp</italic>, a signal sequence from <italic>GP64</italic> of baculovirus AcMNPV, has been widely used for the expression of secretory proteins in baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Here we find that this signal sequence has been well de-optimized and synonymous substitutions in this region could drastically affect the enzyme activity and secretion of luciferase as its passenger protein. By western blots, ELISA and protein degradation inhibition assay with MG-132, we show that introducing optimal codons in the signal sequence can increase the production as well as the degradation of luciferase protein. In prokaryotic cells, it has been shown that non-optimal codons in signal peptides play an important role in the correct folding of secretory MBP and &#x003b2;-lactamase [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A reasonable explanation for these observations is that the non-optimal codons in the signal sequences may slowdown the translation elongation in this region and this could be important for the correctly folding and secretion of proteins.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that optimized codons can contribute to the fast movement of ribosome, but it can also impair the activity of proteins or result in the proteolysis as the change of codon usage can affect the co-translational folding of protein [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Data from synonymous substitution of signal sequences also suggest that high frequency usage of non-optimal codons in signal sequences probably plays a similar role in the regulation of translation in bacterial cells [<xref rid="pone.0145887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145887.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The mechanism of protein translocation is still far from being completely understood. We speculate that non-optimal codons in signal sequences are required for the correct folding and binding of the nascent signal peptide to signal recognition particle. Misfolding of signal peptide caused by the fast decoding of the substituted higher frequency codons may interrupt the interaction of signal peptide with the signal recognition particle, and therefore block the on-going secretion and result in a disorder of the passenger protein translation. Further work is needed to verify this speculation.</p><p>Another interesting discovery from this study is that the codons for FibHsp, the signal peptide for the most abundant secretory protein in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, are not de-optimized as well as GP64sp and the sequence is more tolerable with synonymous codon substitutions. Introduction of non-optimal codons in Fib76 and Fib389 resulted in higher production and secretion levels of reporter protein. FibHsp is a potent signal peptide for the production of secreted proteins using baculovirus/insect cell expression platform. It is worthy to investigate whether introducing more non-optimal codons into FibHsp will further improve the production and secretion of passenger proteins.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study directly showing that synonymous codon substitutions of signal peptide have influence on passenger protein expression and secretion in eukaryotic cells. Further studies on codon bias in signal peptides may give us new insights into the protein co-translational process, including protein folding and translocation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Secondary structure prediction</title><p>The prediction of mRNA secondary structure and calculation of minimum free energy (mfe) were achieved online using the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi</ext-link>).
