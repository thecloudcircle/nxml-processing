Identification of polyphenols, amino acids and fatty acids was carried out in both types of chocolate analysed, and results confirmed their richness in polyphenols, amino acid derivatives and fatty acids (FAs) either saturated (stearic, myristic, palmitic, ecosanoic) or unsaturated (oleic and linolenic). For agreeability, Choco-A scored higher than Choco-I for smell, texture, and taste and they did not show significant differences in the gastrointestinal motility.

Introduction</title><p>In recent decades, nutrition research has focused on the investigation of bioactive dietary compounds widely found in many plant-based foods and beverages, with the aim of elucidating their beneficial properties to human health. Cocoa (<italic>Theobroma cacao</italic> L.) and chocolate products appear to be one of the most promising foods for their high polyphenol and alkaloid contents [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cocoa and chocolate have a pleasant taste and beneficial effects have been described on health, mediated by lipid and antioxidant components. Dark chocolate consists of about 43% lipid, mainly cocoa butter (as 33% oleic acid, 25% palmitic acid and 33% stearic acid) [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Chocolate is a renowned source of flavanols such as epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins that may offer cardiometabolic protection through several mechanisms, including antihypertensive, antiplatelet, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A meta-analysis study put in correlation chocolate intake and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and diabetes, concluding that consuming chocolate in moderation (&#x02264;6 servings/week) can be optimal for preventing these disorders. Other bioactives in chocolate, in particular methylxanthines, enhance the effects of cocoa flavanols on cardiovascular function [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, flavanols in chocolate have been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, by promoting the survival and function of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells and by improving the insulin signaling pathway in hepatic cells [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Dark chocolate ingestion and cocoa polyphenol content was reported to modulate intestinal microbiota, thus leading to the growth of bacteria that triggered a tolerogenic anti-inflammatory pathway in the host. In a human trial conducted on healthy volunteers, consumption of a high-cocoa flavanol beverage for four weeks proved to significantly increase the growth of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp., bacteria capable of maintaining an anti-inflammatory status in the bowel, in comparison to a low cocoa flavanol drink [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study suggests that cocoa polyphenols may behave as prebiotics and trigger a tolerogenic pathway in the gut. In addition, the consumption of dark chocolate can influence basal human metabolism, as reported by Francois-Pierre J. Martin et al. They studied the reduction of cortisol and catecholamine production as a result of chocolate consumption on a group of 30 human subjects, with low and high anxiety traits [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Based on these considerations, we focused on dark chocolate, deemed a nutraceutical food. For the current study two representative types of dark chocolate (70% of cocoa), artisanal and industrial, were chosen in order to investigate eventual differences and if they might exert any influence on the clinical tests. In the present paper, we chemically characterized both types of chocolate and tested the organoleptic perceptions in a restricted group of consumers identified. Because of the distinctive gut response to food components [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we also studied the gastrointestinal motility patterns (i.e., stomach and gallbladder by ultrasonography, and orocecal transit by hydrogen breath test) in response to the consumption of both types of dark chocolate, as compared to a standard test meal.</p><p>In this pilot study, we enrolled 50 subjects for the sensory evaluation of both types of chocolate, in addition to a subgroup of 16 individuals assessed for the motility studies of the gastrointestinal tract. The well-balanced group of subjects consisted of healthy volunteers who provided data to build up a reference database about perception and motility parameters, thus avoiding any interference due to other factors, such as old age, overweight, obesity, other diseases, and symptoms.</p><p>The choice of using the standard test meal in the present work was based on our previous extensive experience dealing with groups of healthy subjects and different types of patients, as already reported [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In this comprehensive study, we therefore combined chemical analyses, organoleptic evaluation, and gastrointestinal motility studies of two types of dark chocolate, while providing novel and physiologically relevant updates.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-12-00939"><title>2. Materials and Methods </title><p>The study design consisted of chemical characterization of two types of chocolate, Choco-A, artisanal and Choco-I, industrial. In addition, organoleptic evaluation of both chocolates was performed by 50 healthy subjects enrolled in the study.

Chocolate (1 g) was washed with hexane (ratio 1:5 w/v) to remove the lipidic phase and with ethanol 80% v/v in a ratio 1:10 w/v. After an intense agitation with vortex at 10,976 g/min for 10 min at room temperature, a sonication (C.E.I.A S.p.A., CP 104, Viciomaggio, Italy) for 15 min was performed, followed by centrifugation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Osterodeam Harz, Germany) at 15,805 g/min for 10 min. Three washes were performed for each sample.

(2019) [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 20 &#x003bc;L of chocolate extract was added to 980 &#x003bc;L of ddH<sub>2</sub>O and 100 &#x000b5;L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. After 3 min, 800 &#x000b5;L of 7.5% Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution was added, following incubation at room temperature for 60 min. The absorbance was read at 720 nm using a Cary 60 spectrophotometer Agilent (Cernusco, Milan Italy). The TPC was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of chocolate. The antioxidant activity determination was carried out by DPPH and ABTS assays reported in Difonzo et al. [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The DPPH assay was performed by preparing a solution of DPPH 0.08 mM in ethanol. In cuvettes for spectrophotometry, 50 &#x000b5;L of each sample were added to 950 &#x000b5;L of DPPH solution. After 30 min in the dark, the decrease of absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a Cary 60 spectrophotometer Agilent (Cernusco, Milan, Italy). The ABTS radical was generated by chemical reaction with potassium persulfate (K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>). For this purpose, 25 mL of ABTS (7 mM in H<sub>2</sub>O) was spiked with 440 &#x003bc;L of K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (140 mM) and kept in the dark at room temperature for 12&#x02013;16 h. The working solution was prepared by diluting with H<sub>2</sub>O to obtain a final absorbance at 734 nm equal to 0.80 &#x000b1; 0.02 [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Sample Preparation</title><p>As first step LC-MS/MS analysis was accomplished on chocolate extracts with the aim to identify the main polyphenols characterizing both types of chocolate (artisanal and industrial). The extraction procedure was performed according to Ortega et al. [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, 1 g of minced chocolate was defatted with 5 mL of hexane to get the final ratio of 1:5 v/v. Hexane was then removed and the defatted chocolate powder was combined with the solvent extraction (acetone/MilliQ water/acetic acid, 70/29.5/0.5, v/v/v) at the final ratio of 1:10. After a vigorous vortexing for 10 min (10,976 g min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) at room temperature, the extract was sonicated in ultrasound bath (C.E.I.A S.p.A., CP 104, Viciomaggio, Italy) at room temperature for 15 min and finally centrifuged (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Osterodeam Harz, Germany) at 15,805 g/min for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and stored in a clean vial. The remaining pellet was then submitted to additional two extraction cycles (making a total of three extraction cycles). The supernatants obtained from each extraction step were then pooled together and filtered on filter papers (Cordenons, PN, Italy). The organic solvent was removed by rotary evaporation (Buchi, Labortechnick AG, Switzerland) under partial vacuum. Finally, the water extract was freeze-dried (Hetossic freeze drier A.

Thus, results appeared to be very similar between both types of chocolate whereas were highly different when compared with the Nutridrink test meal.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec6-nutrients-12-00939"><title>6. Discussion</title><p>In this comprehensive study, we combined chemical analyses, organoleptic evaluation, and gastrointestinal motility studies of two types of dark chocolates, while providing novel and physiologically relevant updates.</p><p>According to the literature [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we confirm the high levels of polyphenol contained in both chocolates analysed, with particular regard to theobromine, procyanidin and epicatechin. Other compounds detected by mass spectrometry untargeted analysis are catechins, quercetin and chlorogenic acid considered phenols endowed with antioxidant properties. The wealth of polyphenol and the associated beneficial effects in relation to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, place chocolate among the nutraceuticals, encouraging its consumption in the diet of healthy and dismetabolic individuals [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Regarding other chemical analysis, the category encompassing amino acids and their derivatives, accounts for the total compounds detected by MS/MS analysis. The levels of amino acids detected are in correlation with the protocol used for chocolate production. It has been reported that cacao beans fermented for 120 h (control (TI)) showed higher amino acid content, specifically for aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, isoleucine, proline and valine (hydrophobic). In valine, we also detected high levels of aspartic acid and glutamic acid as well as phenilalanine followed by other amino acids at a lower level [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Phenylalanine is in particular included among the essential amino acids, namely those molecules the body is not able to produce on its own. These amino acids are crucial for the production of tyrosine, but also for the production of epinephrine/norepinephrine and dopamine involved in the body&#x02019;s normal functioning, including mood and stress responses.</p><p>As far as the lipid profile is concerning the class of FA, in particular, plays an important role in the beneficial effects exerted on different organs, especially with regard to the essential FA represented by the polyunsaturated FA. Cocoa butter typically contains both monounsaturated and saturated FA. Palmitic acid and stearic acid (C<italic><sub>16:0</sub></italic>, C<italic><sub>18:0</sub></italic>) are the most abundant saturated FA while oleic acid and linoleic acid (C<italic><sub>18:1</sub></italic> and C<italic><sub>18:2</sub></italic>), are the most representative of the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FA [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. According to our results the FA identified in the chocolate analysed are: stearic acid representing the most abundant (~28%), followed by the polyunsaturated FA linoleic acid also called omega-3 (~20%), myristic acid (19%) and oleic acid (16%). Lower percentages of lauric acid, palmitoleic acid, pinolenic acid, arachidic acid and pentadecanoic acid were also calculated in the extracts accounting respectively for 6%, 3%, 3%, 2% and 1%. In particular the high content of stearic acid is important from a clinical perspective since it has been reported to be anti-atherogenic contributing to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Alpha-linolenic acid, preponderant in chocolate, is popular for preventing and treating diseases of the heart and blood vessels enhancing the beneficial effect exerted by this food against heart attack and high blood pressure, lowering cholesterol in the blood [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the health promoting properties of flavonols and unsaturated fatty acids identified, dark chocolate 70% contains an average of 8 g of fiber per 100 g corresponding to 32% of the fiber recommended daily allowance for a mature adult. Fibers play a pivotal role in promoting health, especially because they are reported to improve the low density lipoprotein (LDL): high density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, and also reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In particular cocoa husks are a particular good source of dietary fiber, mostly insoluble fiber [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Such a product might be of interest for the food industry, with potential use as an ingredient in fiber-rich functional foods. Besides the benefits derived from its high fiber content, cocoa fibers would provide protection against oxidative damage by means of its content in phenolic compounds (epicatechin) which are absorbed, maintaining the antioxidant properties in vivo.</p><sec id="sec6dot1-nutrients-12-00939"><title>6.1. Perception Study</title><p>Results confirm that in the fasting state volunteers can appreciate several differences between the two dark chocolates. Most evident differences concerned significantly increased scores for domains like &#x0201c;snap&#x0201d;, smell, texture and bitter taste, in Choco-A compared with Choco-I. Differences in both domains are likely to be dependent on different texture composition of artisanal chocolate vs. industrial chocolate. In principle, such differences might partly influence the early kinetic response of the gastrointestinal tract due, for example, to the neural cephalic phase anticipating the neuro-hormonal gallbladder contraction in response to fat. Upon meal ingestion and arrival in the gastro-duodenal segment, in fact, both neural (vagal), and hormonal (cholecystokinin, CCK) stimuli will govern the subsequent gastro-cholecysto-intestinal motility [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot2-nutrients-12-00939"><title>6.2. Motility Study</title><p>We further explored the effects of chocolates on gastrointestinal motility. This aspect has never been properly assessed before, and in this study it was performed in correlation with a comprehensive evaluation of sensory properties. The two chocolates were fully comparable in terms of lipids, protein and carbohydrates content, whereas the test meal had the same amount of fat but a greater amount of proteins and carbohydrates than both chocolates. The final volume of the lactulose containing the three meals, however, was fully comparable to achieve similar initial gastric response. </p><p>In the gallbladder, both chocolates induced comparable emptying responses by achieving more than 50% gallbladder emptying by 40 min. This prokinetic response provided adequate flushing of gallbladder bile and might be also useful to prevent gallbladder stasis in a number of conditions (i.e., obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, etc.) [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], predisposing to super saturation of gallbladder bile, a condition at risk of cholesterol accumulation and gallstone growth [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In the stomach, both chocolates induced comparable emptying profiles with maximal antral area comparable to that obtained with Nutridrink (i.e., ~12 cm<sup>2</sup>). This response likely depends on the effect of three isovolumetric meals. Gastric emptying speed, however, was faster than gallbladder emptying time. By 50% of refilling time (79 min), both chocolates produced a significant increase of breath hydrogen. Approximately 10 min after 50% refilling time, the orocecal transit time was observed. Of note, both chocolate meals produced similar transit time. By contrast, the test meal was faster in inducing gastric emptying and gallbladder emptying, but slower with gallbladder refilling and orocecal transit time. These findings might easily be explained by different characteristics of the meals and by the more intense test meal-depending gallbladder contraction, possibly modulating both refilling and subsequent intestinal transit [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>We must point out that none of the subjects reported symptoms related to dyspepsia, i.e., bloating, nausea and epigastric pain. We confirm that the mean score of dyspepsia is extremely low in healthy subjects, as shown in previous studies [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B49-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-nutrients-12-00939" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The ingestion of the test meals was not associated with dyspeptic symptoms (especially fullness) throughout the observation time. Likely, the moderate volume (215 mL) and the isosmotic/fat composition of the test meals (12 g) fat, was not sufficient to trigger upper gastrointestinal symptoms in these groups of subjects.</p><p>This study provides a great deal of relevant information when dealing with nutrients and type of foods, and both the composition of food and the pathophysiological behavior of the gastrointestinal motility with respect to organoleptic features are important. Here, we show that the fat content and final volume of liquid meals were comparable, but profound differences exist in terms of gastric, gallbladder and intestinal transit. </p><p>In conclusion, chocolate as a dark food, also introduced as a gratifying food, in its artisanal form has characteristics that suggest a favorable use compared to industrial chocolate. The artisanal chocolate has good kinetic properties, comparable to other chocolates (industrial chocolate), but has better organoleptic characteristics. Therefore, the ingestion of a small amount of chocolate equivalent to a discreet contraction of the gallbladder is able to stimulate the gallbladder, induce a contraction of the stomach and also speed up the transit time that proved to be faster than a standard meal with a good fermentation curve.</p><p>Studies are in progress to evaluate other organoleptic aspects and kinetic aspects, for example on gastrointestinal permeability, to assess the impact of dark chocolate on lipid metabolism. Studies are also in progress to assess chronic effect following the intake of chocolate. </p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are thankful to Domenico Genchi (CNR-ISPA) for his help in the bioinformatic analysis and to Paola De Benedictis and Rosa De Venuto (UNIBA) for skillful technical assistance.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-nutrients-12-00939"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/939/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/939/s1</uri>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="nutrients-12-00939-s001"><media xlink:href="nutrients-12-00939-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, M.D.A., L.M., M.T.M. and P.P.; methodology M.D.A., L.M. and P.P.; formal analysis, G.R.C., G.D.
