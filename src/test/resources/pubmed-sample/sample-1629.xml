Cotransfection of four monocistronic expression vectors for these subunits and nucleoprotein with an expression vector for viral RNA reconstitutes functional viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). However, the specific activity of reconstituted RdRp is usually very low since the expression level and the ratio of the three subunits by transfection are uncontrollable at single-cell levels. For efficient reconstitution of RdRp and vRNP, their levels need to be at least comparable. We constructed polycistronic expression vectors in which the coding sequences of the three subunits were joined with the 2A-like self-processing sequence of <italic>Thosea asigna</italic> virus (TaV2A) in various orders. The level of PB1 protein, even when it was placed at the most downstream, was comparable with that expressed from the monocistronic PB1 vector. In contrast, the levels of PB2 and PA were very low, the latter of which was most likely due to proteasomal degradation caused by the TaV2A-derived sequences attached to the amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal ends in this expression system. Interestingly, two of the constructs, in which the PB1 coding sequence was placed at the most upstream, showed much higher reporter activity in a luciferase-based mini-genome assay than that observed by cotransfection of the monocistronic vectors. When the coding sequence of selective antibiotic marker was further placed at the most downstream of the PB1-PA-PB2 open reading frame, stable cells expressing RdRp were easily established, indicating that acquisition of antibiotic resistance assured the expression of upstream RdRp. The addition of an affinity tag to the carboxyl-terminal end of PB2 allowed us to isolate reconstituted vRNP. Taken together, the polycistronic expression system for influenza virus RdRp may be available for functional and structural studies on vRNP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>self-processing sequence</kwd><kwd>polycistronic expression</kwd><kwd>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>ribonucleoprotein complex</kwd><kwd>proteasomal degradation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The genome of influenza A virus consists of eight-segmented negative sense, single-strand RNAs (vRNAs) (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Portela and Digard, 2002</xref>). Both termini of each vRNA form a partially double-stranded structure so-called &#x0201c;panhandle&#x0201d; region, which functions as the transcription promoter and the genome replication origin (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Desselberger et al., 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 1987</xref>). Each vRNA segment exists as a ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) in which viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) binds the panhandle region, and nucleoproteins (NP) regularly bind the single strand region. This vRNP structure is required for full-length RNA synthesis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Beaton and Krug, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro and Krug, 1988</xref>), the localization of progeny vRNP on Rab11-positive recycling endosome (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Eisfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Momose et al., 2011</xref>), high-order assembly of vRNPs, leading to selective packaging of eight progeny vRNP segments into a virion (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Influenza A virus RdRp is a heterotrimeric complex of PB2, PB1, and PA subunits and is a multifunctional enzyme (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fodor, 2013</xref>) that catalyzes both primer-dependent viral mRNA transcription (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Plotch et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Poon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Guilligay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al., 2009</xref>) and primer-independent genome RNA replication (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Young and Content, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hay et al., 1982</xref>), the latter of which consists of two distinct steps of RNA syntheses. The first step is the complementary RNA (cRNA) synthesis and the second step is the synthesis of vRNA from the cRNA template for the amplification of progeny vRNP. Structural and functional studies indicate that the amino-terminal (N-terminal) end of PB1, the active center subunit for RNA synthesis, is inserted into the cavity of carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain of PA (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Obayashi et al., 2008</xref>), while the C-terminal domain of PB1 interacts with the N-terminal domain of PB2 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>). It has been thought that intermolecular interactions of these subunits and their interactions with host factors are involved in switching the RdRp between transcriptase and replicase and in controlling the 2-step replication of vRNA.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> viral RNA synthesis systems with purified RdRp/vRNP (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kawakami and Ishihama, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al., 1987</xref>) have been used to study the function of the viral RdRp, including the promoter structure (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Parvin et al., 1989</xref>), cap-snatching (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Plotch et al., 1979</xref>), and host factors required for efficient RdRp activity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nagata et al., 1989</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> (cell-based) systems so-called mini-gonome assays, in which a reporter gene is expressed from a model viral genome by RdRp expressed in trans from plasmid vectors or helper virus infection, can be also used to find new RdRp-specific antivirals (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lutz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Ozawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). For these purposes, stable cell lines expressing viral RdRp have been attempted to be established (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et al., 1992</xref>). However, current systems still have limitations and drawbacks and make biochemical analyses difficult to achieve.</p><p>One of the limitations is the instability of purified RdRp. The vRNP purified from virions is relatively stable, but further purification using micrococcal nuclease or cesium chloride (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Seong et al., 1992</xref>), by which NP and vRNA molecules are dissociated, lowers the specific activity of the RdRp (activity per mass). Sole expression of each RdRp subunit in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells is known to result in protein aggregation and <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of the active RdRp complex has not been established. In transfection-based systems, although the expression levels and the ratio of RdRp subunits in total cells can be controlled by the DNA amounts used for transfection, they varied in each cell. If one of the RdRp subunits does not express well in a cell, the other subunits become dead-end products. Indeed, previous reports indicated that serial affinity purifications after reconstitution of vRNP were required to eliminate such dead-end products (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jorba et al., 2008</xref>). Multi-subunit complexes such as influenza virus RdRp are needed to be correctly assembled for their activity, and this is possible only when all the subunits are equally expressed in individual cells, such as stable cell lines expressing the three subunits. However, it is time-consuming and complicated to select cell clones expressing the three RdRp subunits by the RdRp activity-based screening.</p><p>We aimed to efficiently reconstitute multi-subunit complexes such as viral RdRp and vRNP complexes in culture cells. To this end, we constructed a polycistronic expression vector in which three coding sequences (CDSs) of RdRp subunits are concatenated in-frame with the CDS of <italic>Thosea asigna</italic> virus 2A-like self-processing sequence of the capsid precursor protein (referred to as TaV2A) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pringle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al., 2001a</xref>), and reconstituted the active RdRp at single cell levels. The 2A/2A-like peptides are approximately 20 amino acids in length and are encoded in various virus genomes such as picornaviruses (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Luke et al., 2008</xref>). For this purpose, the 2A sequence of foot-and-mouth disease virus has been studied in most detail (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 1991</xref>). The molecular mechanisms of self-processing have been suggested as follows. The translation of self-processing 2A sequence is terminated at the penultimate glycyl residue and restarts at the last prolyl residue without connecting these glycyl-prolyl residues by a peptide bond (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al., 2001b</xref>). Resultant upstream protein has 2A sequence until the penultimate glycine at the C-terminal end and downstream protein has an additional proline at the N-terminal end after self-processing. In this report, we employ TaV2A-dependent polycistronic expression systems and show efficient reconstitution of functional (biologically active) influenza A virus RdRp. We also discuss not only these advantages, but also the drawbacks about self-processing 2A sequence-based polycistronic expression systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Virus Strain, Antibodies, and Cell Lines</title><p>Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain was used throughout this work.

At hybridization sites of primers for semiquantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) as shown in our previous report (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Momose et al., 2011</xref>), PCR-based synonymous substitutions of pPolI-PR8-x were carried out using mutated primer sets (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>). Consequently, neither the modified vectors (pPolI-modPR8-x) nor its transcripts are detectable by using the original qPCR primers. For the standard DNA of the modified segment-specific qPCR, the plasmid (pBSmodPR8qPCRSTD) which contains one copy each of eight amplicons was constructed as previously reported (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Momose et al., 2011</xref>).

A unique <italic>Xho</italic> I site followed by a Kozak sequence (Kz) was added to the upstream end of the &#x003b1; fragment. The authentic stop codons at the downstream ends of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; fragments were replaced by the TaV2A peptide CDSs (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1D</xref></bold>, TaV2A<sub>1</sub>, TaV2A<sub>2</sub>, and TaV2A<sub>3</sub> for PB1, PB2, and PA fragments, respectively) with X-TaV2A<sub>n</sub>-GRGSct-rev and TaV2A<sub>n</sub>-g/aGRGS-rev primers. The original TaV2A nucleotide sequences were derived from pDON-5 OKSLN (Takara Bio, Japan) and the TaV2A<sub>1</sub>, TaV2A<sub>2</sub>, and TaV2A<sub>3</sub> nucleotide sequences contained synonymous substitutions (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1D</xref></bold>) to prevent homologous recombination in host cells.

TaV2A peptide-positive events were separated from 1&#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> total events on a dot plot of FS-Lin versus FL1-Log. For cell cycle analysis, singlet events were chosen from 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> total events on a dot plot of FL3-Lin versus AUX.

Primer-independent negative-strand RNA synthesis (cRNA to vRNA replication) occurs by the reconstituted RdRp, resulting in the formation of the vRNP complex. This reconstituted vRNP is used for the primer-dependent mRNA synthesis catalyzed by the RdRp (vRNA to mRNA transcription), leading to expression of luciferase as a reporter. The reconstituted vRNP is also used for the next step of replication, primer-independent positive-strand RNA synthesis (vRNA to cRNA replication). The use of cRNA as an initial RNA assures that the reconstituted RdRp is functional and has both replication and transcription activities.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p><bold>Reconstitution of functional vRNP by various combinations of the RdRp expression vectors.</bold>

The reconstitution of functional RdRp/vRNP complex was assessed by luciferase activity (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,E</xref></bold>). The expression levels of RdRp subunits, especially PB2 and PA, from polycistronic expression vectors were low, as compared with those expressed from monocistronic vectors (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,D</xref></bold>, compare lanes two and 3&#x02013;8). It is likely that the translation resume at the TaV2A sequence of the polycistronic mRNA was inefficient and/or that the protein with the TaV2A-derived residues was unstable.</p><p>Mini-genome assays (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,E</xref></bold>) showed that the luciferase activities were detected only in the presence of all three RdRp subunits (columns 2&#x02013;8) but that the levels varied, depending on the combination of vectors and the subunit CDS orders. In tricistronic ORF expression, PB1 was clearly detected even though the protein levels were slightly lower than that produced by monocistronic PB1 expression, whereas the levels of tricistronically expressed PB2 and PA were very low or below the detection limit (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>). Mini-genome assays, however, revealed that the luciferase activities were not similar levels in the tricistronic ORF vectors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref></bold>). The luciferase expression by the PB1-PA-PB2 and PB1-PB2-PA (referred to as 1a2 and 12a) ORF vectors markedly increased up to four to fivefolds (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref></bold>, columns 3 and 4). The luciferase expression by the a12 and a21 ORF vectors (columns 7 and 8) was equivalent to that of the control sample and that by the 21a and 2a1 ORF vectors was not detected (columns 5 and 6). These results indicated that the quantity of functional RdRp complex reconstituted in cells did not correlate with the protein levels of RdRp subunits expressed in the cells.</p><p>More importantly, these observations suggest that the reconstitution efficiency of functional RdRp complex is greatly influenced by the most upstream CDS of a tricistronic ORF. This trend was also observed in combinations of bicistronic and monocistronic vectors. A comparison of the 12 and 21 ORF vectors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>, 12+PA and 21+PA) indicated that PB1 CDS at the upstream resulted in the increase of reporter expression by threefold (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref></bold>, compare columns 3 and 5). A similar increase was observed for the 1a and a1 ORF vectors (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref></bold>, columns 4 and 7). Taken together, these results suggest that the PB1 CDS at the most upstream of polycistronic ORF is preferable for efficient reconstitution of functional RdRp. Both PA and PB2 CDSs were tolerant at the most downstream in tricistronic ORFs (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref></bold>, compare columns 3 and 4), suggesting that addition of the 19 residues of the linker and processed TaV2A sequence to the C-terminal end of PB2 or PA does not prevent reconstitution of functional RdRp.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteasomal Degradation of the PA Protein Expressed from the Downstream of TaV2A Sequence</title><p>Tricistronic RdRp expression systems allowed for efficient reconstitution of functional RdRp with three subunits. Although the levels of PB2 and PA were sufficient for catalytic assays such as a mini-genome assay, they appeared insufficient for purification of reconstituted vRNP as protein sources such as structural studies. To improve the yield of functional RdRp, we tested the following three methods: One was a mutagenic approach by which the expression of the downstream protein was expected to be improved to the stoichiometric amounts. Another was the establishment of stable cell lines expressing RdRp to ensure the RdRp expression in all cells without transfection. The other was increasing the scale of cell culture followed by affinity purification.</p><p>First, using the bicistronic 1a ORF vector (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>), we introduced amino acid deletions or substitutions into the TaV2A sequence and explored whether the inefficient downstream translation was rescued by the mutations (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref></bold>). However, none of the mutants we tested showed any improvement of the downstream PA expression. It has been known that the type of residues (e.g., F, W, Y, L, I, R, K, and H) at the N-terminal end significantly reduce the protein half-life (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Varshavsky, 1997</xref>). In the 1a ORF construct, the downstream PA expressed from this bicistronic vector contained a M1P substitution (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>). We speculated that this unique mutation decreased PA protein half-life. In fact, the downstream PA was stabilized in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Goldberg, 1998</xref>) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>, lane 6; <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref></bold>, lane 4), indicating that the apparently decreased expression of the downstream PA was likely due to the M1P substitution but not to inefficient translation resume at the TaV2A sequence. Then, we modified the N-terminal end of the downstream PA. Because the first proline cannot be changed in the 2A/2A-like sequence self-processing system, we substituted the second glutamate (E2X) which possibly affected the protein half-life. However, none of E2X mutants we tested showed any improvement of protein stability (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref></bold>). The only case showing stabilization of the downstream PA was that the original first methionine was restored between N-terminal end proline and the second glutamate, i.e., 1a(Met) ORF vector (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>, lane 9), resulting in one proline extension to the N-terminal end of wild-type PA sequence (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p><bold>Stabilization of the downstream PA expressed from the 1a ORF by amino-terminal mutation or treatment with proteasomal inhibitor MG132.</bold>

However, the reconstitution efficiency of functional RdRp did not correlate with the stability of the downstream PA. When we reconstituted RdRp using the bicistronic 1a(Met) ORF vector with the monocistronic PB2 vector, the luciferase activity became lower than that by the original 1a ORF and the monocistronic PB2 vectors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref></bold>, compare columns 5 and 9). This result suggests that only one addition of proline at the N-terminal end of PA resulted in a significant decrease of the reconstitution efficiency of functional RdRp. We found that treatment with MG132 abolished the luciferase expression (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref></bold>, even number columns), consistent with a previous study in which RNA synthesis of influenza virus was inhibited in the presence of MG132 (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Widjaja et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Establishment of Stable Cell Lines with Polycistronic Expression Vector</title><p>Next, we attempted to establish stable cell lines expressing RdRp. Cotransfection of the monocistronic expression vectors for each subunit requires selection of cell clones by three different resistant markers to ensure expression of the three subunits otherwise by RdRp activity-based screening. In contrast, the use of polycistronic expression vector with a single selection marker was expected to allow for expression of all the three subunits in individual cells, leading to the efficient reconstitution of functional RdRp. Furthermore, it is often experienced that when a target gene and a drug resistance gene are coexpressed from different loci, the expression of the target gene is suppressed despite acquisition of the drug resistance. Thus, we added the HygR CDS to the downstream of the polycistronic and monocistronic ORFs (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). The acquisition of HygB resistance by HygR ensures the expression of the upstream RdRp CDSs.</p><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were transfected with the polycistronic vectors.

After several passages, the clone No. 5 was analyzed by flow cytometer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-07-00288-g004"/></fig><p>Then, we carried out cell selection with HygB. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold> (HygB), the percentages of AcGFP- and NP-positive cells markedly increased to 98.1 and 97.4%, respectively. The percentages of cells expressing the RdRp subunits also increased to 11.6&#x02013;69.3% when compared with the rate by G418 selection. Among these RdRp cases, there was a trend that the positive rate was relatively high when the ORF contained the PA CDS (1aHygR, a2HygR, and PAHygR).</p><p>Next, we carried out cloning of the stable cell lines. We constructed 1a2HygR ORF derivatives in which the One-STrEP/Twin-Strep tag CDS (os) (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>) was inserted between the PB2 CDS and the HygR CDS to allow affinity purification (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). The 1a2osHygR ORF vector was linearized with <italic>Kpn</italic> I at the f1 <italic>ori</italic> region and was transfected to the MDCK cells. The HygB-resistant cell population was selected and was subjected to limiting dilution cloning to establish stable cell lines expressing RdRp (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref></bold>). Despite cell cloning, the expression level of RdRp in each cell varied, ranging from strongly positive [mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) &#x0003e;200] to below the visual detection limit (MFI &#x0003c;100). Clone No. 5 was composed of cells with relatively high level of expression. After several additional passages, we measured again the RdRp expression level by flow cytometer (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). The positive rate of 1a2osHygR clone No. 5 was slightly higher (18.5%) than that of the heterogenous 1a2HygR cell population (11.6%). It is possible that the polycistronic RdRp-HygR expression tends to be quickly silenced to a minimum expression level required to maintain drug resistance.</p><p>Since the growth of HygB-resistant cells expressing all RdRp subunits was extremely slow, we explored the possibility of cell cycle arrest by using Cell-Clock Assay (Biocolor), a colorimetric detection of the cell cycle phase (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5A</xref></bold>) and by measuring DNA content by flow cytometry (<bold>Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5B,C</xref></bold>). Although results did not show the cell cycle arrest in the RdRp expressing cells, this cell line displayed aberrant cell morphology such as cell enlargement (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5A</xref></bold>, left side), confirming high forward scatter in flow cytometry (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5B</xref></bold>, FS Lin vs FL1 Log of RdRp).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of Reconstituted vRNP Complex</title><p>We used a large volume of the cell lysates, in which RdRp was polycistronically expressed, and attempted to isolate the reconstituted single segment vRNP. To this end, single polycistronic expression vector (1a2 or 1a2os ORF) or three monocistronic vectors (PB2os, PB1, and PA) for the RdRp subunits were cotransfected with the NP and cRNA expression vectors into HEK293T cells. The cell lysates were subjected to streptavidin-based affinity pull-down assay. The viral proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) and vRNA were eluted from the affinity beads and were analyzed by Western blotting and polarity-specific qPCR, respectively. In this polycistronic expression system, we used cRNA as an initial RNA transcribed from the RNA expression vector (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>), thereby ensuring the polarity-specific vRNA quantification.</p><p>When equal volumes of lysates were used for this affinity pull-down, the level of PB2os extracted from the polycistronic RdRp expression sample was about 10-fold lower than that of the monocistronic expression sample (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref></bold>, anti-PB2, compare lanes 4 and 5). Since our polycistronic expression system did not produce high levels of PA and PB2os, we used large volumes of the cell lysates and compared the coprecipitation efficiencies of vRNA and NP per RdRp with the efficiency obtained by monocistronic expression system. When 10-fold excess volumes of the polycistronically expressed cell lysates were used for affinity pull-down, the level of extracted PB2os was comparable to that obtained from the monocistronically expressed cell lysates (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref></bold>, anti-PB2, compare lanes 4 and 7). In this condition, the levels of coprecipitated PB1 and PA, were also comparable (anti-PB1/PA, lanes 4 and 7). From these results, the levels of precipitated RdRp were considered as nearly equivalent. A careful observation indicated, however, that only a trace of NP was coprecipitated in the monocistronic expression system (anti-NP, lane 4). The RdRp consists of equimolar PB2, PB1, and PA subunits and the vRNP complex contains one set of RdRp, one copy of viral RNA and excess molar of NP. It is possible that the RdRp complex but not the vRNP complex was preferentially formed in the monocistronic expression system.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p><bold>Affinity pull-down assay of reconstituted vRNP.</bold>

From these results, we concluded that, though 10-fold volume of cell lysate was required to obtain an equal quantity of RdRp, the polycistronic RdRp expression system allowed for the reconstitution of vRNP complex and for the isolation of the complex by one-step affinity purification.

This expression system allowed us to obtain reconstituted vRNP with less purification steps and also to establish stable cell lines expressing RdRp, a viral multi-subunit complex. We suggest that the efficient reconstitution of RdRp and vRNP may allow more detailed functional analyses such as the residues of RdRp necessary for viral transcription and RNA genome replication for full understanding of the influenza virus multiplication. A higher specific activity of vRNP (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>) achieved by an efficient reconstitution (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>), may allow us to increase the sensitivity of drug screenings such as mini-genome assays.

If a large quantity of RdRp is required for studies, such as a crystal structure analysis, the expression systems using insect viruses are advantageous (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Reich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hengrung et al., 2015</xref>).

However, it is uncertain whether the RdRp/vRNP complex reconstituted in these cells are functionally identical with that reconstituted in a mammalian cells. In contrast, MDCK and HEK293T cells are infection-permissive and have commonly been used to reconstitute these multi-subunit complexes by cotransfection of monocistronic expression vectors. However, as shown in this study, the reconstitution efficiency of functional RdRp/vRNP complex was considerably low because the ratio of RdRp subunits varies in each cell.</p><p>One advantage of self-processing 2A-based polycistronic expression is to ensure coexpression of multiple proteins in a single cell, suggesting potential applications requiring the biological quality, i.e., the uniformity and reproducibility of the expression ratio, rather than the quantity. By this approach, we explored the reconstitution of functional RdRp complex and vRNP complex with a TaV2A-based polycistronic RdRp expression vector. The reconstitution efficiency of RdRp in the polycistronic expression system was higher than that in the monocistronic expression system (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). If the activity of RdRp was estimated only from protein expression levels in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>, it would be expected that the monocistronic expression sample (lane 2) harbors much higher reporter activity than the others. However, we found that it was not the case. Even though PB2 and PA levels were below the detection limit, polycistronically expressed RdRp from the 12a and 1a2 ORF vectors showed much higher activities (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref></bold>, lanes 3 and 4). This result implies that most of the monocistronically expressed proteins probably exist as incomplete/non-functional complexes or monomers and that the contamination of such defective complex make it difficult to purify the target complex. The improvement of the RdRp reconstitution efficiency allowed us to isolate reconstituted vRNP from a crude cell lysate with lesser purification steps (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). In our polycistronic expression, the levels of PB2 and PA were still low, as compared with those observed in the monocistronic expression, but the reconstitution of vRNP was considerably efficient. We suggest that if the polycistronic expression of downstream PB2 and PA could be stabilized, the reconstitution efficiency would more increase.</p><p>Internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been also used for multiple protein expression from one mRNA/vector (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Thompson, 2012</xref>). However, we believe that the polycistronic expression based on the 2A self-processing has some advantages, as compared with the IRES expression system. A minimum nucleotide length of IRES is 10-fold longer than that of the 2A sequence (about 550&#x02013;600 nt and 60 nt, respectively) and this fact allows to minimize the size of multiple protein expression vector. Another advantage is translation mechanisms for multiple protein expression. IRES is based on the re-entry of ribosomal complex onto an mRNA, whereas the self-processing of 2A/2A-like sequence is thought to progress without dissociation or re-entry of ribosome for downstream translation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al., 2001b</xref>). This serial translation of self-processing 2A/2A-like sequence would better equalize the translation rates of upstream and downstream CDSs.</p><p>Another advantage of the polycistronic expression system is the saving of cellular transcription- and translation-related factors required for expression of multiple proteins. For example, when RdRp and NP were coexpressed from the equimolar ratio of four monocistronic expression vectors, the level of NP expression was markedly reduced, possibly due to the shortage of cellular RNA polymerase II-related factors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>, lane 2). The use of a polycistronic vector could halve the kind of protein expression vectors and eliminate the shortage of cellular transcription- and translation-related factors for their expression (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>, lanes 3&#x02013;8). Therefore, if a large quantity of multi-subunit complexes is wanted as materials for some experiments, it is better to express the subunits polycistronically, but the molar difference of proteins in such a complex should be taken into account, as we expressed the RdRp subunits and NP from different vectors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>).</p><p>The other beneficial use of the self-processing 2A-based expression system is to ensure expression of all the upstream CDSs when a drug-resistant gene is placed at the most downstream in a polycistronic ORF (e.g., <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>, 1a2osHygR ORF). The selection of drug-resistant cells allows us to establish stable cells expressing all the genes we want. The longer an ORF becomes by connecting multiple CDSs, the more frequently a disruption of the ORF occurs, especially when the polycistronic expression vector plasmid integrates into the host genome. If a drug-resistant gene is present at the most downstream in the polycistronic ORF, one can select the cells surely expressing all the upstream genes in the presence of the drug. But if such a selective marker is located in another locus and the ORF of interest destroyed or silenced, one cannot eliminate such cells by drug resistance screening. By this approach, we obtained stable cells, almost all of which expressed fluorescent proteins and NP, without cell cloning (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>, HygB, AcGFP- and NP-HygR).</p></sec><sec><title>Drawbacks and Limitations of the Self-processing 2A-Based Polycistronic Expression</title><p>The major drawback of this expression system is that the TaV2A-derived sequences remain at the ends of the polycistronically expressed proteins. In some cases, the addition of one proline at the N-terminal end of downstream protein and/or the processed 2A/2A-like peptide at the C-terminal end of upstream protein result in the loss of the protein function. If the N- and C-terminal ends of an expressed protein need to be kept intact, the location of the CDS is limited to the most upstream and the most downstream of polycistronic ORF, respectively. If both ends need to be intact, the protein cannot be expressed polycistronically using a self-processing 2A-based vector. It has also reported that in a certain combination of proteins (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum-targeting protein and protein lacking any signal sequence) the CDS order is limited in a polycistronic ORF (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">de Felipe and Ryan, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In this study, when the PB1 CDS was placed at the downstream, the reconstitution of functional RdRp was inefficient (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref></bold>), despite similar levels of PB1 expression (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>), suggesting that not only PB1 expression level but also its N-terminal end residues were important for the RdRp activity. The TaV2A-derived proline residue at the N-terminal end of downstream PB1 may have caused a reduction in the RdRp activity. Many studies have suggested that the PB1 N-terminal region is essential for binding to the PA C-terminal region (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Toyoda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Perez and Donis, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ghanem et al., 2007</xref>) and structural studies have reported that the PB1 N-terminal end is inserted into the cavity of PA C-terminal domain (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Obayashi et al., 2008</xref>). In this polycistronic expression system, downstream protein has M1P substitution (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>), suggesting that in our case, the first proline residue at the N-terminal end of PB1 may have a deleterious effect on PB1-PA binding or the overall structure of RdRp even though the first methionine of PB1 originally penetrates the cavity and is exposed to solvent without forming strong interactions with PA residues.</p><p>We also encountered the instability of the polycistronically expressed protein. For example, the levels of polycistronically expressed PB2 and PA were very low in many cases (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>), whereas the levels of PB1 was comparable regardless of its CDS location in the ORF. We found that harboring TaV2A-derived sequences made at least PA more sensitive to the proteasomal degradation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>). Thus, it is necessary to consider the CDS order and the terminal structure when proteins are expressed in this expression system.</p><p>By using X-HygR ORF vector, we obtained stable cells expressing the RdRp subunits, and more easily those expressing AcGFP and NP (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>, HygB), suggesting that the number and the kind of proteins expressed may influence to the acquisition efficiency of stably expressing cells. We found that when all RdRp subunits were constitutively expressed, the growth of the host cells was impaired or inhibited. We speculated that transcriptional repression of a polycistronic RdRp-HygR ORF caused the loss of drug resistance. Alternatively, expression of RdRp might be somehow stress and possibly have induced abnormal cell morphology and cell death (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5A</xref></bold>), resulting in the elimination of cells expressing high levels of RdRp.</p><p>Another technical disadvantage is that a leaky expression of downstream proteins often occurs in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells transformed with TaV2A-based polycistronic expression vector. In our study, the <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 strain, when transformed with the polycistronic expression vector that contained PA CDS with its start codon at the downstream of TaV2A CDS [e.g., bicistronic 1a(Met) ORF vector], displayed a temperature-sensitive phenotype (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>). Constitutive expression of target proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> requires a prokaryotic promoter and a ribosome binding sequence such as a Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno (SD) sequence (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Shine and Dalgarno, 1974</xref>) immediately upstream of the polycistronic ORF, neither of which is present at a cloning site for target gene in mammalian expression vectors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref></bold>). In this TaV2A-based expression system, however, continuous nine purine bases are present in the TaV2A CDS, are possibly functioned as a SD sequence for a start codon of downstream CDS (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Romero and Garcia, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Blattner et al., 1997</xref>) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p><bold>Temperature-sensitivity of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains transformed with bicistronic PB1-PA expression vectors.</bold>
