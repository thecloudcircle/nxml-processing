The difference-in-differences method isolates the portion of the pre- versus post-retirement contrast in the 0-5&#x000a0;km and 5-10&#x000a0;km bins, respectively, that is due to retirement rather than secular trends. We controlled for secular trends with mothers living 10-20&#x000a0;km away. Adjusted models included fixed effects for power plant, proportion Hispanic, Black, high school educated, and aged &#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;years mothers, and neighborhood poverty and educational attainment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Analyses included 58,909 live births.

The amount of emitted pollution varies, however, based on fuel usage and type, control technologies (e.g., scrubbers), stack heights, and meteorological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While populations living closest to power plants experience higher levels of primary air pollutants, substantial exposure to secondary particulate matter can occur up to 500&#x000a0;km away [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Residential proximity to power plants has been linked to health outcomes such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and adverse birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Coal and oil plants, especially older and less efficient ones, typically emit more pollution than those run on natural gas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Between 2007 and 2016 coal-fired electricity generation dropped by 40% in the U.S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Future coal and oil power plant retirements&#x02013;driven by energy efficiency, abundant and cheap natural gas, and legislation related to climate change&#x02013;may benefit the health of those living nearby.</p><p id="Par17">Another possible result of power plant retirement is improved fertility among nearby populations. Some evidence suggests links between environmental factors and infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but few studies have investigated the role of air pollution on reproductive outcomes such as live birth rates, infertility, and miscarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Three studies have reported associations between traffic-related air pollution and longer time-to-pregnancy, infertility, and spontaneous abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Fewer than expected miscarriages and stillbirths were reported after a coal plant retirement in Croatia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Only Nieuwenhuijsen et al. (2014) have examined the relationship between air pollution and fertility rates in a general population. They reported an association between higher levels of traffic-related pollution and coarse fraction particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5&#x02013;10</sub>) in Barcelona and reduced fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The components of air pollution differ between that generated by traffic and power plants, however, and the authors noted the potential for residual confounding due to their ecological design.</p><p id="Par19">Research suggests that residential proximity to industrial facilities, including power plants, is also associated with adverse mental health outcomes, including stress and depression, due to perceptions of neighborhood disorder and feelings of personal powerlessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This may have implications for fertility based on evidence linking higher levels of stress with difficulty conceiving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">We sought to expand this limited research by capitalizing on a natural experiment when 8 coal and oil power plants retired in California between 2001 and 2011. Natural experiments enable researchers to investigate the impact of modifiable factors or interventions on health outcomes by exploiting changes in exposure that are difficult to manipulate experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Natural experiments effectively randomize exposure, reducing the threat of residual confounding inherent in observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We implemented a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences approach to estimate the association between coal and oil power plant retirements and nearby fertility rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par21">We obtained birth certificate data from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2011 from the California Department of Public Health.

After exclusions (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1, available in Supplement), 558,308 live births took place within 20&#x000a0;km of a retiring coal or oil power plant during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Power plant exposure</title><p id="Par22">We downloaded data on coal and oil power plants in California from the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Markets Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the California EPA Air Resources Board (CARB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These data contained plant latitude and longitude, fuel type, start date, retirement date, and monthly fuel consumption. CARB also provided annual NO<sub>x</sub> emissions data on power plants that retired after 2007. We obtained NO<sub>x</sub> emissions data on the Hunters Point plant from the EPA Air Markets Program database but were unable to locate emissions data on the two smallest power plants that retired in 2002. We included power plants as exposure areas in the analysis if they used coal or oil as a primary fuel (e.g., bituminous coal, distillate fuel oil, and residual fuel oil) and if they retired between 2001 and 2011. Eight California power plants met these criteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), 6 oil and 2 coal. Two power plants were eventually converted to burn biomass, but this transition required additional permitting and took over a year, meaning they were not active during the study period. For simplicity, we refer to the date of retirement from coal or oil use as &#x0201c;retirement,&#x0201d; even if the plant later transitioned to a new fuel.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Location and names of 8 coal and oil power plants in California with year of retirement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12940_2018_388_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">Based on maternal address at the time of delivery, we used QGIS (qgis.org, QGIS Development Team) to identify births that took place within a 20&#x000a0;km radius of one of the eight power plants. In order to assess a gradient of exposure, we assigned each birth to one of three area bins within the larger 20&#x000a0;km-radius circular area: 0-5&#x000a0;km; 5-10&#x000a0;km; and 10-20&#x000a0;km from a power plant. We used these area bins&#x02013;0-5&#x000a0;km; 5-10&#x000a0;km; and 10-20&#x000a0;km&#x02013;and the population of women aged 15&#x02013;44&#x000a0;years living within them as the units of analysis. Next, we applied temporal restriction criteria. We defined births to mothers with an LMP in the year following power plant retirement as unexposed and births to mothers with an LMP between 1 and 2&#x000a0;years prior to power plant retirement as exposed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These definitions had the advantage of providing a one-year washout period and of matching exposed and unexposed periods to account for fixed cohort bias, seasonal trends in fertility, and power plant emissions (which peak during the summer months). We anticipated that fertility trends among women living 10-20&#x000a0;km from power plants would be similar to those located &#x02264;10&#x000a0;km in the absence of power plant retirements. Compared to a&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;km group, the 10-20&#x000a0;km group would experience a smaller change in power plant-related exposure after retirement. Therefore, this 10-20&#x000a0;km group allowed us to control for temporal trends in fertility and isolate changes due to plant retirement.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Identification of exposed and unexposed births based on last menstrual period among California mothers, 2001&#x02013;2011</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12940_2018_388_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Fertility rate</title><p id="Par24">For each of the 8 plants, we estimated the number of women aged 15&#x02013;44&#x000a0;years living within 20&#x000a0;km before and after retirement using block group level data from the closest, non-overlapping censuses: 2000&#x000a0;U.S. census and 2005&#x02013;2009, 2006&#x02013;2010, 2008&#x02013;2012, 2009&#x02013;2013, and 2011&#x02013;2015 American Community Survey (ACS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, the Kings Beach plant retired in December 2002 and we estimated the population before retirement with 2000 census data and the population after retirement with 2005&#x02013;2009 ACS data. When block groups did not fall entirely in specific area bins, we used geographic-area weighting to allocate the population. We operationalized fertility rate as the number of live births per 1000 women aged 15&#x02013;44&#x000a0;years within 5&#x000a0;km, 5-10&#x000a0;km, and 10-20&#x000a0;km of power plants before and after retirement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Neighborhood data</title><p id="Par25">For our primary analysis, we downloaded block group level data on the number of individuals living below the federal poverty threshold and who attained less than a high school education from the 2000&#x000a0;U.S. census and the ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Based on mother&#x02019;s address at the time of birth we linked block group data. In sensitivity analyses we used additional years of ACS data as described below. We also obtained address-level 2005&#x02013;2011 annual foreclosure data across California from CoreLogic (formerly DataQuick), which we assigned based on mother&#x02019;s census block group and infant&#x02019;s birth year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par26">We used a difference-in-differences design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to compare fertility rates within 20&#x000a0;km of power plants before and after retirement.

We used a negative binomial model to estimate the association between power plant retirements and annual fertility rates on the incident rate ratio scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Under the assumption that secular trends are parallel in both groups and that the negative binomial was correctly specified, the resulting difference-in-differences estimator corresponds to log-fertility incidence rate ratio. We obtained the difference-in-differences estimates from the product interaction term of two indicator variables: one for the area bin (i.e., 0-5&#x000a0;km or 5-10&#x000a0;km, with 10-20&#x000a0;km as the reference) and one for exposure (i.e., post-retirement, with pre-retirement as the reference). We hypothesized that we would observe a difference-in-differences estimators greater than 1, representing increased fertility rates in the communities 0-5&#x000a0;km and 5-10&#x000a0;km from the power plants after retirement. We identified predictors of fertility a priori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and controlled for them to increase precision of our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Adjusted models included fixed effects for power plant, and the proportion births to mothers &#x02265;30&#x000a0;years, mothers of Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, and mothers with &#x02264; a high school degree in each plant-area bin. They also included census block group poverty and educational attainment to account for neighborhood characteristics. Finally, we used the estimated parameters of the adjusted negative binomial model to calculate the number of births per 1000 women at the mean values of all covariates. Regression analyses were implemented in Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and R Statistical Software, version 3.3.2 (R-project.org, R Core Team).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p id="Par27">We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, to assess if small numbers were driving the observed associations, we repeated the analysis after omitting Kings Beach and Portola plants, the plants with the fewest women of childbearing age living within 20&#x000a0;km. Second, we stratified the overall analyses by primary fuel type: coal or oil. Third, we implemented a negative exposure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] by randomly selecting 8 operational (i.e., non-retiring) power plants in California. We repeated the analyses using the geographic location of these operating plants and by randomly assigning to them the retirement dates of the original 8 retired plants. An association with the negative exposure control would have suggested that observed temporal changes in fertility were unrelated to power plant retirement.</p><p id="Par28">Demographic shifts, particularly those related to the Great Recession, a period of substantial economic downturn, and the housing foreclosure crisis that peaked in California in the summer of 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], could have influenced our results. Because block group level ACS data only exists in 5-year windows, we included the annual number of block group level foreclosures as an indicator of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and re-ran analyses for the years 2005&#x02013;2011. We also used block group level data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] prior to and after power plant retirements to explore changes in the number and composition of people living near plants after they retired.

This suggests small, variable rates did not drive the observed association.

While the 10-20&#x000a0;km bins controlled for secular trends local to each plant, in order to further assess the possible effect of statewide trends on our results we implemented negative exposure control analysis, using power plants that did not retire during the study period. This included biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, and solar plants. When combining the location of these plants and their surrounding births with the retirement dates of the original eight power plants we found no significant changes in fertility rates (IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1 [95% CI: 0.8&#x02013;1.3] and IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1 [95% CI: 0.9&#x02013;1.3] in the 0-5&#x000a0;km and 5-10&#x000a0;km bins, respectively, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4).

We observed a gradient, fertility increased the most within 5&#x000a0;km and to a lesser extent within 5-10&#x000a0;km.

Fecundability (i.e., the probability of conception) may have improved. Even exposure to relatively low levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and ozone has been associated with changes in sperm morphology and increases in sperm containing increased DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In a Czech study of 1916 couples, a 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> level was associated with a 22% reduction in fecundability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Air pollution may lead to oxidative stress or endocrine disruption that could explain observed changes in sperm and conception more broadly. In vitro fertilization studies have also demonstrated associations between some&#x02013;NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub>&#x02013;but not all, air pollutants and disrupted fertilization and implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Prior literature has reported changes of a similar magnitude in fertility associated with air pollution exposures. While traffic and power plant air pollution differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], traffic studies provide information about potential mechanisms of action related to increased fertility. Nieuwenhuiisen (2014) found a 13% reduction in census tract fertility rates with IQR increases in PM<sub>2.5&#x02013;10</sub> from traffic in Barcelona, Spain during 2011&#x02013;2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A study using data from 116,430 nurses on self-reported infertility (defined as attempting to become pregnant for one year without success) found an 11% increase in the hazard of infertility among women living &#x0003c;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;m (versus &#x02265;200&#x000a0;m) from a major roadway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Self-reported data indicated that ovulatory disorder and male infertility may have driven these associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Texas and Michigan, among 393 couples attempting to conceive, couples were 3% more likely to become pregnant for each additional 200&#x000a0;m they lived away from a major roadway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These changes in fertility may result from endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, or DNA modifications caused by pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">A reduction in spontaneous abortion may also help explain our findings. As many as 10&#x02013;20% of clinically recognized pregnancies end in a pregnancy loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and research has shown that these rates increase following period of stress, such as natural disasters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our results are consistent with evidence that reports associations between pollutant exposures and increased fetal loss. One study found reduced miscarriage and stillbirth following the temporary closure of a coal plant in Croatia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Two observational studies (350,000 and 750,000 live births, respectively) in New Jersey and Ohio found elevated odds of stillbirth (versus live birth) with increased exposure to ambient SO<sub>2</sub>, carbon monoxide, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the third trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

For instance, if residential proximity was related to employment at the power plants, closure may have resulted in more job loss among individuals living closer to the power plants (i.e., &#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;km). We do not have data to assess this pathway, but job loss would have likely reduced fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], biasing our results towards the null. In addition, other aspects of power plants could have affected fertility rates. Some studies suggest a link between industrial activities and stress, which have been associated with reduced fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">We assessed whether compositional changes and economic improvement around power plants after retirement might have explained our results. First, we restricted the unexposed period to the single year after power plant retirement, limiting compositional changes that may have occurred over longer periods of time. Second, using ACS data we found minimal changes in population composition, such as small changes in neighborhood poverty following plant retirements. We also assessed whether changes in the housing market due to the foreclosure crisis affected fertility, unrelated to contemporaneous power plant retirements. Models adjusted for the number of annual foreclosures by area bin did not differ from our original results. This adjustment, however, may have been insufficient if temporal changes in foreclosures differed by area bin pre- and post-retirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Finally, we used communities located 10-20&#x000a0;km from power plants as controls under the assumption that they might have had similar composition to communities located closer but would experience smaller changes in air pollution due to power plant retirements. The choice of control group may have produced conservative estimates, since pollutants from coal plants can travel over 10&#x000a0;km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Assessment of spatial and temporal exposures has been noted as a methodological concern in studies of air pollution and reproductive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Our design, utilizing a natural experiment of plant closures, addresses these issues through specification of exposure location and timing. As fertility did not cause the closing of plants, staggered closing dates allowed us to approximate a randomized design using difference-in-differences methods.</p><p id="Par42">Our study had several limitations. Because fertility is governed by both biological and behavioral factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], our outcome variable (i.e., the fertility rate) lacks specificity to identify pure biological effects. The estimated benefit of power plant retirement for area-level fertility rate may not apply to individual couples attempting to conceive. In addition, the fertility rate denominator estimate included error. The ACS provides population estimates at the block group level in 5-year windows, not annually, and block groups did not perfectly overlap with our selected area bins. Furthermore, we assumed a constant population density of women 15&#x02013;44&#x000a0;years across block groups, which also added uncertainty to fertility rate estimates. Several of the plants had a relatively small number of births occur within 20&#x000a0;km, which could have resulted in variable rates and spurious associations. To assess this issue, we repeated analysis after removing the two plants with the fewest women of childbearing age nearby and noted no qualitative change in results. We also lacked air quality measurements at mothers&#x02019; homes or places of work meaning we could not account for varying levels of background air pollution or identify a single pollutant as the potential causative agent. However, CMAQ PM<sub>2.5</sub> data did suggest more reduction in air pollution closer to power plants after retirement. Future analyses could explore whether other sources of air pollution, for example biomass plants or traffic, contribute to changes in fertility. Two of the eight power plants eventually transitioned to burning biomass, which release air pollutants. Such transitions take time. For example, the Port of Stockton coal plant retired in January of 2011 and did not reopen to burn biomass until February of 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We treated these transitions, therefore, as retirements for the purpose of this study where we compared the year after retirement to the period 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;years prior. In addition, we assigned exposure based on the residential address on the birth certificate and could not account for exposure accrued from work, travel, or residential mobility during pregnancy. We were unable to assess the association of plant closures with neighborhood perceptions and maternal stress. Finally, an assumption of our difference-in-differences analysis is that secular trends in fertility in the 10-20&#x000a0;km area bin mirror that of the &#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;km and 5-10&#x000a0;km area bins, conditional on measured covariates. Although the demographics of the distance bins may have exhibited some differences over the study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], unadjusted and adjusted estimates were similar, suggesting that any differences in the measured covariates over time did not confound our results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">Our results indicate potential fertility benefits associated with coal and oil power plant retirements in California. These results require confirmation in other populations, given known methodological limitations of ecologic study designs. The two coal-fired generators retired in this study had capacities&#x02013;54&#x000a0;MW and 24&#x000a0;MW&#x02013;about 1 order of magnitude lower than the nationwide average coal plant. Therefore, we might expect stronger associations in other locations. The U.S. EIA has identified nearly 7000&#x000a0;MW of coal and oil capacity in 8 states slated for retirement in 2018 alone. The Clean Power Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]&#x02013;the federal government&#x02019;s strategy to curb carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation&#x02013;and similar climate change policies will also likely lead to more power plant retirements as states strive to meet emissions standards. Our study design limited the possibility that the estimated increase in fertility rates after coal and oil power plant retirements resulted from temporal trends or changes in population composition. Ecologic designs have known methodological limitations, however, so our results require confirmation in other populations.
