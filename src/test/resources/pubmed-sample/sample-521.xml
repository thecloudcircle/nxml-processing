Mucus obstruction causes local hypoxia, favoring proliferation of facultative anaerobic pathogens including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> which maintain chronic airway inflammation and trigger acute flares of the diseases. The hypoxic tissue milieu itself can also initiate a sterile inflammatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The excessive lung inflammation in muco-obstructive diseases involves elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-8 often detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or sputum of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Maturation and release of IL-1&#x003b2; and other cytokines of the IL-1 class is regulated via activation of inflammasomes; cytosolic multiprotein complexes aggregated around a sentinel protein such as NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3), NLRC4 (NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4) and AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2). It is not always feasible to differentiate sterile from pathogen-induced inflammation in clinical presentations of muco-obstructive disease. Previous studies showed that signalling via the IL-1R/MyD88 axis is indispensable in the inflammatory response by the airway epithelium and neutrophils to mucus obstruction-associated hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although activation of inflammasome(s) by mucus obstruction, upstream of the IL-1R/MyD88 signalling, is likely in these settings, little is known about the nature of the inflammasome(s) involved.</p><p id="Par6">Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a small bioactive lipid that regulates many cellular processes. Generation of S1P inside the cell from sphingosine is mediated by two sphingosine kinases (SPHKs), SPHK1 mostly in cytosol, and SPHK2 in intracellular organelles. S1P signalling leads to diverse or even opposing cellular effects, via intracellular targets, or membrane-bound receptors S1PR1&#x02013;5 at the cell surface (&#x02018;inside-out&#x02019; S1P signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). In the latter pathway, S1P is exported via some membrane transporters, of which Spinster homologue 2 (SPNS2) has recently been shown to be functional in physiologic settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. S1P signalling is part of the &#x02018;sphingolipid rheostat&#x02019; regulatory system in which S1P and ceramides and sphingosine usually induce effects opposing to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Increase in ceramides is a common feature and potential cause of the increased cell death, inflammation and susceptibility to infections in the airway of muco-obstructive diseases including CF, COPD and cigarette smoke-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Relevant to a mechanistic relationship between inflammasome pathways and sphingolipid signalling, intracellular ceramides have been shown to be directly sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Less is known on the alteration of S1P signalling and its role in muco-obstructive diseases. Previous studies by us and others indicated complex dysregulation of the S1P signalling system in COPD (and in response to cigarette smoke) involving several components and various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Large gaps in this field remain, especially whether and how individual components of the S1P signalling system are dysregulated in diseases such as CF, COPD, non-CF bronchiectasis, and whether mucus obstruction directly contributes to this dysregulation. .</p><p id="Par7">In this study we employed a well-characterized mouse model of muco-obstructive disease elicited by overexpression of the beta-unit of the epithelial sodium channel (&#x003b2;ENaC) specifically in the airway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to explore the hypothesis that mucus obstruction can enhance both NLRP3 inflammasome activation and dysregulated S1P signalling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="Par8">Primary antibodies included rabbit polyclonal to SPHK1 and SPHK2 (Bs-2652R and Bs-2653R, Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA, both 1:50), NLRP3 and IL-1&#x003b2; (sc-66,846 and sc-7884, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA, both 1:40), GLUT1 (Glucose Transporter 1, ab652, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:100), goat polyclonal antibody to SPNS2 (sc-165,572, Santa Cruz, 1:40), TNF&#x003b1; (sc-1348, Santa Cruz, 1:50), myeloperoxidase (#2141, Osenses, Adelaide, SA, Australia, 1:100), and a mouse monoclonal antibody to neutrophil elastase (M0752, Dako GmbH, Jena, Germany, 1:100).

Tissue sections cut at 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thickness were mounted in tissue arrays (single section from each animal, 4 sections per array), so all animals could be examined in parallel and no batch controls of intensity were required. The signal intensity of each marker was controlled by antibody titrations in preliminary experiments. The fluorescence digital intensities in the confocal images were controlled by setting the laser power (0.1 to 5%), voltage and digital gain, so that when a uniform setting was applied to all samples (including the negative controls) in each batch, the dullest samples well exceeded the negative staining controls, while the brightest samples did not reach digital saturation. In each batch, the negative staining controls included sections incubated with only the mix of three secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG AF594, anti-goat IgG AF488, anti-mouse IgG AF647). Ten to 20 independent bronchioles in each sample were photographed from an area of 0. 3-0.5&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> under a 60x objective of a FV3000 confocal system (Olympus Corporation, Shinzuku, Tokyo, Japan). The optical fields were selected in the DAPI channel to prevent bias. Monochromatic photographs were analysed using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA). For quantitative analysis, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of staining in the bronchial epithelia was measured from each photo and the background intensity of the relevant negative control was subtracted. A mean value from at least 10 images was then calculated for each animal. For analysis of strongly heterogeneous staining as for TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and NLRP3, a lower threshold of intensity was set relatively high to gate out dull/moderate fluorescence (below the threshold) from bright specks, which were then counted using the &#x0201c;particle analysis&#x0201d; function, and normalized to number of nuclei counted in the DAPI channel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Histology</title><p id="Par11">For exact histological localization of immunostaining patterns, following confocal imaging, sections were re-stained with Alcian Blue/PAS or H&#x00026;E, then scanned with a NanoZoomer digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan). Mucus plaques or plugs seen under confocal microscopy as intraluminal nonstructural masses were all confirmed in Alcian Blue/PAS scans. Levels of mucus obstruction were measured by percentage ratio between Alcian Blue/PAS-positive bronchiolar sites and the total number of bronchiolar sites in each lung section. Myeloid foci containing more than 20 nuclei were counted from whole scans, then normalized to lung area in square centimeters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par12">Data was analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Mann-Whitney tests, paired t-tests and Spearman&#x02019;s correlation as appropriate, and were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., California, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>&#x003b2;ENaC overexpression induced patchy mucus obstruction and neutrophil-dominant infiltration in mouse airways</title><p id="Par13">Comparison of &#x003b2;ENaC-overexpressing mice to wild type controls confirmed substantial induction of airway mucus obstruction seen as plaques on bronchiolar luminal surfaces and masses plugging parts of bronchioles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In accordance with our previous finding of lung function heterogeneity in &#x003b2;ENaC mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], mucus obstruction in their lungs revealed patchy patterns. Within the same &#x003b2;ENaC lung, parts of the bronchioles looked relatively intact while others were seen with mucus plaques, or entirely plugged with mucus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The &#x003b2;ENaC lung revealed leucocyte infiltration seen as compact foci in submucosal parenchyma, and cells diffused in mucus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Quantitative analysis of whole NanoZoomer scans confirmed statistically significant increases in both mucus obstruction and infiltration foci in &#x003b2;ENaC lungs compared to controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d). Using neutrophil markers myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase, leucocyte infiltration of mucus plaques and plugs was shown to be neutrophil-dominant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

As normal mouse airway epithelia always show dull/moderate staining of cytokines and inflammasome proteins, quantitative particle analysis by ImageJ was applied to screen in only bright immunofluorescence specks. In line with previous findings that lung inflammation in &#x003b2;ENaC-overexpressing mice is driven by TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], increased bright speck staining of this cytokine was detected globally in the lungs of &#x003b2;ENaC-overexpressing mice compared to control animals. Bright TNF&#x003b1; staining was localized to alveoli and bronchioles, irrespective of mucus obstruction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Compared to TNF&#x003b1;, distribution of NLRP3 and IL-1&#x003b2; specks showed a marked difference. While the wild type control bronchiolar epithelia (as well as unobstructed bronchiolar epithelia of the tested &#x003b2;ENaC animals) revealed only small, sporadic specks with predominantly homogenous fluorescence of NLRP3, increased speck staining for NLRP3 was detected at the apical epithelial surface near mucus plugs and plaques, and in intraluminal mucus masses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Similar patterns of increased speck immunofluorescence associated with mucus obstruction were observed for IL-1&#x003b2;, which was shown localized to the same site as NLRP3 in consecutive serial sections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Infiltrating cells in mucus plaques and plugs were often seen associated with increased NLRP3 and IL-1&#x003b2; (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The epithelium at and near the mucus obstruction sites displayed a trend to increased apical immunofluorescence of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, a marker of hypoxia), while endogenous IgG was highly distributed in mucus plaques and plugs (Figs. S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Negative control staining inserted in each batch showed no nonspecific binding of conjugated antibodies to mucus and other tissues (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Thus, unlike the increase in TNF&#x003b1; specks which showed global distribution in &#x003b2;ENaC airways, increased specks of NLRP3, IL-1&#x003b2;, and intraluminal IgG were confined to airways at or near sites of mucus obstruction.

Increased bright specks of NLRP3 and IL-1&#x003b2; detected in the lung of &#x003b2;ENaC overexpressing mice were highly localized to the vicinity of mucus plaques and plugs. Specks vs. homogenous fluorescence reflects oligomeric vs. monomeric states and is a method for the detection of NLRP3 inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the lungs, measurement of IL-1&#x003b2;/IL-18 in BAL is a commonly accepted technique to detect inflammasome activation, particularly in mouse studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Due to unavailability of BAL samples, the mentioned approach could not be done in this study, although detection of IL-1&#x003b2; in luminal spaces or at epithelial surfaces indicated the cytokine release. Next, although apical membrane patterns of NLRP3/ IL-1&#x003b2; specks near obstruction sites indicate their epithelial origin, specks were seen embedded in mucus containing infiltrating neutrophils and other leucocytes, supporting a myeloid origin. A precise contribution from each cell type and/or reduced mucociliary clearance into the bright intraluminal staining of obstructed bronchioles could not be assessed from this study. The localization of NLRP3/IL-1&#x003b2; specks to and near mucus obstruction sites irrespectively of their origin nevertheless supported the hypothesis that NLRP3 inflammasome activation could be enhanced downstream of mucus obstruction.
<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Hypothetical model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and S1P signalling dysregulation in mucus-obstructed bronchioles. Unobstructed bronchioles (AIR): NLRP3 is mostly in monomeric state, only background levels of cleaved IL-1&#x003b2; are detected; SPHK1 generates cytosolic S1P, part of which is exported via SPNS2 for extracellular (inside-out) signalling via S1PRs; SPHK2 generates S1P mostly for intracellular signalling. Obstructed bronchioles (MUCUS): Increased oligomerization of NLRP3 (inflammasome activation) in either epithelium or infiltrating leucocytes results in IL-1&#x003b2; cleavage and increased luminal specks of NLRP3/IL-1&#x003b2;; decrease of SPNS2 and SPHK2 results in reduction of extra- and intracellular S1P signalling</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12950_2020_248_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">IL-1&#x003b1; released from hypoxia-induced necrosis in non-myeloid cells has been implicated in activation of the IL-1R/MyD88 axis and initiation of neutrophilic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, evidence of the NLRP3/IL-1&#x003b2; pathway activation in a direct association with HIF-1&#x003b1; was obtained from a rat model of hypoxia and thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], prompting us to explore an association between NLRP3/IL-1&#x003b2; specks and local hypoxia. In this study, GLUT1 was employed as an in situ marker of hypoxia, which revealed however only a non-significant trend towards increased apical immunofluorescence near the mucus plugs. Further studies are thus required to demonstrate mucus obstruction-associated hypoxia as a causal factor in airway NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Given that immune complexes are capable of priming the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], an additional factor in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the &#x003b2;ENaC overexpression model could be the high concentration of IgG observed in mucus plaques and plugs.</p><p id="Par20">Consistent with our findings in the lungs of mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the mouse model of &#x003b2;ENaC overexpression revealed bronchiolar epithelial SPNS2 downregulation, with the notable difference that SPNS2 downregulation in &#x003b2;ENaC-overexpressing mice was localized to mucus obstruction sites. The intense and colocalized expression of SPNS2 and SPHK1 at the apex of intact bronchiolar epithelia supports this cell type as a major generator of exogenous S1P in the airways. Epithelial SPNS2 downregulation at mucus obstruction sites would lead to reduced S1P export and subsequent signalling via autocrine/paracrine ligation of S1PRs on the surface of epithelial and/or other cell types. A further important finding from this study was a significant downregulation of bronchiolar epithelial SPHK2 expression at mucus obstruction sites in the lung of &#x003b2;ENaC over-expressing mice. In contrast to SPHK1 localization to the cytosol and near the cell membrane, SPHK2 was localized to mitochondria and nuclei, suggesting its role in regulation of intracellular autocrine production of S1P. Taken together, these findings suggest that both the &#x02018;inside-out&#x02019; and the intracellular S1P signalling pathways are dysregulated in the lungs of &#x003b2;ENaC mice, and that these defects are associated with mucus obstruction. Depending on the subcellular compartmentalization of S1P generation and the cell types involved, S1P signalling leads to diverse effects, including those offsetting the effects of ceramides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Given that ceramides are increased in muco-obstructive diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and that they can directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a decrease in S1P signaling may have a role in amplification of the pro-inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par21">In conclusion, our results support NLRP3 inflammasome activation and S1P signalling dysregulation in the lung disease elicited by &#x003b2;ENaC overexpression, and that both features are associated with mucus obstruction. Our data suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome and the S1P signalling system could represent potential contributors to pathology and therefore putative therapeutic targets in CF, COPD and other muco-obstructive respiratory diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
