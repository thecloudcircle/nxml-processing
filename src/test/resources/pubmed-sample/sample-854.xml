CCHFV is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. Basically, this disease is transmitted to humans by domestic animals and bite of an infected tick or via aerosol generated from infected animals&#x02019; excreta. Human to human transmission occurs following contact with an infected person&#x02019;s blood, tissue or fluid discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The vectors of this arthropod-borne disease are generally hard ticks of Ixodidae family, including some species of <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic>, <italic>Boophilus</italic>, <italic>Dermacentor</italic> and <italic>Hyalomma</italic> (in particular <italic>Hyalomma marginatum</italic>). Some species of <italic>Argas</italic>and <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> in Argasidae family have been reported to be infected The highly lethal virus is known for producing devastating outbreaks in humans which are very common in areas with developing healthcare systems such as in Africa, Middle East Asia, and Balkans. CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its prolonged and intense course of infection. It has epidemic potential, high case fatality ratio (10&#x02013;40%), and difficulties in treatment and prevention. The Hyalomma tick bite infection has a high rate of nosocomial transmission especially due to direct human to human contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Pakistan, sporadic outbreaks have been reported frequently, mostly due to contact with viremic livestock blood and nosocomial transmission. The hospital-borne spread has been associated with a lack of, or improper use of personal protective equipment when dealing with infected patients. It mostly occurs during early contact with an undiagnosed patient before taking appropriate protective measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The first case of CCHF in Pakistan was reported in 1976 and since then continuous cases of CCHF have been emerging throughout the country. In Pakistan 2010, outbreak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province precipitated and 100 cases were reported and had a 10% fatality rate. Similarly on 11 July 2014, in Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Kpk, 8 patients died, out of which 6 were Afghan nationals and a nurse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> Illustrates the prevalence of CCHF, from 2012 to 2016. In accordance with the ministry of the national institute of health, a total of 323 cases were confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Baluchistan remains the most affected province followed by KPK and Punjab. As Pakistan shares, a long border with Afghanistan so large number of patients from Afghanistan come to Pakistani hospitals especially in Peshawar, Quetta, and Islamabad making Congo infection of particular danger in these areas. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, shows that since the last 5&#x02009;years about 47% of cases were reported from Baluchistan followed by 17% from Punjab 15% from KPK. Whereas, 14% cases were reported from Sindh followed by 4% from Islamabad and 2% from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and lastly 1% from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Prevalence of CCHF in Pakistan.

Such climatic changes affect the initiation and spread of disease outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A similar trend of CCHF spread has been observed. During extremely hot weather the spread of CCHF experiences, a fall back followed by a subsequent rise during average weather. CCHF is an occupational disease for livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, health care workers, animal husbandry workers and veterinarians who belong to a group of people at high risk of the disease in the endemic areas of CCHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The incidence rate increases by many folds during Eid ul Adha, a religious festival during which millions of animals are slaughtered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As CCHF is a viral contagious endemic disease, cases of spread of this disease in healthcare professionals have also observed. In Quetta, a doctor died due to CCHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another doctor died of Congo fever in Abbottabad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A Surgeon and nurse from Bahawalpur hospital died of CCHF at Agha Khan University Hospital (AKUH) in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Healthcare professionals are a high-risk group and the primary custodians for the provision of health-related treatments. Although education campaigns have increased their awareness regarding CCHF yet it remains unclear to what extent this knowledge can be put into practice and to what extent this practice actually reduces CCHF infection spread. Knowledge, attitude, and perception survey provide a suitable format to evaluate existing programs and to identify effective strategies for behavior change in society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of future medical and pharmacy graduates. The main purpose of this study was to identify the knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of medical and pharmacy students about CCHF so a questionnaire assessing these aspects was designed and validated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par15">A cross-sectional study was carried out amongst students of medical and pharmacy government and private universities of Pakistan from August 2016 to January 2017.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study location</title><p id="Par16">The study was conducted in Islamabad (capital of Pakistan), Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Faisalabad.

In order to effectively deal with CCHF patients with minimum risks, healthcare professionals need to have good knowledge about precautionary measures like wearing of gloves, masks, protective clothing, goggles, disposables gowns and face shields before visiting patients. Transmission can occur through direct contact with infected blood, needle stick injuries, and contact with infected abraded skin and during disposal of infected waste. In Pakistan, a qualified general surgeon died of CCHF while dealing with CCHF patient due to nosocomial transmission. Many other examples of this type can be observed frequently throughout the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The previous such study conducted in students of a single college in Pakistan concluded that students have poor knowledge even about cause and source of transmission of CHF because respondents were nonhealthcare students like a business and social science students.

Knowledge about the causes of disease was good but major deficiency was observed in transmission, epidemiology, and treatment of disease. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, overall female healthcare students have more knowledge then male participants. The reason might be the hard work and more interest of female students in health care practices. Knowledge of healthcare students increased with age and married students are quite good in this as they might attend number of clinical rounds, conferences, and workshops. so they have more knowledge about the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Medical students knowledge was significantly better than that of pharmacist students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This could be possibly explained by the current health care system in Pakistan where medical students are seen as more clinically oriented professionals than other professionals because of their in-depth clinical training and more opportunities for professional development. However, it is equally important to educate Pharmacist, as they are at equal risk of acquiring and transmitting infections such as CCHF. There is a need to encourage these workers to educate themselves with an updated knowledge of infections and other healthcare issues by participating in educational and related programs.</p><p id="Par31">More than 70% healthcare professionals favored there should be an isolated room for the CCHF confirmed patients. These results are consistent with the studies previously done in healthcare professionals in Iran. These results were also consistent with the results of a study conducted in rural Georgian village [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, in one question highly negative attitude was observed like commenting on the statement &#x02018;is healthcare system of Pakistan is effectively equipped with the treatment facilities or not&#x02019; only about 34% participants agreed with the statement while the majority of participants opposed the statement with a negative attitude. This result is consistent with these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Findings of these results revealed that with huge positive attitude if healthcare professionals equip themselves with the basic knowledge of CCHF disease, better treatment of patients can be done with limited resources.</p><p id="Par32">Among the participants 59% agreed on to follow standard procedures to minimize the risk of infections,57% students agreed that they are effectively equipped with necessary observing skills, 57% participants agreed with the use of preventive medicine and 56% showed positive response about whether they have valuable sources of information. These results are somewhat similar to the studies conducted previously in different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Majority of participants agreed that animal herders and pets increased the risk of CCHF infection just like Turkish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The mean attitude and perceptions of the participants were positive. The attitudes and perceptions of the physician students were more positive than that of pharmacist students. This finding could be interpreted to mean that physician students are more aware of their patient&#x02019;s clinical condition and are responsible for counseling patients, which reflects positivity in their attitudes and perceptions about the disease.</p><p id="Par33">Although the national institute of Health (NIH), Pakistan has already advised that healthcare professionals are at increased risk of contracting the disease. Despite the welcoming and positive attitude and perceptions of students towards CCHF, knowledge of students about CCHF was very poor. Possible reasons include lack of educational programs necessarily dealing the outbreak of disease.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p id="Par34">The strength of this study is that it has focused on the area where not much literature is available from Pakistan. The results of this study can help the stakeholders and other health officials to evaluate the effectiveness of their policies about CCHF. The large sample size and the fact that a fairly high proportion of the total number of students from private (52.1%) and public (47.9%) colleges from the capital city and Punjab province are included to strengthen the validity of the research. However, since Pakistan is a country with huge regional differences in socioeconomic and health status, our results may not be representative of all medical and pharmacy students in the country. The reliability and validity of the survey are strengthened through the previous testing of the instrument. However, we cannot ignore the tendency of participants to provide more socially desirable responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">The current study has its implications in relation to policy and practice as it provides a current snapshot of the knowledge, attitude, and perception about a life-threatening zoonotic endemic among future health care professionals. The findings of this study indicate that the student HCWs&#x02019; knowledge about CCHF was not optimal; however, their attitudes about CCHF were positive. Future studies should be conducted nationwide to validate these results. Interventions should be customized to target areas where participants showed a lack of knowledge and negative attitudes. Study results demonstrate that it is crucial to evaluate current curriculum and there is dire need of awareness seminars, conferences, and workshops about current endemic diseases to future health care professionals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
