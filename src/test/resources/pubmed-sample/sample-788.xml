Introduction</title><p>San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXXT) is a popular Chinese medicine formula, containing Rhei Rhizoma (rhizomes of <italic>Rheum officinale</italic> BAILL; RR), Scutellariae Radix (roots of <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> Georgi; SR) and Coptidis Rhizoma (rhizomes of <italic>Coptis chinesis</italic> Franch; CR). Numerous studies have reported bioactivities of SHXXT including hypotension [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], gastric protection [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], antioxidant [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The chemical composition of SHXXT is very complex and the major constituents known are anthraquinones in RR including emodin, aloe-emodin, rhein, chrysophanol and their glycosides; flavonoids in SR including baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside, wogonin and alkaloids in CR including berberine, palmatine, coptisine (structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the information concerning biological fates of various constituents in SHXXT remains lacking, which prevents us from better understanding the rational of its clinical implication.</p><p>On the basis of recent findings on the metabolism of flavonoid polyphenols, it is increasingly recognized that polyphenol glycosides are subject to hydrolysis in gut lumen, absorbed as their aglycones and then extensively metabolized by conjugation reactions [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This study investigated the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of polyphenolic derivatives including anthraquinones, flavonoids and isoquinoline alkaloids after administration of SHXXT decoction to rats.</p><p>For more than two decades, the free radical-mediated peroxidation of membrane lipid and oxidative damage of DNA has long been thought to be associated with a variety of health problems, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. As an extension of our pharmacokinetic study, the serum metabolite of SHXXT in rats was prepared, characterized and the activity against 2,2&#x02032;-azobis(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH)-induced hemolysis was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The relative systemic exposure of each polyphenol with their conjugated metabolites was ranked as follows: rhein &#x0003e; baicalein &#x0003e; emodin &#x0003e; wogonin &#x0003e; aloe-emodin &#x0003e; chrysophanol. The residence times of the conjugated metabolites of various polyphenols were quite long except aloe-emodin.

Inhibition of Serum Metabolites of SHXXT on AAPH-Induced Hemolysis</title><p>The serum metabolites of SHXXT used for measuring antioxidant activity have been characterized and the result is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. During incubation with erythrocytes and AAPH for 5 hours, the effects of 1-, 1/2- and 1/8-fold of SHXXT blood concentrations against hemolysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The serum metabolites of SHXXT at 1- and 1/2-fold of blood level exhibited significant free radical scavenging effect, whereas 1/8-fold was ineffective. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Polyphenols are predominantly present in plants as glycosides. Because authentic compounds of polyphenol glycosides were mostly not available, hydrolysis of SHXXT was then performed in order to quantitate the total content of each polyphenol with correspondent glycosides. When hydrolysis was carried out in 1.2N HCl, serious charring was observed. Alternatively, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase was used for the hydrolysis and conducted at 37&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The analytical methods of SHXXT decoction and serum were developed in this study and validation of these methods indicated that the precision and accuracy were satisfactory.</p><p>Following oral administration of SHXXT, only rhein existed in part as free form, whereas the parent forms of berberine, palmatine, coptisine, baicalein, wogonin, aloe-emodin, emodin and chrysophanol were not found. The serum level of rhein, an anthraquinone carboxylic acid, was rather high, which can be accounted for by the low glucuronidation activity of UDP-glucuronyltransferases toward the class of carboxylic acids [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The absence of berberine, palmatine and coptisine in the blood can be explained by extensive first pass effect on account of that several metabolites of berberine have been detected in human urine and rat plasma after intake of berberine [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The major metabolites identified in human urine included jatrorrhizine-3-sulfate, thalifendine-2-sulfate, demethyleneberberine-10-sulfate and berberrubine [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In rat plasma, the free forms and glucuronides of thalifendine, demethyleneberberine and jatrorrhizine were identified [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These metabolites of berberine were formed through dealkylation or/and conjugation reaction occurring in gut and liver during the first pass. Being salt-like compounds, berberine, palmatine and coptisine are seemingly too hydrophilic to be absorbed through passive diffusion. Lately, the absorption of berberine was found mediated by organic cationic transporter [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In regard to baicalein, wogonin, aloe-emodin, emodin and chrysophanol, only their conjugated metabolites were found in serum, indicating that they were subject to extensive conjugation metabolism by intestine and liver during the first pass. Since the authentic compounds of the conjugated metabolites of various polyphenols were not available, their concentrations in serum were quantitated indirectly through hydrolysis with glucuronidase and sulfatase. The hydrolysis condition has been optimized in our preliminary study. The optimal durations needed for treatments with glucuronidase and sulfatase were both 4 hours in the presence of ascorbic acid and under anaerobic condition. The addition of ascorbic acid was to avoid the oxidative decay of polypenol aglycones during the enzymolysis reaction.</p><p>Due to considerable amount of glucuronidase in the sulfatase (type H-1) used in this study, treatment with this enzyme resulted in the hydrolysis of both sulfates and glucuronides. The results showed that the serum profiles of baicalein, wogonin, rhein, aloe-emodin, emodin and chrysophanol liberated by glucuronidase and sulfatase/glucuronidase were comparable, indicating that the glucuronides were the principal metabolites, whereas their sulfates were negligible. The mean residence times of the glucuronides of various polyphenols were rather long, indicating possible enterohepatic recycling of these metabolites. Because the biotransformations of flavonoids <italic>in vivo</italic> have been generally known, the biological fates of anthraquinone polyphenols in rats is proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> based on our results. 
</p><p>In the wake of getting the ratios of total AUC<sub>0&#x02212;<italic>t</italic></sub> (glucuronides/sulfates + free form) to dose (aglycones + glycosides) and compared among six polyphenols (data not shown), the relative bioavailability of polyphenols can be ranked as follows: rhein &#x0003e; emodin &#x0003e; baicalein, chrysophanol, wogonin &#x0003e; aloe-emodin. The fact that rhein shows profoundly higher bioavailability than other polyphenols can be in part accounted for by the underestimated dose, because rhein can be biotransformed from aloe-emodin [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and bianthrones such as sennosides A and B [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which had not been quantitated in this study. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, we did find that considerable amount of rhein emerged at once when sennosides A and B were incubated with feces of rats and rabbits (data not shown). On the other hand, aloe-emodin was found the least bioavailable, which can be explained by its poor solubility in various solvent and its <italic>in vivo</italic> conversion to rhein [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In the AAPH-induced hemolysis assay, our results suggested that the metabolite of SHXXT exhibited promising free radical scavenging activity compared to blank serum. The potential protection of erythrocyte membrane from free-radical attack provides an important pathophysiological basis for making use of SHXXT as a remedy for free-radical related diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and aging.</p><p>Despite voluminous <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity studies reporting various beneficial effects of polyphenols [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], our finding that virtual absence of the free forms of baicalein, wogonin, aloe-emodin, emodin and chrysophanol suggests that it is difficult to infer the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of these compounds from their <italic>in vitro</italic> activities. In fact, the principle metabolites <italic>in vivo</italic> were their glucuronides, which possess completely different physicochemical properties from their free forms. These metabolites should play more important role for <italic>in vivo</italic> activities than their parent forms. It is an important issue that biologists redirect their targets on the conjugated metabolites of polyphenols. Several recent studies actually found the sulfates/glucuronides of morin and quercetin showed more promising bioactivities than their free forms [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], pointing to the possibility that the conjugated metabolites of polyphenols were not necessarily inactive and might be the principal active forms.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In SHXXT, alkaloids including berberine, palmatine, coptisine and polyphenols except rhein were not absorbed <italic>per se</italic>. Glucuronides were the principal metabolites of polyphenols including baicalein, wogonin, rhein, aloe-emodin, emodin and chrysophanol. For better understanding the rational of the clinical implications of polyphenol-rich botanical products, it is strongly advised that biologists pay more attention to the bioactivity and toxicity of the metabolites of these polyphenols.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Funding</title><p>National Science Council, ROC (NSC95-2320-B-039-023-MY2, NSC 96-2320-B-039-037-MY3), the Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, ROC (CCMP96-RD-019, CCMP94-RD-019) and China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC (CMU95-087).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>C.- S.
