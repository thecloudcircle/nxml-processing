adult kidney disease that can begin in earliest childhood. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) in childhood differs from that in adults, in that the largest diagnostic group
among children includes congenital anomalies and inherited disorders, with
glomerulopathies and kidney disease as a consequence of diabetes being relatively
uncommon. In addition, many children with acute kidney injury will ultimately develop
sequelae that may lead to hypertension and CKD in later childhood or in adult life.
Children born early or who are small-for-date newborns have relatively increased risk
for the development of CKD later in life. Persons with a high-risk birth and early
childhood history should be watched closely in order to help detect early signs of
kidney disease in time to provide effective prevention or treatment. Successful
therapy is feasible for advanced CKD in childhood; there is evidence that children
fare better than adults, if they receive kidney replacement therapy including
dialysis and transplantation, although only a minority of children may require this
ultimate intervention. Because there are disparities in access to care, effort is
needed so that children with kidney disease, wherever they live, may be treated
effectively, irrespective of their geographic or economic circumstances. Our hope is
that the World Kidney Day will inform the general public, policy makers and
caregivers about the needs and possibilities surrounding kidney disease in
childhood.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>For in every adult there dwells the child that was, and in every child there

annual event, sponsored jointly by the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) and the
International Federation of Kidney Foundations (IFKF), has become a highly successful
effort to inform the general public and policy makers about the importance and
ramifications of kidney disease. In 2016, World Kidney Day will be dedicated to kidney
disease in childhood and the antecedents of adult kidney disease, which can begin in
earliest childhood.</p><p>Children who endure acute kidney injury (AKI) from a wide variety of conditions may have
long-term sequelae that can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) many years later (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr"/>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Further,
CKD in childhood, much of it congenital, and complications from the many non-renal
diseases that can affect the kidneys secondarily, not only lead to substantial morbidity
and mortality during childhood but also result in medical issues beyond childhood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Indeed, childhood deaths from a long list
of communicable diseases are inextricably linked to kidney involvement. For example,
children who succumb to cholera and other diarrheal infections often die not from the
infection but because of AKI induced by volume depletion and shock. In addition, a
substantial body of data indicates that hypertension, proteinuria and CKD in adulthood
have childhood antecedents - from as early as <italic>in utero</italic> and perinatal
life (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref> for definitions of childhood).
World Kidney Day 2016 aims to heighten general awareness that much of adult renal
disease is actually initiated in childhood. The understanding of high risk diagnoses and
events that occur in childhood have the potential to help professionals to identify and
intervene preemptively in people at higher risk for CKD during their lifetimes.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The types and risks of kidney disease change across the life cycle. The

</p><p>Worldwide epidemiological data on the spectrum of both CKD and AKI in children are
currently limited, though increasing in scope. The prevalence of CKD in childhood is
rare, and has been variously reported at 15-74.7 per million children (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Such variation is likely because data on CKD are
influenced by regional and cultural factors, as well as by the methodology used. The
World Health Organization (WHO) has recently added kidney and urologic disease to
mortality information tracked worldwide, which should be a valuable source of such data
over time, although yet WHO does not post the information by age group (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Databases such as the North American Pediatric
Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and the European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EDTA) registry
(<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) include data on pediatric end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), and on CKD. Projects such as the ItalKid (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) studies, the Global Burden of Disease Study
2013, as well as registries that now exist in many countries provide important
information, although more is required (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>AKI may lead to CKD, according to selected adult population studies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The incidence of AKI among children admitted to
an intensive care unit varies widely from 8 to 89% (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The outcome depends on the available resources. The results from projects
such as the AWARE study, a five-nation study of AKI in children, are awaited (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Single-center studies, as well as meta-analyses
indicate that both AKI and CKD in children account for a minority of CKD worldwide
(<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).
However, it is increasingly evident that kidney disease in adulthood often springs from
a childhood legacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Spectrum of pediatric kidney diseases</title><p>The conditions that account for CKD in childhood, with a predominance of congenital and
hereditary disorders, differ substantially from those in adults. To date, mutations in
more than 150 genes have been found to alter kidney development or specific glomerular
or tubular functions (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Most of these genetic
disorders present during childhood, and many lead to progressive CKD. Congenital
anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) account for the largest category of
CKD in children (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>) and include renal
hypoplasia/dysplasia and obstructive uropathy (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Important subgroups among renal dysplasias are the cystic kidney diseases,
which originate from genetic defects of the tubuloepithelial cells' primary cilia. Many
pediatric glomerulopathies are caused by genetic or acquired defects of the podocytes,
the unique cell type lining the glomerular capillaries. Less common but important causes
of childhood CKD are inherited metabolic disorders such as hyperoxaluria and cystinosis,
and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (a thrombotic microangiopathy related to genetic
abnormalities of the complement, coagulation or metabolic pathways) (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>
<table-wrap id="t02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="1414-431X-bjmbr-1414-431X20165314-gt002"/></table-wrap>
</p><p>In various classifications, there are no clear guidelines on how to categorize children
who have suffered AKI and apparently recovered, or how and whether to include children
who have had perinatal challenges, likely resulting in a relatively low nephron
number.</p><p>Among children with childhood-onset of ESRD, glomerulopathies are slightly more common
and congenital anomalies less common (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>),
due to the typically more rapid nephron loss in glomerular disease. However, recent
evidence suggests that many patients with milder forms of CAKUT may progress to ESRD
during adulthood, peaking in the fourth decade of life (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>There are national and regional differences in the types and course of both AKI and CKD
during childhood and beyond. Death from kidney disease is higher in developing nations
(<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and national and regional disparities in
care and outcome must be addressed. Further, access to care is variable, depending on
the region, the country, and its infrastructure. By focusing on kidney disease in
childhood, cost-effective solutions may be reached, as treating disease early and
preemptively may prevent later, more advanced CKD. Outcomes depend on the availability
of care and management. Treating children, even from infancy, who have AKI and CKD that
require renal replacement therapy (RRT) can be effective in mitigating the burden of
kidney disease in adulthood. Doing so requires resources that focus on the most
expeditious and cost-effective ways to deliver acute RRT in childhood.</p></sec><sec><title>Congenital kidney disease and the implications of perinatal programming</title><p>In regions where antenatal fetal ultrasounds are routine, many children with urologic
abnormalities are identified antenatally, which permits early intervention. However, in
much of the world, children with structural abnormalities are not identified until much
later, when symptoms develop. While generalized screening for proteinuria, hematuria and
urinary tract infections are carried out in some countries and regions, there is a lack
of consensus as to its effectiveness. However, there is a general agreement that
children with antenatal ultrasound examinations that indicate possible genitourinary
anomalies, children with a family history of kidney disease, and children with signs
such as failure to thrive or a history of urinary tract infection, voiding dysfunction
or an abnormal appearing urine should be examined (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Initial screening would include a focused physical examination and a
urine dipstick, formal urinalysis and a basic chemistry panel, followed by a more
specialized evaluation, if indicated.</p><p>Depending on the diagnosis, definitive therapy may be indicated. However, the evidence
that therapy will slow progression of CKD in childhood remains limited.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, antioxidants
and possibly dietary changes may be indicated, depending on the diagnosis. However,
dietary changes need to permit adequate growth and development. The ESCAPE trial
provided evidence that strict blood pressure control retards progression of CKD in
children, irrespective of the type of underlying kidney disease (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Some children may require RRT in early infancy. Recent data pooled from registries
worldwide indicate good survival, even when dialysis is required from neonatal age
(<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
Kidney transplantation, the preferred RRT for children, is generally suitable after 12
months of age, with excellent patient and allograft survival, growth, and
development.</p><p>Evidence is accumulating that childhood-onset CKD leads to accelerated cardiovascular
morbidity and shortened life expectancy (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).
Ongoing large prospective studies, such as the Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children
with CKD (4C) Study, are expected to inform about the causes and consequences of early
cardiovascular disease in children with CKD (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In addition to children with congenital kidney disease, it is now known that other
perinatal events may affect future health of children with absence of evident kidney
disease in early life (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Premature infants
appear to be particularly at risk for kidney disease long after they are born, based
both on observational cohort studies, as well as on case reports (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Increasingly
premature infants survive, including many born well before nephrogenesis is complete
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The limited data available indicate
that, during neonatal intensive care unit treatment, such babies receive many
nephrotoxins, and that those dying prior to discharge from the nursery have fewer and
larger glomeruli (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Additionally, those
surviving have evidence of renal impairment that may be subtle (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Even more concerning, abundant epidemiological data indicate
that persons born at term but with relatively low birth weights may be at high risk for
hypertension, albuminuria and CKD in later life (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). When specific measurements are pursued, such persons, as adults, may
have fewer nephrons, thus a low cardiorenal endowment.</p><p>In focusing on children for World Kidney Day, we would note that it is key to follow
kidney function and blood pressure throughout life in those persons born early or
small-for-dates. By doing so, and avoiding nephrotoxic medications throughout life, it
may be possible to avert CKD in many people.</p></sec><sec><title>Resources and therapeutics for children - differences from therapeutics in
adults</title><p>Disparities exist in the availability of resources to treat AKI in children and young
people. Consequently, too many children and young adults in developing nations succumb
if AKI occurs. To address the problem the International Society of Nephrology has
initiated the Saving Young Lives Project, which aims both to prevent AKI with prompt
treatment of infection and/or delivery of appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, and
to treat AKI when it occurs. This ongoing project in Sub-saharan Africa and South East
Asia, in which four kidney foundations participate equally (International Pediatric
Nephrology Association (IPNA), ISN, International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis
(ISPD), and Sustainable Kidney Care Foundation (SKCF)), focuses on establishing and
maintaining centers for the care of AKI, including the provision of acute peritoneal
dialysis. It links with the ISN's 0 by 25 project, which calls on members to ensure by
2025 that nobody dies from preventable and acute kidney injury.</p><p>In view of the preponderance of congenital and hereditary disorders, therapeutic
resources for children with CKD have historically been limited to a few immunological
conditions. Very recently, progress in drug development in concert with advances in
genetic knowledge and diagnostic capabilities has begun to overcome the long-standing
'therapeutic nihilism' in pediatric kidney disease. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome,
long considered ominous, with a high likelihood of progression to ESRD and
post-transplantation recurrence, has turned into a treatable condition with the advent
of a monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks C5 activation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Another example is the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists
to retard cyst growth and preserve kidney function in polycystic kidney disease (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). First proven efficacious in adults with
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, therapy with vaptans holds promise also
for the recessive form of the disease, which presents as, and often progresses to, ESRD
during childhood.</p><p>However, patient benefit from pharmacological research breakthroughs is jeopardized on a
global scale by the enormous cost of some of the new therapeutic agents. The quest for
affordable innovative therapies for rare diseases will be a key issue in pediatric
nephrology in the years to come.</p><p>The identification of children likely to benefit from novel therapeutic approaches will
be greatly facilitated by the development of clinical registries that inform about the
natural disease course, including genotype-phenotype correlations. Apart from
disease-specific databases, there is also a need for treatment-specific registries.
These are particularly relevant in areas where clinical trials are difficult to perform
due to small patient numbers and lack of industry interest. Treatment-specific
registries are also important for therapies in need of global development or
improvement. For instance, there is currently a large international gradient in the
penetration and performance of pediatric dialysis and transplantation. While pediatric
treatment and patient survival rates are excellent and even superior to those of adults
in many industrialized countries, it is estimated that chronic RRT is not offered at all
to almost half of the world's childhood population. Providing access to RRT for all
children will be a tremendous future challenge. To obtain reliable information on the
demographics and outcomes of pediatric RRT, the IPNA is about to launch a global
population-based registry. If successful, the IPNA RRT registry might become a role
model for global data collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Transition from pediatric to adult care</title><p>Transition of care for adolescents with kidney disease into an adult setting is critical
both for patients and their caregivers. Non-adherence is a too-frequent hallmark of
transition from pediatric to adult care for young patients with chronic disease states
(<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Hence,
considered steps combined with systematically defined procedures supported by validated
pathways and credible guidelines must be in place to ensure successful outcomes.</p><p>In the process of change from pediatric to adult care, &#x0201c;transition&#x0201d;, which should occur
gradually, must be distinguished from &#x0201c;transfer&#x0201d;, which is often an abrupt and
mechanistic change in provider setting. Introducing the concept of transition should be
preemptive, starting months or years prior to the targeted time, as children move into
adolescence and adulthood. The ultimate goal is to foster a strong relationship and
individualized plan in the new setting that allows the patient to feel comfortable
enough to report non-adherence and other lapses in care.</p><p>A transition plan must recognize that the emotional maturity of children with kidney
disease may differ widely. Assessment of the caregiver and the family structure as well
as cultural, social, and financial factors at the time of transition is the key,
including a realistic assessment of caregiver burden (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The appropriate timing and format of transition may vary widely among
different patients and in different settings; therefore, a flexible process without a
set date and even without a delineated format may be preferred.</p><p>Importantly, transition may need to be slowed, paused or even reversed temporarily
during crises such as disease flares or progression, or if family or societal
instability occurs. A recent joint consensus statement by the ISN and the IPNA proposed
steps consistent with the points just outlined, aiming to enhance the transition of care
in kidney disease in clinical practice (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Call for generating further information and action</title><p>Given vulnerabilities of children with kidney disease, including impact on growth and
development and future life as an adult, and given the much greater proportion of
children in developing nations facing resource constraints, educating everyone involved
is imperative in order to realign communications and actions (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). These efforts should
foster regional and international collaborations and exchange of ideas between local
kidney foundations, professional societies, other not-for-profit organizations, and
states and governments, so as to help empower all stakeholders to improve the health,
well-being and quality of life of children with kidney diseases and to ensure their
longevity into adulthood.</p><p>Until recently, however, the WHO consensus statement on non-communicable diseases (NCD)
included cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease, but
not kidney disease (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Fortunately, due in part to a global campaign led by the ISN,
the political declaration on NCDs from the United Nations Summit in 2011 mentioned
kidney disease under Item 19 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Increasing education and awareness about renal diseases in general and kidney disease in
childhood in particular is consistent with the objectives of the WHO to reduce mortality
from NCD within a 10-year target, with population level initiatives focusing on changes
in life style (including tobacco use reduction, salt intake control, dietary energy
control, and alcohol intake reduction) and effective interventions (including blood
pressure, cholesterol and glycemic control). Heightened efforts are needed to realign
and expand these multidisciplinary collaborations with more effective focus on early
detection and management of kidney disease in children. Whereas the issues related to
kidney disease may be overshadowed by other NCDs with apparently larger public health
implications such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, our efforts should
also increase education and awareness on such overlapping conditions as cardiorenal
connections, the global nature of the CKD and ESRD as major NCDs, and the role of kidney
disease as the multiplier disease and confounder for other NCDs. White papers including
consensus articles and blueprint reviews by world-class experts can serve to enhance
these goals (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute kidney injury in children and its potential consequences in
