Internal ribosome entry sites have been recognized in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region of some mRNA species of HIV-1, which would contribute to an alternative mechanism of initiation of mRNA translation. However, the Cap-dependent translation is assumed to be the main mechanism driving the initiation of HIV-1 protein synthesis. In this work, we describe a cell system in which lower to higher levels of transient expression of the poliovirus 2A protease strongly inhibited cellular Cap-dependent translation with no toxic effect to the cells during a 72-hour time frame. In this system, the synthesis of HIV-1 proteins was inhibited in a temporal dose-dependent way. Higher levels of 2A protease expression severely inhibited HIV-1 protein synthesis during the first 24 hours of infection consequently inhibiting viral production and infectivity. Intermediate to lower levels of 2A Protease expression caused the inhibition of viral protein synthesis only during the first 48 hours of viral replication. After this period both protein synthesis and viral release were recovered to the control levels. However, the infectivity of viral progeny was still partially inhibited. These results indicate that two mechanisms of mRNA translation initiation contribute to the synthesis of HIV-1 proteins; during the first 24&#x02013;48 hours of viral replication HIV-1 protein synthesis is strongly dependent on Cap-initiation, while at later time points IRES-driven translation initiation is sufficient to produce high amounts of viral particles.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported with grants from CNPq, CAPES and FAPERJ.

IRES-dependent translation occurs for certain mammalian mRNAs under certain metabolic conditions <xref rid="pone.0088619-Johannes1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Viruses must use the cellular machinery to synthesize their own proteins, as this process is highly complex and involves several components that are not encoded by the viral genomes. Moreover, especially for highly cytolytic RNA viruses, viral and host mRNAs compete for the translation machinery components. Thus, animal viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to maximize the selective translation of their own mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0088619-Reineke1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For instance, as initiation of mRNA translation is critical to ensure the synthesis of all eukaryotic proteins, and consequently is a tightly regulated step, in order to ensure synthesis of their own proteins, viruses frequently target this step <xref rid="pone.0088619-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The canonical translation initiation requires the recognition and binding of the mRNA through the 5&#x02032; CAP and the 3&#x02032; poly-A structures by the heterotrimeric protein complex eIF4F, which is composed of eIF4E, a protein factor that binds directly to the 5&#x02032; methyl Cap and also to eIF4A, which has RNA helicase activity. This last protein is bound by the scaffolding protein eIF4G, which by its turn further binds to the Poly-A Binding Protein (PABP), which binds the 3&#x02032; poly-A structure and approximates it to the 5&#x02032; methyl Cap. The formation of the above complex is required for the recognition and binding of the mRNA by the 43S complex, which brings both the 40S subunit of the ribosomal RNA and the tRNA-Met initiator <xref rid="pone.0088619-Sonenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Several viral proteins are synthesized by a non-canonical strategy of translation initiation, driven by the presence of an IRES element in a number of mRNAs. There are different types of IRES, but all contain a rich secondary structure with several stem&#x02013;loops, which are responsible for this alternative ribosome recruiting pathway which does not require most of the eIFs <xref rid="pone.0088619-Jang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. To ensure that the translational machinery stays available only to viral mRNAs, some viruses encode proteases that cleave initiation factors, as eIF4G and PABP <xref rid="pone.0088619-KuyumcuMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Under these conditions, cap-dependent and, therefore, synthesis of most cellular protein is strongly impaired, but there is no interference in IRES-driven translation <xref rid="pone.0088619-Gradi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. One of the best-characterized viral strategies is the one promoted by members of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family such as Poliovirus <xref rid="pone.0088619-Chase1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The Poliovirus genome encodes proteases that have crucial roles in the shutoff of the cellular protein synthesis. One of these proteases is named 2A protease (2APro). This small cysteine-protease cleaves the initiation factor eIF4G, which acts as a scaffold protein bridging the 5&#x02032; Cap to the 40S ribosomal subunit through eIF4E and eIF3, respectively <xref rid="pone.0088619-Gingras1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Hence, cleavage of eIF4G by 2Apro separates the two halves of the protein and leads to an impaired Cap-dependent translation, allowing Poliovirus to turn cellular machinery to synthesize its own proteins <xref rid="pone.0088619-Aldabe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, retroviruses such as HIV-1 perform retrotranscription and integration into a cellular genome. Once integrated, the provirus functions like any eukaryotic gene, and uses cellular factors to start its protein synthesis, which is done mainly by the Cap structure of its mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0088619-SotoRifo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088619-Berkhout1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, there is still some controversy whether translation of retroviral mRNAs is strictly Cap-dependent, since some studies have demonstrated the existence of IRES elements on the 5&#x02032;UTR of HIV-1, FIV and SIV <xref rid="pone.0088619-Ohlmann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088619-Camerini1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In the present work, we analyzed the effect of the expression of 2APro on HIV-1 replication, investigating the importance of cap and IRES-driven translation for virus production and infectivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plasmid Constructions</title><p>The pCMV-2APro e pCMV-UTR-2APro expression vectors (named p2A and pU2A, respectively), were obtained by the PCR-amplification and cloning of the 5&#x02032;UTR region and the 2APro gene from the Poliovirus vaccine strain Sabin-1.

Hut78 cells were transfected with pNL4-3 (lanes 3 and 5), or co-transfected with pNL4-3 and pU2A at proportion 1&#x02236;3 (lanes 2 and 4), or mock-transfected (lanes 1 and 6) and incubated for 48 (lanes 1&#x02013;3) or 72 hours (lanes 4&#x02013;6). After this time, cell lysates were processed by SDS-PAGE followed by western-blotting with an anti-eIF4G-I antibody. p values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant and are marked with an asterisk.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0088619.g008"/></fig><p>Interestingly, viral infectivity was partially inhibited for all proportions of 2APro used up to 48 hours from infection. Even when virus production was recovered at 72 hours of infection, infectivity was still inhibited for the 1&#x02236;1 proportion.

The levels of 2APro transcripts were similar in all conditions (data not shown).

While Cap-dependent synthesis seems to be highly required during the first 48 hours of HIV-1 replication, the IRES-driven protein translation initiation plays an important role later on the HIV-1 replication cycle. Moreover, the global inhibition of Cap-translation initiation, even without inhibiting the synthesis of viral proteins, imposes a detrimental effect on virus release and infectivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cells infected with poliovirus present a rapid shutoff of protein synthesis, while viral mRNA translation takes place normally <xref rid="pone.0088619-Leibowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This phenomenon is associated with the cleavage of eIF4G, a component of the eIF4F complex, that leads to a severe impairment of Cap-dependent translation <xref rid="pone.0088619-Etchison1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In this work, we transfected HeLa with a new 2APro expression vector, named pU2A, in order to induce an unfavorable state of Cap-dependent translation in these cells. In this condition, it is expected that IRES-driven translation occurs preferentially <xref rid="pone.0088619-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In cells transfected with pU2A we observed a strong shutoff in <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis until 72 hours after transfection, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, a non- to mild decrease in cellular viability was observed in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that cells remained metabolically viable during the time frame of the experiments. It had been demonstrated that cell lines expressing 2APro suffer drastic morphological changes and die 24 hours after expression of this protease <xref rid="pone.0088619-Barco1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and that cell death was related to the induction of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0088619-Calandria1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In our system neither drastic morphological changes nor cell death, measured indirectly by the XTT and neutral red assays, were observed during the 72 hours of 2APro expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Low levels of expression of 2APro would explain this difference, since we could not detect 2APro by Western-blotting when any of our plasmid constructions (p2A or pU2A) was used in cell transfections. However, the presence of 2APro transcripts within the cell cytoplasm was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), as well as the cleavage of eIF4G-I in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). These data indicate that 2APro was being expressed in these cells and was functioning as expected in inhibiting the cellular protein synthesis.</p><p>The transfection of high amounts of 2APro mRNAs from in vitro transcribed pU2A and p2A vectors allowed us to detect the Flag-Tagged 2APro. Indeed, the levels of 2APro translated from the UTR-2APro mRNA were lower than those of 2APro mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), confirming that the presence of a 5&#x02032;-UTR region upstream of a capped mRNA has negative effects upon the expression of proteins. However, this phenomenon alone could not explain the undetectable levels of this protease upon DNA transfection, since another plasmid encoding 2APro without the Poliovirus 5&#x02032;-UTR also gave rise to undetectable protein levels while inhibiting Cap-dependent protein synthesis (data not shown).</p><p>The fact that protein levels of 2APro were undetectable even when high levels of 2APro transcripts were detected in the cytoplasm of pU2A-transfected cells, while detection of this protein was only possible by mRNA transfection may suggest a differential control of mRNA translation related to the presence of Cap and/or the subcellular localization of the transcripts. It has already been demonstrated that mRNA localization after transport from the nucleus influences the rate of translation and the stability of the mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0088619-Marion1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, HeLa cells transfected with pU2A also presented expressive cleavage of eIF4G-I, up to 72 hours post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, cleavage of eIF4G-I is enhanced when cells were transfected with high amounts of pU2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also observed a strong reduction in Cap-dependent translation from two different vectors encoding distinct reporter genes; Luciferase and GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g004">Figures 4A and 4B</xref>). Therefore, despite the low levels of 2APro achieved in our transfection system, they were sufficient to inhibit Cap-dependent protein synthesis in HeLa cells.</p><p>Viral protein synthesis and consequently the production of viral particles upon 2APro expression in HeLa cells were strongly reduced. However, this effect was more drastic at higher concentrations of 2APro, in which viral replication was almost completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, under conditions in which less 2APro was expressed, we observed an recovery of viral production at 72 hours of co-transfection, when compared to the HIV-1 infection in the absence of 2APro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, in this condition, viral protein synthesis, virion release and infectivity were re-established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). When equal amounts of 2APro and the NL4-3 infectious clone were transfected, the synthesis of viral polyprotein precursors within the co-transfected cells yielded amounts equivalent to the NL4-3 infectious clone expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). However, both viral progeny release and infectivity were still inhibited.</p><p>Several groups recently have demonstrated that the 5&#x02032;-UTR of all mRNA species of HIV-1 harbors an IRES-like element <xref rid="pone.0088619-Brasey1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Buck1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Plank1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Moreover, these IRES elements are functional in cell-free systems <xref rid="pone.0088619-Ricci1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Vallejos1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The results of this study indicate the importance of both Cap-dependent and IRES-driven translation initiation of HIV-1 mRNAs. However, there is a time frame for its usage; for the first 48 hours of infection translation initiation of viral mRNAs is dependent on the recognition of the Cap structure. Therefore, the cleavage of eIF4G imposes a detrimental effect on viral protein synthesis. The Cap-dependence of viral mRNAS could be explained by the unavailability of host factors important for IRES recognition during the first 48 hours of expression of both 2APro and HIV-1 proteins. Nonetheless, a mechanism will exist to induce translation initiation via IRES latter on HIV-1 infection. The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr has been implicated in the arrest of infected cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0088619-Jowett1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The G2 arrest is characterized by the dephosphorylation of eIF4E that prevents the formation of the eIF4F complex. It is reasonable to assume that Cap-dependent translation initiation of viral mRNAs becomes unfavorable and translation initiation will occur preferentially via IRES elements <xref rid="pone.0088619-Brasey1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, these works used bicistronic vectors to analyze the function of viral IRES <xref rid="pone.0088619-Brasey1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Vallejos2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, so its functionality in the context of a viral infection it is not yet known. Nonetheless, the synthesis of HIV-1 proteins, as measured by the expression of the products of two different species of viral mRNAs (Env and Gag), was completely inhibited at 48 hours of co-transfection at the 1&#x02236;1 ratio. In this scenario, the expression of Vpr is equally unexpected.</p><p>Since the <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis in infected cells expressing different amounts of 2APro was inhibited from 72 hours post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g006">Figure 6</xref>), the recovery of viral protein synthesis at this time point for the 1&#x02236;1 and 3&#x02236;1 ratios of HIV-1 to 2APro could only be explained by the usage of the IRES element for translation initiation.</p><p>A possible effect of 2APro in the recovery of HIV-1 viral protein synthesis and production of infectious particles could be associated with polysome stability. 2APro increases the stability, translation, and replication of poliovirus mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0088619-Jurgens1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, by enhancing the stability of viral mRNAs and their association with polysomes <xref rid="pone.0088619-Kempf1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We observed a different profile of association of full-length HIV-1 mRNAs with monosomes or polysomes in the presence or absence of 2APro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g007">Figure 7</xref>, compare C and D). While at 72 hours post-transfection, HIV-1 mRNAs are normally associated with monosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), in cells that were co-transfected with 2APro, we observed an increase in association with polysomes at 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). This hypothesis needs to be further confirmed.</p><p>It has already been demonstrated that 2APro preferentially cleaves eIF4G-I, while the eIF4G-II isoform is more resistant to cleavage from this protease. Both eIF4G isoforms are necessary for mRNA translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. In addition, the rate-limiting step in the shutoff of host-cell translation is eIF4G-II cleavage <xref rid="pone.0088619-Gradi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Castello1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Svitkin1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. eIF4G-I is more abundant in HeLa cells <xref rid="pone.0088619-Marissen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>,therefore, in our system, expression of low concentrations of 2APro might lead preferentially to cleavage of eIF4G-I. Since eIF4G-I has been implicated in the pioneer round of translation initiation <xref rid="pone.0088619-Lejeune1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, its cleavage would affect global cell-host protein synthesis and consequently the expression of cellular factors necessary for the IRES-driven translation of viral mRNAS. Viral protein synthesis is resumed later, possibly due to the accumulation of host factors necessary to IRES recognition.</p><p>It is important to point out that the resumption of viral protein synthesis will not necessarily lead to the production of viral particles, as seen for the 1&#x02236;1 ratio of HIV-1 to 2APro in HeLa cells at 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In this specific case we can hypothesize that cellular factors required for successful assembly and/or release of viral progeny are not available.</p><p>Using a lymphocytic cell line as a system that is more similar to natural HIV-1 infection, this trend became even more accentuated. Complete viral replication inhibition was only reached at the highest 2APro concentrations. In contrast, when we used 2APro quantities equal to or smaller than HIV-1, viral production was similar to those encountered in the control. This probably indicates that host factors important to IRES-driven translation initiation are present early in this cell line. It is important to point out that, in this cell system, although high amounts of viral particles were produced in the presence of 2APro, they were less infectious than the NL4-3 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088619-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This observation suggests that several host-cell factors, which are fundamental for modifying the cellular environment and/or the viral progeny to make it infectious are not expressed under unfavorable Cap-translation conditions. Possibly, not all HIV-1 transcripts will harbor functional IRES elements. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that viral accessory proteins, such as Vif, Vpu and Nef, which contribute to HIV-1 infectivity, are not expressed.</p><p>The diverse mechanisms used by animal viruses to replicate their genomes and to translate viral mRNAs are crucial to a successful viral replication. As translation initiation is a strongly regulated step of eukaryotic protein synthesis, it is expected that viruses present strategies to subvert this machinery to benefit their own protein synthesis.</p><p>HIV-1 is strongly dependent on cellular factors for its replication <xref rid="pone.0088619-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, controversy remains as to which is the prevalent pathway for its mRNAs translation: Cap or IRES-dependent. Several recent studies have proposed that translation initiation via IRES could be important to HIV-1 replication, since there are IRES-like structures located at the LTR and downstream from the gag initiation code <xref rid="pone.0088619-Buck1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Ricci1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Chamond1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-deBreyne1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.It is possible that activation of HIV-1 IRES occurs simultaneously with G2/M cell cycle arrest, as this phase has optimal conditions to favor translation initiation driven by IRES. It has already been observed that Vpr protein or treatment with chemicals that induce G2/M arrest leads to an enhanced translation of HIV-1 mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0088619-Goh1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088619-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This alternative pathway of viral mRNA translation may be important to sustain HIV-1protein synthesis even in situations of global cellular translation impairment.</p><p>While this manuscript was under review, a paper came out demonstrating that both Cap-dependent and IRES-dependent translation initiation occurs at the full-length HIV-1 RNA <xref rid="pone.0088619-Monette1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The authors showed that either upon expression of the L-protease from FMDV or infection of HIV-1 expressing cells with Poliovirus, the 5&#x02032;-UTR from the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA was active in translation initiation. These results corroborate our findings; in our study, however, we were able to demonstrate the impact of Cap-dependent inhibition not only on HIV-1 protein synthesis but also on the formation of viral infectious progeny.</p><p>Together, our data strongly suggests that HIV-1 can use both Cap and IRES translation initiation to replicate, as even in cells in which Cap-driven translation is inhibited, HIV-1 proteins and virions are detected. As already suggested in other works <xref rid="pone.0088619-Ricci1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088619-Gendron1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, at different times of replication, HIV-1 could adopt different translation strategies, with one of the paths being preferential. Importantly, this study demonstrates that although HIV-1 could use the IRES-driven translation mechanism, it still depends on the expression of several host factors that are Cap-dependent.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Luciana Barros de Arruda for helpful discussions and suggestions and Mrs. Jo&#x000e3;o Baltazar and Mrs. Sidney Gomes da Costa for technical support.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0088619-Johannes1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
