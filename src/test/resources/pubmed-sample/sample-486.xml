JG-TB8 with U(VI) were studied under oxic and anoxic conditions in order to assess the influence of the oxygen-dependent cell metabolism on microbial uranium mobilization and immobilization. We demonstrated that aerobically and anaerobically grown cells of <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. JG-TB8 accumulate uranium from aqueous solutions under acidic conditions (pH 2 to 6), under oxic and anoxic conditions. A combination of spectroscopic and microscopic methods revealed that the speciation of U(VI) associated with the cells of the strain depend on the pH as well as on the aeration conditions. At pH 2 and pH 3, uranium was exclusively bound by organic phosphate groups provided by cellular components, independently on the aeration conditions. At higher pH values, a part (pH 4.5) or the total amount (pH 6) of the dissolved uranium was precipitated under oxic conditions in a meta-autunite-like uranyl phosphate mineral phase without supplying an additional organic phosphate substrate. In contrast to that, under anoxic conditions no mineral formation was observed at pH 4.5 and pH 6, which was clearly assigned to decreased orthophosphate release by the cells. This in turn was caused by a suppression of the indigenous phosphatase activity of the strain. The results demonstrate that changes in the metabolism of facultative anaerobic microorganisms caused by the presence or absence of oxygen can decisively influence U(VI) biomineralization.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially funded by the grants CGL2009-09760 and CGL2012-36505 (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n, Spain).

One of the big challenges of the third millennium is the management of radioactive waste and the protection of humans and the environment from its chemical and radiological toxicity <xref rid="pone.0102447-Ahearne1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The remediation procedures of uranium-polluted sites and waste piles in most cases only include a covering of the surface to prevent from direct radiation as well as from the release of radon gas or radioactive dusts. However, many rehabilitated sites are not sealed at the bottom, allowing a release of uranium from these tailings into the ground water by erosion and leaching processes. The negative effects of uranium on the structure and functions of ecosystems strongly depend on its mobility and bioavailability, which are in turn determined by its speciation and physicochemical form <xref rid="pone.0102447-Markich1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In nature uranium primarily occurs in the oxidation states +4 (UO<sub>2</sub>) and +6 (UO<sub>2</sub>
<sup>2+</sup>). In particular the uranyl ion (UO<sub>2</sub>
<sup>2+</sup>), which predominates under acidic (&#x0003c;pH 5) and non-reducing conditions <xref rid="pone.0102447-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, has a high mobility and biological toxicity, which is based on both, its chemical and radiological properties. The speciation and therefore the mobility of uranium in nature is affected by a variety of abiotic <xref rid="pone.0102447-Baik1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Barnett1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and biotic <xref rid="pone.0102447-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Renshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> factors. An important influence on the fate of uranium is exerted by microorganisms, which are present in large numbers and a great variety in nature. The multifaceted metabolism and structural components of these organisms provide various interaction mechanisms with radionuclides and other heavy metals <xref rid="pone.0102447-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102447-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. By now several studies have demonstrated that U(VI) is complexed by the negatively charged functional groups of the cell surface in a process called biosorption <xref rid="pone.0102447-Gadd1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Sar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For this reason, uranium is supposed to bind, at least to some extent, to all microbial cells. In addition, further microbial U(VI) transformations which alter the mobility of this radionuclide were demonstrated for particular microbial genera and individual strains. One of these processes is the U(VI) bioreduction, i.e. the formation of low soluble and therefore less toxic U(IV) species <xref rid="pone.0102447-Lovley1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Wall1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, the predominantly formed uraninite is not very stable in nature and can be easily re-oxidized. Another U(VI) immobilization process, which possesses a high potential for bioremediation of contaminated sites <xref rid="pone.0102447-Beazley1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, is the U(VI) biomineralization. It includes the precipitation of insoluble mineral phases, formed due to the release of microbially-generated inorganic ligands <xref rid="pone.0102447-Beazley2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Merroun2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A well-studied mechanism of uranium biomineralization is based on the activity of phosphatases <xref rid="pone.0102447-Beazley1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102447-Beazley3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Macaskie2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These microbial enzymes are expressed by a large variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria <xref rid="pone.0102447-Dassa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Satta1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and release inorganic orthophosphate from organic phosphate compounds. The released orthophosphate interacts with uranium and causes the precipitation of inorganic uranyl phosphate phases. As these precipitates are stable and poorly soluble in a wide range of pH, the formation of uranyl phosphate minerals can strongly decrease the mobility of uranium in nature.</p><p>Many of the before cited studies on U(VI)/microbe interactions revealed that underlying mechanisms strongly depend on abiotic parameters, such as pH, the ionic strength and the concentration of uranium. However, there is a lack of knowledge in the influence of another parameter, namely the oxygen tension, on U(VI)/microbe interactions. Even though it is well known that the presence or absence of oxygen has a strong influence on the cell metabolism and the uranium speciation itself, studies on the of U(VI)/microbe interactions in dependency on the oxygen tension are rare. The oxygen tension can, even quickly, change in soils and waters. In particular the upper soil layers continually experience cyclic changes in their oxygen tension due to changes in their moisture regime caused by rainfall events. Facultative anaerobic microorganisms are well adapted to such changes by switching their metabolism according to the presence or absence of oxygen. In this study we used the facultative anaerobic bacterium JG-TB8, which was recovered from a soil sample of the uranium mining waste pile &#x0201c;Haberland&#x0201d; (Johanngeorgenstadt, Saxony, Germany).</p><p>The main objective of the present study was to investigate the interactions of the facultative anaerobic isolate JG-TB8 with U(VI) under oxic and anoxic conditions, in order to determine the influence of the different cell metabolism on the uranium immobilization by this strain. Moreover, we studied the pH-dependency of the U(VI)/bacteria interactions under both aeration conditions. The aim was to determine the incidence of uranium biosorption, biomineralization, and bioreduction in dependency on the pH and the cell metabolism, which is in turn determined by the aeration conditions. The study contributes to a better understanding of the uranium mobility in contaminated ecosystems, which is needed to allow proper and reliable modelling for disposition of nuclear waste over many thousands of years as well as to develop new and to improve established bioremediation strategies for contaminated sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation, phylogenetic affiliation and cultivation</title><p>
<italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. JG-TB8 was isolated from an anaerobic microbial consortium enriched in liquid ATCC medium 591 <xref rid="pone.0102447-Atlas1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> at pH 4.5. The microbial consortium was recovered from a soil sample of the uranium mining waste pile &#x0201c;Haberland&#x0201d; in Saxony, Germany having an acidic pH of 4.5 <xref rid="pone.0102447-Geissler1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. From this consortium facultative anaerobic strains were isolated by spreading the diluted consortium on Nutrient Broth Agar (Mast Group Ldt., Merseyside, UK). After incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for five days, single colonies were isolated, maintained in the same medium and long-term stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C in 50% glycerol. JG-TB8 was phylogenetically affiliated with <italic>Paenibacillus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0102447-Ash1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> on the basis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence obtained by using the primers pair 16S<sub>7-27F</sub> and 16S<sub>1492-1513R</sub>.

For biomass production the strain was grown aerobically in 10 g/L Nutrient Broth medium using a 5L bioreactor (Pilot System, Applikon Biotechnology Inc., Foster City, USA) equipped with a bio-controller (Model ADI 1010), a control unit (ADI 1075) with three pneumatic pumps (acid, base, and antifoam), a stirrer controller, and rota meters. Anaerobic growth of JG-TB8 was carried out in airtight closed two litre bottles in ATCC medium 591 <xref rid="pone.0102447-Atlas1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In both cases, the cultivation temperature was 30&#x000b0;C and the pH was 7.2 as these parameters allowed rapid aerobic as well as anaerobic growth. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm and cell morphology was examined by phase-contrast light microscopy using Olympus BX-61 (Olympus Optical Co.

Subsequently, the cells were suspended in 0.1M NaClO<sub>4</sub>; the pH of the cell suspensions was checked and if necessary adjusted to the desired values. U(VI) bioaccumulation studies were performed at room temperature using a biomass concentration of 0.5 g dry biomass (which was determined by weighing parallel samples after drying for 48 hours at 70&#x000b0;C) per litre. The microbial cells were incubated in triplicate on a rotary shaker with a 5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> M uranyl nitrate, dissolved in 0.1 M NaClO<sub>4</sub> (pH 2, 3 or 4.5). At pH 6 the uranium concentration was reduced to 5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M in order to prevent the formation of uranyl hydroxide precipitates. The uranium accumulation by the cells was determined in dependency on the incubation time and the pH of the solution. An incubation time of one hour was chosen for determining the U(VI) binding capacity bound by the cells exclusively <italic>via</italic> metabolism-independent biosorption. In order to assess further interaction mechanisms we additionally determined the U(VI) accumulation by the cells after incubation for 48 hours. For quantification of the uranium binding the bacterial cells were removed from the solution by centrifugation and the unbound U(VI) in the supernatant was measured by inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectroscopy using an Elan 9000 system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The amount of removed uranium from the solution was normalized to the dry biomass.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Time-Resolved Laser-induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (TRLFS)</title><p>For TRLFS measurements portions (50 mg) of fresh grown cells were harvested, washed and treated with U(VI) for 48 hours at pH 2, 3, 4.5 or 6 under oxic conditions if grown aerobically, and under anoxic conditions if grown anaerobically, respectively. After the contact with U(VI) the cells were washed twice with 0.1 M NaClO<sub>4</sub> solutions with the corresponding pH and under corresponding atmospheric conditions to remove unbound uranium. The samples were air-dried (anoxic samples under nitrogen atmosphere) for 48 h and subsequently ground. In order to determine the luminescence properties of the uranium complexes formed by the cells of JG-TB8, small portions of the dried and powdered samples were put into quartz micro cuvettes. Each of the anoxic samples was transferred immediately before the TRLFS measurement under nitrogen atmosphere into a quartz micro cuvette, which was subsequently closed airtight. Uranium luminescence was excited at 410 nm using a pulsed Nd-YAG laser (GCR 190, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) <xref rid="pone.0102447-Reitz1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The central wavelength of the spectrograph and the gate time of the ICCD camera were set to 520 nm and 50 &#x000b5;s, respectively. TRLF spectra were recorded between 444 and 594 nm with a resolution of 0.3 nm. Calibration of the spectrograph and background correction was performed (for details see <xref rid="pone.0102447-Reitz2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>).</p><p>After U(VI) excitation, 101 U(VI) luminescence spectra (each calculated by averaging three single measurements) were recorded after defined delay times.

Delay time's step sizes were 200 ns and 1% of the time at which the complete U(VI) luminescence had faded away to determine uranium species exhibiting short and long luminescence lifetimes in the samples, respectively. The luminescence emission spectra were deconvoluted with the PeakFit module 4.0 of the software package Origin 8.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). Gaussian functions were used to describe the individual peaks and the parameters which were varied during the fitting procedure were peak wavelength, peak height and full width at half maximum.

The binding capacities obtained at pH 6 were not suitable for comparison, as the U(VI) accumulation was limited to about 24 mg uranium per g of dry biomass, due to the ten times lower U(VI) concentration in this sample. Apart from the samples incubated at pH 6, the U(VI) accumulation of the cells grown anaerobically and incubated under anoxic conditions was 25 to 35% lower compared to the U(VI) accumulation of cells grown aerobically and incubated under oxic conditions. After incubation for 48 h the U(VI) accumulation by the strain did not increase significantly at pH 2 and 3 under oxic conditions as well as under anoxic conditions. In contrast to that, at pH 4.5 under oxic conditions the amount of U(VI) associated with the cells approximately doubled. During the incubation the pH of the cell suspensions was checked.

In the spectra of the anoxic sample (pH 4.5 and 6) an additional luminescence peak at around 468 nm occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and, moreover, an additional U(VI) luminescence lifetime was calculated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t003">Table 3</xref>). This weak luminescence peak was related to U(VI) complexes formed at carboxylic groups of organic compounds (compare the reference samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t002">Table 2</xref>). The observed luminescence lifetime of these uranyl carboxylate complexes (&#x003c4;<sub>6</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7.82&#x000b1;1.25 &#x000b5;s) is similar to those of the uranyl carboxylate complexes recently published by Barkleit <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0102447-Barkleit2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and Vogel <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0102447-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to that, no corresponding peak was observed in the spectrum of the oxic samples (pH 4.5 and pH 6). Instead, the luminescence spectra were shifted to higher wavelengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). At pH 6 the main emission bands were located at 502.5, 523.1, and 545.2 nm. In this sample the mono-exponential luminescence decay indicated the presence of only one predominant luminescent U(VI) species with a lifetime of &#x003c4;<sub>5</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.05&#x000b1;0.24 &#x000b5;s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t003">Table 3</xref>). Similar luminescence properties have been described for different natural and synthesized uranyl phosphate minerals such as saleeite or meta-autunite <xref rid="pone.0102447-Geipel1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. At pH 4.5 the emission peaks were poorly resolved and only slightly red-shifted in comparison to the acidic samples. This was most likely caused by the formation of inorganic and organic uranyl phosphate complexes under these conditions. However, due to the similar luminescence lifetimes of the U(VI) complexes formed with organic and inorganic phosphates (compare &#x003c4;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>5</sub> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t003">Table 3</xref>) the emission bands of these two species could not be separated from each other. The presence of the third, very long-living U(VI) species (&#x003c4;<sub>3</sub>) was obviously not responsible for the observed differences in the shape of the spectrum as analyses of spectra recorded after longer delay times demonstrated emission bands highly comparable to those of the complexes formed at pH 2 and pH 3.</p><p>Whereas under anoxic conditions the luminescence properties of the sample incubated at pH 6 were very similar to those of the sample incubated at pH 4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t002">Table 2</xref>), the U(VI) luminescence spectrum recorded from the sample incubated at pH 6 under oxic conditions was further shifted to higher wavelengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>XAS analyses</title><p>In order to obtain information regarding the structure of the formed uranium complexes at molecular scale, XAS measurements were performed. The XANES region of the recorded spectra, located around the absorption edge, was used to check whether a reduction of the added U(VI) to U(IV) occurred. Our results clearly demonstrate that in all samples the bound uranium remained in the oxidation state +6, i.e. it was not reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The presence of U(VI) was clearly confirmed due to the following observations: The absorption edges of all spectra occurred at a photon energy which is typical for U(VI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, dashed line) and all spectra featured the multiple scattering contribution of the two axial oxygen atoms of U(VI), represented by a XANES peak around 17188 eV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, dotted line). U(VI) reduction was also not observed in parallel samples incubated at a favourable for this strain pH value of 7.2, which supports the finding that the investigated bacterial isolate <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp.

The structural data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t004">Table 4</xref>. In agreement with the TRLFS studies, the spectra recorded from the four samples incubated at pH 2 and pH 3 correspond to each other and show a high similarity to that of uranyl-fructose(6)phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). All fits included a shell of two axial oxygen atoms at a radial distance of 1.76 to 1.79 &#x000c5;, represented by the most prominent FT peak at around R+&#x00394;&#x0223c;1.3 &#x000c5;. The second peak of the FTs (R+&#x00394;&#x0223c;1.8 &#x000c5;) was related to the backscattering contribution of the equatorial oxygen atoms. The MS path of the axial oxygen atoms, as well as the SS and MS of the phosphate atoms are visible in the FTs in the region between R+&#x00394;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.8 and 3.4 &#x000c5;. The structural parameters of the U(VI) complexes formed in the samples at pH 2 and pH 3 demonstrated an equatorial oxygen shell at a radial distance of 2.35 to 2.36 &#x000c5; which is typical for a fivefold coordinated uranyl ion <xref rid="pone.0102447-Burns1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The radial distance of the phosphorous shell at 3.62 &#x000c5; indicated a monodentate binding of uranyl to phosphate groups. For the sample incubated at pH 3 under anoxic conditions an increased Debye-Waller factor (&#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0126 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) was calculated for the equatorial oxygen shell, and it was even higher in the samples incubated at pH 4.5 and pH 6 (&#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.02 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>), suggesting a structural disorder within this shell. Concomitantly, the radial distance of the U-O<sub>eq</sub> shell increases with increasing pH values under anoxic conditions from 2.35 &#x000c5; (pH 2) up to 2.38 &#x000c5; (pH 6). In accordance to the TRLFS studies, the high Debye-Waller factor revealed a coexistence of uranyl complexes where the uranyl ion was monodentately bound to phosphate groups (averaged U-O<sub>eq</sub> bond distance&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.35 &#x000c5;) and bidentately bound to carboxylic groups (U-O<sub>eq</sub> bond distance&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.45 &#x000c5; <xref rid="pone.0102447-Bauerlein1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>). Thus, two shells of carbon atoms (C and distal C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) as well as the strong multiple scattering along the linear U-C-C<sub>dis</sub> path were included in the shell fitting procedures of the samples incubated at pH 4.5 and 6 under anoxic conditions. In contrast to that, in the oxic sample at pH 6 the radial distance of the equatorial oxygen plane (2.27 &#x000c5;) was significantly lower compared to the distance calculated for the samples incubated at pH 2 and pH 3. This short radial distance suggested an only fourfold coordinated uranyl ion <xref rid="pone.0102447-Burns1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In accordance to that, we calculated four equatorial oxygen atoms and, moreover, a comparable number of phosphorous atoms at a radial distance of 3.59 &#x000c5;, which demonstrated that U(VI) under these conditions was complexed similar to the left model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g004">Figure 4</xref>. As already suggested by the TRLFS studies, the EXAFS spectrum of the sample incubated at pH 4.5 represents a mixture of the two above discussed complexation types. The high Debye-Waller factor calculated for the equatorial oxygen shell from the complexes formed at pH 4.5 indicates a structural inhomogeneity, caused by a mixture of complexes, exhibiting on the one hand a fivefold coordinated U(VI) bound to organic phosphate groups, and on the other hand U(VI) which was included in a mineral phase complexed by four inorganic phosphate ligands.</p><fig id="pone-0102447-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0102447.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>U <italic>L</italic>

The most likely reason for this was the detection limit of EDX. Whereas bigger uranium precipitates could be detected easily, due to their high amount of uranium, it was not possible to detect smaller precipitates or equally-distributed uranium complexes formed at the negatively charged functional groups of the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Interactions with U(VI) under moderate acidic conditions (pH 4.5 and pH 6)</title><p>Under moderate acidic conditions (pH 4.5 and pH 6), which are characteristic for many uranium-contaminated sites, the speciation of U(VI) differed from that at pH 2 and pH 3.

This was caused by complexation of U(VI) at additional deprotonated and therefore binding-capable functional groups at the cell surface. In particular, as demonstrated by Fowle and colleagues the carboxylic groups of the cell surface are involved in the uranium complexation at moderate acidic pH values <xref rid="pone.0102447-Fowle1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The efficient uranium binding by microorganisms is in general attributed to the large number of uranium-binding ligands on their thick (Gram-positive bacteria) or rather complex and multilayer (Gram-negative bacteria) cell wall structures <xref rid="pone.0102447-Bauerlein1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The cell wall of the studied here Gram-positive <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp.

Under oxic conditions enhanced formation of inorganic uranyl phosphate mineral phases was observed. TRLFS and XAS analyses demonstrated that at pH 4.5 the major part, and at pH 6 the total amount of the added uranium was precipitated within 48 hours in meta-autunite-like mineral phases. In the samples treated with uranium at pH 4.5 under oxic conditions the spectroscopic data revealed a mixture of organic and inorganic uranyl phosphate complexes. However, the low radial distance of the U-O<sub>eq</sub> shell (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.27 &#x000c5;) indicated that most of the uranium present in this sample existed in the uranyl phosphate mineral form. This finding is in contrast to the TRLFS results, where the luminescence emission maxima correspond better to those of organic uranyl complexes. However, the overestimated amount of the latter by TRLFS data was caused by the unequal luminescence properties of organic and inorganic uranyl phosphate complexes. We calculated by using the luminescence data and the amount of accumulated U(VI) of the oxic samples incubated at pH 2 (exclusively organic uranyl phosphate complexes) and pH 6 (exclusively inorganic uranyl phosphate complexes) that the luminescence emission of the uranyl mineral phases was more than ten times lower, compared to those of the organic uranyl phosphate complexes (Figure S3 and Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102447.s001">File S1</xref>). TEM studies of the sample incubated at pH 4.5 demonstrated that uranium was located at the cell surface as well as intracellularly. Such intracellular uranium deposits were detected only in about 30% of the cells and exclusively in those cells which exhibit damaged cell membranes, which suggested that the formation of intracellular uranium deposits was a consequence of increased cell permeability after cell death. This observation supported the finding of Boswell and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0102447-Boswell1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> who demonstrated that U(VI) cannot enter intact cells.</p><p>TRLF spectroscopic analyses of the bacterial cell samples, grown anaerobically and treated with U(VI) under anoxic conditions demonstrates the formation of uranyl carboxylate complexes under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t002">Table 2</xref>).

In most cases the release of orthophosphate, which is involved in the uranium precipitation, was attributed to the activity of various phosphatases, which release inorganic orthophosphate from organic phosphate compounds. Corresponding enzyme activities had been described for a large variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as in archaea <xref rid="pone.0102447-Dassa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102447-Satta1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102447-Kurosawa1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. It has been demonstrated that in the presence of an organic phosphate source a bacterial phosphatase, which was over expressed in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains, could release sufficient amounts of orthophosphate to precipitate uranium even from low concentrated (2&#x000b7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M uranium) solutions <xref rid="pone.0102447-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Moreover, recent studies postulated, that U(VI) biomineralization based on the hydrolization of organophosphate by heterotrophic bacteria is a promising bioremediation strategy to immobilize uranium <xref rid="pone.0102447-Merroun2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and that even under anoxic conditions the U(VI) phosphate biomineralization has a higher immobilization potential than the bioreduction to U(IV) <xref rid="pone.0102447-Salome1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. We observed that under moderate acidic conditions the phosphatase activity of <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. JG-TB8 and the corresponding release of orthophosphate were strongly reduced under anoxic conditions. This finding is in contrast to the results of Beazley and colleagues, who found an only slightly reduced orthophosphate release by the facultative anaerobic bacterium <italic>Rahnella</italic> sp. Y9602 under anaerobic conditions after incubation for 12 hours, resulting in quantitatively similar uranyl phosphate precipitation <xref rid="pone.0102447-Beazley3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover, the observed U(VI) precipitation rate by this <italic>Rahnella</italic> species during the first hour of incubation was even higher under anaerobic conditions. The observed reduction of the phosphatase activity of JG-TB8 is also in contrast to studies using isolated enzymes (acid and alkaline phosphatases), where the specific enzyme activity did not change significantly <xref rid="pone.0102447-Goel1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, and the phosphatase activity of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which was shown to be dramatically enhanced after a shifting from oxic to anoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0102447-Dassa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The reasons for the reduction of the phosphatase activity of Paenibacillus sp. JG-TB8 under anaerobic conditions may include the suboptimal pH for the produced phosphatase(s), or a lack of active co-factors (metals, other organic co-factors) necessary for enzyme activity, under these conditions. Missing organophosphates as substrate for the phosphatase(s), however, could be excluded in this respect as for the activity studies <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate was provided as phosphate source.</p><p>The orthophosphate release in the samples corresponds well to the phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). However, for the release of orthophosphate by microbial phosphatases organic phosphate sources are needed as substrate. As we did not provide any additional phosphate source, the only possible origin of phosphate-containing organic substrates were the released cell compounds of the damaged cells. Live/Dead staining demonstrated that about 10% and 57% of the cells in the oxic samples incubated at pH 6 and pH 4.5, respectively, showed damaged cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102447-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The comparison of the control versus the uranium-treated cell samples along all pH- and aeration conditions also demonstrated that a significant reduction of the orthophosphate due to the addition of uranium was only observed in the oxic samples incubated at pH 4.5 and pH 6. This reduction additionally confirmed the uranium biomineralization by the orthophosphate released due to the phosphatase activity. Nevertheless, the observed rapid association of uranium with the cells at both pH values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102447-t001">Table 1</xref>) suggested an initial U(VI) binding to functional groups at the cell surface, which subsequently served as nucleation sites for metal precipitation and biomineralization. A corresponding mechanism has also been suggested for the radionuclide accumulation by <italic>Rahnella</italic> sp. <xref rid="pone.0102447-Beazley3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and <italic>Citrobacter</italic> sp. <xref rid="pone.0102447-Macaskie3" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that U(VI) was complexed by the cells of the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp.

In contrast to that under moderate acidic conditions, which are relevant for many uranium contaminated sites, the immobilization of uranium depended on the pH (pH 4.5 or pH 6) and also on the aeration conditions. JG-TB8 precipitated significant amounts of U(VI) in uranyl phosphate mineral phases under moderate acidic and oxic conditions, whereas under anoxic conditions no corresponding precipitation occurred due to the dramatic inhibition of the phosphatase activity of the cells. As we added, in contrast to other studies, no additional phosphate source, the organic phosphates needed for the enzymatic release of orthophosphate were provided by the part of the cells which degraded during the incubation with uranium. Hence, this study demonstrates that the metabolism of the facultative anaerobic strain <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. JG-TB8, which is indigenous in uranium-contaminated sites, underwent aeration-dependent changes, which strongly influenced the capability to immobilize U(VI). The immobilization ability of the strain was connected to the phosphatase activity of the cells, which in turn was strongly influenced by the aeration conditions. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the uranium mobility in contaminated ecosystems and suggest an air ventilation of uranium-contaminated sites as a possible eco-management option to improve the conditions for U(VI) biomineralization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0102447.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>Contains Figure S1, Phylogenetic classification of <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> JG-TB 8.
