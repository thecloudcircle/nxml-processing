Although, the effects of both soil temperature and moisture on <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> are well known, there is scant knowledge about what climatic drivers affect the occurrence of the pathogen on a large scale. Here, we investigate what climatic drivers determine <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence in olive-growing areas in southern Spain. In order to bridge this gap in knowledge, a large-scale field survey was carried out to collect data on the occurrence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> in 779 olive groves in Granada province. Forty models based on competing combinations of climatic variables were fitted and evaluated using information-theoretic methods. A model that included a multiplicative combination of seasonal and extreme climatic variables was found to be the most viable one. Isothermality and the seasonal distribution of precipitation were the most important variables influencing the occurrence of the pathogen. The isothermal effect was in turn modulated by the seasonality of rainfall, and this became less negative as seasonality increases. Thus, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurs more frequently in olive-growing areas where the day-night temperature oscillation is lower than the summer-winter one. We also found that irrigation reduced the influence of isothermality on occurrence. Our results demonstrate that long-term compound climatic factors rather than &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d; variables, such as annual trends, can better explain the spatial patterns of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence in Mediterranean, southern Spain. One important implication of our study is that appropriate irrigation management, when temperature oscillation approaches optimal conditions for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> to thrive, may reduce the appearance of symptoms in olive trees.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>E.

This pathogen is a highly polyphagous fungus that infects hundreds of dicots, including herbaceous and woody plants, causing, chlorosis, necrosis, stunting, vascular discolouration, and wilting [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> is of great concern in Mediterranean olive groves [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], where the olive species under cultivation (i.e., <italic>Olea europaea</italic> L. subsp. <italic>europaea</italic>) have crucial economic, social and environmental value, and therefore, the European Union&#x02019;s agricultural policy is mainly aimed at protecting it [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Verticillium wilt is considered to be the most damaging disease for olives in Mediterranean countries as it causes yield losses and tree mortality [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This disease thrives especially in intensively-farmed olive groves in Andalusia (southern Spain) [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which is the world's leading olive tree grower, producing 900,000 tons of olive oil and 380,000 tons of table olives per year from 1.5 million hectares of farm land [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In western Andalusia, Verticillium wilt affects about 38&#x02013;39% of crops [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while in the province of Granada (eastern Andalusia) <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> affects around 14% of crops [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Verticillium wilt symptoms are divided into two categories which are associated with its two recognized pathotypes (i.e., virulent forms): defoliating (D), which is potentially lethal to the infested plant, and non-defoliating (ND), which causes a slow decline and partial defoliation [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The predominance of virulent forms in Andalusian olive groves has strong implications for managing the disease [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Current protective measures for olives combine chemical treatments, resistant or tolerant cultivars or rootstocks, biological control, and physical and cultural solutions [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this integrated strategy has not proved fully successful, as the pathogen has a wide range of hosts, and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> produces resting structures, i.e., microsclerotia, capable of surviving even when there is no host in the soil for years [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In fact, inoculum density in the soil is the main factor behind the spread of the disease in olive trees [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Verticillium wilt development is driven by several factors such as host plant, inoculum density, pathogen dispersal mechanisms, and environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The latter may, in turn, be influenced by climate change [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specifically, the spread of the disease depends on inoculum density in the soil, which is strongly influenced by soil temperature and seasonal fluctuations [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Verticillium wilt is mainly observed in the spring, whereas it decreases in the summer due to high temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Previous studies have identified some abiotic factors behind the occurrence of the pathogen in olive groves in the Granada province [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These authors found that <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> was up to 3 times more prevalent in irrigated olive groves than rainfed ones, and was more frequent when plant material came from nurseries than when it did not. In fact, the prevalence of the pathogen in olive plantations whose plant material came from nurseries reached 24.5%. Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of using cuttings which have been certified as free of the pathogen, and the role the infected plant material has in spreading the disease to non-infested cropping areas. Additionally, slope gradients and soil type both influence occurrence of the pathogen. For instance, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence was higher in olive groves located in saline, alkaline and steep slope soils [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The effects of both soil temperature and moisture on <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> are well known locally (i.e. plot scale). For instance, Verticillium wilt in olive is favored by soil temperatures between 20 &#x02013; 25&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The D pathotype is promoted by soil temperatures, ranging from 16 to 24&#x000b0;C whereas the ND pathotype thrived in lower soil temperatures, ranging from 16 to 20&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, several studies have shown that disease development, severity and inoculum density in olive fields are usually higher in wetter soils [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, there is scant knowledge about how climatic factors affect the occurrence of the pathogen on a large scale. In fact, fungal plant pathogens are particularly under-represented in climatic niche modeling studies [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] but see [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Bridging this gap in knowledge remains a major challenge in research, partly due to the absence of spatially explicit data on the occurrence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> on a larger scale. One notable study is that by [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] on the diversity of the pathogen population in southern Spain. Identifying the climatic drivers behind the occurrence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> on a large scale will provide an insight into the pathogen ecology and help optimize strategies for managing the disease in olive groves.</p><p>Here, we used the data set collected by [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in the Granada province to determine by modelling what climatic factors affect <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence in Mediterranean olive-growing areas of southern Spain. To this end, we tested a series of models with different combinations of climatic variables representing competing hypotheses, and used information-theoretic methods to select the most parsimonious model [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The sampling survey, isolation and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> identification protocols used in this research are based on previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area and sampling survey design</title><p>There are 183,000 ha of olive groves in the province of Granada, making it the third largest olive oil producer in Andalusia [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this province, olives are distributed among olive-growing areas which vary greatly in terms of their physical characteristics, management practices, olive varieties and environmental factors [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, a stratified double-sampling technique was designed in order to select the olive groves [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This technique is commonly applied to heterogeneous populations and collecting data based on sample sizes that are proportional to the relative size of the strata [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Proportions in the first sampling level were based on the surface area (ha) of olive groves in each olive-growing zone.

In addition, Akaike weights (w<sub>i</sub>) were calculated to rank models with &#x00394;AIC &#x0003c; 2, in turn. In order to verify whether the interactions between climatic and abiotic factors were significant, we included interaction terms between climatic variables, watering and plant material origin in the top-ranked model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232648.s001">S1 Table</xref> for details).</p><p>We assessed how accurate the predictions of the model were by comparing the Log&#x02010;Loss [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] achieved by the null-model (i.e., intercept-only) as a baseline with that of the top-ranked model using a 10-fold cross-validation of the presence-absence sampled data. Log&#x02010;Loss measures the uncertainty of fitted probabilities by comparing them to actual observations. Each data partition was made by randomly splitting the data into 10 distinct blocks and using 9 to train and 1 to test. A key assumption for regression is that model residuals were not correlated, we checked this assumption by estimating the Moran&#x02019;s I statistic using the inverse of the distances between observations as weights [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

Isothermality had a negative effect on <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic>, with a predictive decrease in occurrence of 53.9% (<italic>p-value</italic> = 0.0006) when this variable increased by 0.45% in rainfed olive groves. However, rainfall seasonality had no discernable marginal effect on pathogen occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232648.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The top-ranked model included an interaction term between both climatic variables. We found that when rainfall seasonality increased by 4.4 (i.e., standard deviation of 1) the effect of isothermality on <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence rose by 86.5% (<italic>p-value</italic> = 0.04) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232648.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232648.g003">3</xref>), and therefore, this effect became less negative. Considering the relative importance of the interaction between climatic factors and watering and plant material origin in the top-ranked model, we found that by including the interaction between isothermality and watering, the overall model performance improved (AIC = 559.8) and there was a significant effect on <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232648.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232648.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

Finally, the model comparison results showed no evidence of improving predictive performance by the BRT models compared to that obtained by the top-ranked binomial model, supporting the linear regression modeling approach adopted in our study (see S3 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232648.s005">S1 Appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> is one of the most harmful pathogens in the Mediterranean region [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], but, surprisingly, no studies have identified what climatic drivers determine the occurrence of this pathogen on a large scale. We found that long-term compound climatic factors rather than &#x02018;primary&#x02019; variables, such as annual trends, provided a more comprehensive explanation of the spatial patterns of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence in olive-growing areas in southern Spain. Here, compound climatic factors refer to climatic variables that integrate different aspects of climate components at multiple temporal scales. For example, isothermality represents the ratio between temperature oscillations at two temporal scales: daily and seasonal, and it captures wider ecological trends better than the temperature for a given day (i.e., a &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d; variable) due to the inherent variability associated with weather. Isothermality was the most important climatic factor for the pathogen occurrence, suggesting an intricate relationship between <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> and climate as discussed below.</p><p>In the Western Mediterranean basin, seasonal rainfall regimes are equinoctial, with a rainy season in autumn and another secondary rainy period in spring [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In contrast, maximum and minimum temperatures are reached in summer and winter, respectively. Specifically, in Granada province, precipitation mainly occurs in November and early spring, while there is almost no precipitation in July and August. Summers are extremely hot and winters moderately cold, with large variations in temperature between the day and night (maximum temperature &#x0003e; 30&#x000b0;C; minimum temperature &#x0003c; 20&#x000b0;C) [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thus, high rainfall seasonality and isothermality, i.e., the two climatic factors that determined Verticillium wilt occurrence in Granada province, implies more varied distribution of rainfall throughout seasons, as well as greater differences between cold and hot periods, with mild temperatures in between. Our results, confirmed findings from previous reports, by demonstrating that weather oscillation helped <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> thrive in Mediterranean olive groves, i.e., areas where rainfall mainly occurred in autumn and early spring, and with mild temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. According to [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the optimal temperature range for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> to thrive is between 22&#x000b0;-25&#x000b0;C. The optimum temperature of the soil for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> was around 24&#x000b0;C, after which there was a decline in the abundance of the pathogen when soil temperature exceeded 28&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Several authors observed that a high temperature in summer can suppress <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> in olive trees [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>We also corroborated previous results that indicated irrigation was a significant abiotic factor for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], since there was a strong positive correlation between irrigated olive groves and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence. Furthermore, we provided new findings on the relationship between climate and watering by showing how irrigation can mitigate the negative effect of isothermality on occurrence. Many studies have shown a relationship between <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> and water abundance in soil. The inoculum of the pathogen was more frequently found in moist soil around drippers [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, the disease incidence was positively associated with the number of years of irrigation and water dosage [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The damage caused by <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> in Mediterranean olive groves has steadily increased over the last few decades due to the implementation of irrigation systems [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], which may help propagules of the pathogen to disperse [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A similar process occurs in cotton, which is not affected by Verticillium wilt under rainfed conditions, although it is with irrigation [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In accordance with previous results, we propose that water from irrigation may keep soil temperature close to the optimal range for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic>, and hence help it survive in areas where day-tonight temperature oscillations are higher. Regarding the marginal effect of the plant material origin, our results were also consistent with that found by [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in which young plants from nurseries were found to increase the probability of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence. This result underlines the importance of abiotic factors in reducing disease risk during the early stages of cultivation. Infected planting material from the nursery is one of the main reasons for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> infestation in free-pathogen growing areas [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In order to prevent the pathogen from spreading, particularly the most virulent forms, such as the defoliating pathotype (D), farmers should use only pathogen-tested propagative material. Since the role of non-climatic factors on the pathogen is beyond our study, we recommend reading the above mentioned article for further information.</p><p>We expected annual precipitation to be a significant factor affecting the occurrence of the pathogen in olive groves. However, we found that models that included rainfall seasonality had a better fit. This finding may be due to the fact that optimal soil moisture and temperature conditions are required to occur simultaneously. Rainfall in semi-arid areas, such as around Granada, is scarce and irregularly distributed in time and space [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Since <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> thrives in mild temperature conditions [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], rainy periods must coincide with warmer ones. These findings highlight the seasonal nature of the pathogen, as reported in other studies on Mediterranean olive growing-areas, which found <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> caused wilt disease in olive trees in late-spring and early-winter [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232648.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, our results showed that rainfall seasonality modulated the negative effect of isothermality, which became more negative as the seasonality decreased. We propose that the high occurrence of the pathogen found in the northwest of Granada province [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] can be explained by the combination of low rainfall seasonality and high isothermality that characterizes such area.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for controlling the spread of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> in semi-arid Mediterranean olive-growing areas, as the risk of Verticillium wilt can be reduced by managing irrigation. Since irrigation may reduce the negative influence of isothermality on the pathogen occurrence, shifting from rainfed to irrigated olive groves may entails a higher risk in those areas with low isothermality. This combination draws areas potentially susceptible to <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence, for example, the irrigated growing-olive areas located in the north of the study area which have low isothermality and the highest occurrence of Verticillium wilt in Granada province [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, the low pathogen&#x02019;s occurrence found in the south [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] may be a result of the conjunction of rainfed olive grove and high isothermality. We showed that <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> is a highly seasonal pathogen that requires rainy and warm periods to occur simultaneously. On this basis, reducing irrigation in spring and autumn could prevent the disease from spreading, particularly in areas with low rainfall seasonality and isothermality. Our results concur with that of [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], who suggested that scheduling irrigation treatment on the basis of rainfall could be a good strategy for maintaining soil moisture below levels which are favourable to the pathogen. They concluded that daily -as opposed to both weekly and biweekly- irrigation helps Verticillium wilt thrives. They also advised that in order to reduce symptoms of the disease, soil water content should be lower than 24% and irrigation should be done on a biweekly basis. However, it should be stressed that although less frequent irrigation could reduce the risk of Verticillium wilt, this will need to be balanced with the water needs of the olive trees in order to achieve good and high-quality oil yields. For instance, irrigation prior to anthesis produced lower fusarium head blight than continuous irrigation throughout anthesis [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. However, finishing irrigation prior to anthesis resulted in reduced yields in comparison with continuous irrigation. Water stress from inflorescence development (mid-April to the start of June) to fruit set (May to June) should be avoided. Also, the periods of initial fruit growth and oil accumulation in the autumn are sensitive to water deficits (September to October) [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Consequently, there are 3 extremely critical periods for crop productivity, during which time soil moisture must be kept optimal. Unfortunately, these periods also coincide with Verticilllium wilt development. Therefore, studies need to be made to determine disease development, soil moisture levels and rainfall during those critical periods to assess influences on the pathogen and olive tree yields. Evidentially the response of any given soil-borne disease to the range of ways of managing irrigation varies widely and must be addressed for each individual plant-pathogen system [<xref rid="pone.0232648.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study is the first to explore what climatic factors influence the occurrence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> in Mediterranean olive groves in southern Spain.

Since <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> thrives in mild temperature conditions, rainy periods must coincide with warm ones in order to provide optimal conditions for the pathogen to thrive. Therefore, appropriate irrigation management in periods when the pathogen spreads, i.e., spring and autumn, may prevent symptoms of the disease. However, reducing irrigation during spring and autumn may also have undesirable side effects such as decreased yields. Thus, future studies at finer scales that consider microclimate conditions in periods in which Verticillium wilt develop are required to assess how to best manage irrigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232648.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of model fit when including interaction terms between climatic variables and covariates.</title><p>Each pairwise interaction was separately included in the top-ranked model for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> occurrence (see <xref rid="pone.0232648.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> in the main manuscript).

</p><p>PONE-D-20-11197</p><p>Climatic drivers of Verticillium dahliae occurrence in Mediterranean olive-growing areas of southern Spain</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Rodr&#x000ed;guez,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>Both referees are overall positive about the manuscript, although some important concerns have been raised about specific methodological aspects and the discussion of the main findings. Specifically, one of the referee suggested to explore more sophisticated modelling techniques (e.g. Boosted regression trees) to account for covariates interactions. In addition, the choice of environmental predictors has been judged inappropriate with respect of the spatial scale of the study. Even more importantly, the link between study results and species ecology was not adequately emphasized and discussed. I strongly suggest to take comprehensively into account such valuable suggestions, which can surely improve the overall quality of the study.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Aug 29 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

Moreover, the results of your study may be very helpful to provide information about how irrigation could be better managed in order to modulate the effect of climate on fungus&#x02019;s thrive and reduce the risk of pathogen&#x02019;s spread.</p><p>Nevertheless, before I recommend this paper for publication, the authors should address some issues that I detected.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>- Line 47: I would write &#x0201c;in Andalusia (southern Spain) which is the world&#x02019;s leading olive tree grower&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Methods</p><p>- Line 139: A citation about the application of the Spearman rank-correlation is needed.</p><p>- Line 159: There are other studies that have investigated how climatic factors might affect the distribution of plant</p><p>pathogenic fungi, e.g.: Bosso, L., Luchi, N., Maresi, G., Cristinzio, G., Smeraldo, S., &#x00026; Russo, D. (2017). Predicting current and future disease outbreaks of Diplodia sapinea shoot blight in Italy: species distribution models as a tool for forest management planning.</p><p>- Line 186: Please, clarify if you have used the Log Loss with presence-only test data.</p><p>- Line 198 and line 212: Please, remove citations from results session and eventually move them to discussion session.</p><p>- Lines 228-229: Authors should show the full results of log loss evaluation in supplementary materials.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>- Lines 236-237: Authors should specify why they use the term &#x0201c;sophisticated&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d; for the different variables.</p><p>- Line 248: Please, a citation is needed.</p><p>- Lines 257-259: Authors say that irrigation mitigate the negative effect of isothermality on V. dahliae occurrence, however, if I have correctly understood, from fig.2 it results that the combination between isothermality and watering showed an increasing negative effect on occurrences. Please, could you better explain this sentence?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Dear authors,</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review the manuscript titled &#x02018;Climatic drivers of Verticillium dahliae occurrence in Mediterranean olive-growing areas of southern Spain&#x02019;. This manuscript presents a straightforward study, using species distribution modelling techniques to interrogate conditions potentially favourable to the studied organism. The methods used in this paper are simple but corrected executed. However, there is an argument to be made that with such comprehensive data and well-supported knowledge on drivers of occurrence, more nuanced techniques could be used to explore the research question further (e.g. boosted regression trees are especially suited for interrogating covariate interactions &#x02013; given that interacting conditions are found to be very important, I think you should consider trying such models).</p><p>Furthermore, the study tries to interrogate landscape-scale drivers of species occurrence with broad WorldClim climatic variables. This is difficult, because climate effects are often more important/easily-observed on larger scales &#x02013; one would imagine that monthly or even weekly temperature and precipitation averages may have a more pronounced effect on this scale. Even better, soil moisture instead of precipitation, and fine-grained terrain relief data, may also prove to be important to the species, based on previous research highlighted in this manuscript.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;I congratulate with the authors for the excellent work. All my comments have been successfully addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Dear authors,</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to re-review the manuscript titled &#x02018;Climatic drivers of Verticillium dahliae occurrence in Mediterranean olive-growing areas</p><p>of southern Spain&#x02019;. I am satisfied with the authors&#x02019; responses to the recommendations I raised in the first round. I believe this manuscript is now robust and valuable, with only a few minor tweaks, it can make a nice addition to the journal.</p><p>Although the changes from the previous version are not substantial, I am convinced by the authors&#x02019; responses to my previous comments, which demonstrated their comprehensive knowledge of the study system and I can now better appreciate the reasonings behind their conclusions. Below I detail my updated views on the concerns I raised in my previous review.</p><p>Regarding trialling more complicated modelling method: I am impressed that the authors fitted BRTs with multiple sets of parameters, and tested model performance rigorously. I think this result (that GLMs beat BRTs in performance) is worth mentioning in the text, or at least in an appendix, because other model-focused readers may also be interested in whether different modelling methods are tried for this research problem.</p><p>Regarding choice of covariates: I am convinced by the authors&#x02019; response that the covariates tried here are most suited to the study. Although I am still wondering whether seasonal and/or monthly climate data should be tested, since the authors identified that warm and wet conditions are most imported to V.dahliae, so maybe the specific susceptible month(s) are worth focusing on.</p><p>Regarding better contextualising the favourable conditions to V.dahliae: I think the new appendix maps of predictors will suffice, and I agree with the authors that occurrence prediction maps are not needed for this study.</p><p>I have a few other minor suggestions:</p><p>In table 1, I am not sure whether the hypothesis column is necessary, I believe the information is better conveyed in text, through a more detailed elaboration on how the top models supported the specific hypothesis.</p><p>Line 245: I suggest &#x0201c;compound&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;composite&#x0201d; over &#x0201c;sophisticated&#x0201d;, but I agree with the &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d; wording.</p><p>Line 286-290: I think the observed effect of plant nursery origin in the model deserves more discussion. Although it is beyond the scope of this study, it hints that non-climatic factors are also significant in moderating disease risk, this is worthwhile knowing from a management perspective.</p><p>Appendix S2: the colour scale on the last figure is confusing (it looks intuitively like a value that ranges from 0 to 1), I suggest changing it.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
