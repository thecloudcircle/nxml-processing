The therapeutic options for malignant gliomas are limited and far from satisfactory, and novel treatment strategies are urgently required to improve the outcome of the disease. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation, motility and survival. The dysregulation of this signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of malignant gliomas. In the present study, GSK1904529A, a small molecule inhibitor of IGF-1R, suppressed glioma cell viability, induced glioma cell apoptosis and inhibited glioma cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, GSK1904529A inhibited glioma tumor growth and induced tumor cell apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested GSK1904529A as a promising agent for the treatment of malignant glioma.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glioma</kwd><kwd>insulin-like growth factor I receptor</kwd><kwd>GSK1904529A</kwd><kwd>cell viability</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>tumor growth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor in humans, accounting for &#x0003e;80% of all brain malignancies (<xref rid="b1-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Gliomas are classified into astrocytomas (Grade I&#x02013;IV), oligo-dendrogliomas (Grade II and III), ependymomas (Grade I&#x02013;III) and mixed oligo-astrocytomas (Grade II and III), according to the World Health Organization (<xref rid="b1-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Glioblastoma, also termed glioblastoma multiforme, is a Grade IV astrocytoma, which is the most aggressive form of glioma, and accounts for ~60&#x02013;70% of all malignant gliomas worldwide (<xref rid="b1-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The prognosis for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma is particularly poor, with 1-year and 5-year survival rates at ~36% and 5%, respectively (<xref rid="b1-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Current treatments for malignant gliomas include maximal surgical resection whenever possible, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, however, no significant improvements in survival rates have been achieved (<xref rid="b5-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and there remains urgent requirement for the identification of novel molecular targets and therapies.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor, which binds to IGF1 and IGF2. Upon ligand binding, IGF-1R activates the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways and regulates cell proliferation and survival (<xref rid="b6-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The IGF/IGF-1R signaling axis has been implicated in the development of several types of solid tumor by promoting the growth and survival of malignant cells (<xref rid="b7-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that this pathway is also involved in the development of gliomas (<xref rid="b10-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, the IGF/IGF-1R signaling pathway may be a potential target for the treatment of glioma. GSK1904529A is a small molecule inhibitor of IGF-1R and has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of several tumor cells by inhibiting receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling (<xref rid="b15-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the present study, the antitumor activity of GSK1904529A in glioma was assessed.

The non-migrating cells on the upper chambers were removed and images of the migrated cells on the lower chambers were captured using a microscope in at least five randomly selected fields.

The animals were reared in a standard clean mouse facility. When the tumors reached 70 mm<sup>3</sup> in size, the mice were randomly divided into a control group and GSK1904529A-treatment groups (6 mice/group). The mice in the GSK1904529A-treatment group received either 10 or 20 mg/kg GSK1904529A daily, and the control group received the same volume of vehicle control. The tumor volumes and body weights of the mice were measured daily.

Therefore, the present study examined the effect of GSK1904529A on glioma cell viability. U87MG cells, commonly used human glioblastoma cells, were treated with increased concentrations of GSK1904529A and cell viability was determined. The data demonstrated that GSK1904529A significantly reduced the viability of U87MG cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of ~50 nM (<xref rid="f1-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This suppression also increased as the duration of incubation increased (<xref rid="f1-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).

The present study examined the effect of GSK1904529A on the apoptosis of glioma cells. The U87MG cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GSK1904529A. The sub-G1 DNA content was determined using flow cytometry and was used to measure apoptosis. The data revealed that treatment with GSK1904529A significantly increased the sub-G1 DNA content in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="f2-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To confirm that apoptosis was induced by GSK1904529A, Hoechst staining was performed. The GSK1904529A-treated U87MG cells exhibited condensed and fragmented nuclei (<xref rid="f2-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The number of cells with an apoptotic morphology increased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="f2-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

Therefore, the present study determined the effect of GSK1904529A on glioma cell migration. A Transwell migration assay was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of GSK1904529A. As shown in <xref rid="f3-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>, the migration of the U87MG cells was significantly inhibited by treatment with GSK1904529A, and the inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner.

The U87MG cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the axillary regions of mice. Following tumor establishment, the mice were treated with GSK1904529A or vehicle control and the tumor volume was monitored. The data revealed that the mice treated with GSK1904529A exhibited substantially reduced tumor volumes compared with the vehicle-treated group (<xref rid="f4-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The suppression of tumor growth was correlated with the dose of GSK1904529A (<xref rid="f4-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In addition, the treatment was well tolerated, as no weight loss was observed (<xref rid="f4-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Further investigation revealed that treatment with GSK1904529A induced marked apoptosis in the tumor cells (<xref rid="f4-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), which was consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data.

Efforts have been made to develop novel compounds and chemotherapeutics, however, these are focused on a limited number of targets, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) (<xref rid="b18-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). IGF/IGF-1R signaling has been implicated in malignant gliomas, suggesting it a potential therapeutic target. IGF antisense therapies are currently under evaluation in clinical trials (<xref rid="b10-mmr-12-03-3381" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the present study, the antitumor activity of a small-molecule inhibitor of IGF-1R, GSK1904529A, in glioma was assessed. The results demonstrated that GSK1904529A inhibited tumor growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by inducing tumor cell apoptosis and inhibiting tumor cell migration. These results suggested that GSK1904529A is an effective compound for targeting IGF-1R and for the treatment of malignant gliomas.</p><p>Gliomas are a type of brain tumor, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier increases the difficulty for chemotherapeutic drugs to access the tumor. Further physiological investigations are required by introducing tumors into the brain to further assess the efficacy of GSK1904529A in the treatment of gliomas. With the development of increasing numbers of chemotherapeutic compounds, the combined therapy of GSK1904529A with other compounds may also be evaluated in the future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study suggested the importance of the IGF/IGF-1R signaling pathway for the treatment of glioma. In addition, the results indicated that GSK1904529A may be a promising candidate for the treatment of glioma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to
