E2F3, miR-125a and DKK3 have been reported to be involved in various cancer types, but their detailed roles in GC have not been fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A QRT-PCR assay was used to examine the expression of E2F3, miR-125a and DKK3 in metastatic and nonmetastatic GC tissues. DKK3 plasmids, DKK3 shRNA, miR-125a mimic and miR-125a inhibitor were transfected into BGC823 cells to evaluate the biological functions of DKK3 and miR-125a. A scratch wound healing assay and Transwell assay were utilized to determine the migratory and invasive ability of BGC823 cells transfected with the DKK3 plasmids, DKK3 shRNA, miR-125a mimic and miR-125a inhibitor. Moreover, qRT-PCR and WB analysis were used to analyse the mRNA and protein expression levels of metastasis-related genes after proper transfection. The target relationship between miR-125a and the DKK3 mRNA 3&#x02032;UTR was determined by a dual luciferase reporter assay, while the interaction between E2F3 and miR-125a was analysed by a ChIP assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The clinical data showed that the DKK3 expression level in metastatic GC samples was significantly less than that in nonmetastatic GC samples, whereas the E2F3 and miR-125a expression levels in metastatic GC samples were notably greater than those in nonmetastatic GC samples. Moreover, knockdown of DKK3 and overexpression of miR-125a markedly promoted the migratory and invasive abilities of GC cells. Additionally, the protein and mRNA expression levels of metastasis-related genes, including N-cadherin, Vimentin, MMP2 and MMP9, were markedly decreased in the DKK3 and miR-125a inhibitor groups compared to their control groups and markedly increased in the DKK3 shRNA and miR-125a groups compared with the control group. Finally, a dual luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay showed that E2F3 binds to the miR-125a promoter and that the DKK3 mRNA 3&#x02032;UTR is a direct target of miR-125a. Furthermore, analysis of Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves also confirmed the regulatory role of E2F3 on miR-125a. Additionally, BGC823 cells transfected with E2F3 plasmids and shRNA downregulated and upregulated the expression of DKK3, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Our results suggested that E2F3 might play a tumour-promoting role in the metastasis and progression of GC by regulating the miR-125a/DKK3 axis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gastric cancer (GC)</kwd><kwd>E2F3/miR-125a/DKK3 regulatory axis</kwd><kwd>Metastasis and progression of tumours</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005153</institution-id><institution>China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81201893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pei</surname><given-names>Yihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common malignancy following lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer death, second only to lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although there has been a universal decrease in the incidence and mortality of GC worldwide, it was still reported that up to 2017, there were approximately 990,000 people diagnosed with GC worldwide, of whom approximately 738,000 die from this disease every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, GC remains a major public health issue that seriously threatens human life. Accumulating evidence has shown that control of the disease mainly depends on early diagnosis and proper treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, most patients with GC are either asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms in the early stage; therefore, patients are not treated in the optimal treatment period. In fact, a high proportion of patients with GC are diagnosed at an advanced stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although current therapeutic strategies, including surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, have rapidly developed, the five&#x02011;year survival rate of GC remains rather poor (approximately 5&#x02013;20%), which might be attributed to disease recurrence as a result of metastasis and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Except for genetic factors, previous studies have demonstrated that GC is a complex and multistep disease affected by environmental and lifestyle factors, such as <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>Hp</italic>) infection, Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus infection, excessive salt intake, and tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, epigenetic regulation has been found to participate in the progression of GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, clinical and scientific interests are predominantly focused on the discovery of useful potential biomarkers for non-invasive early detection and new effective therapeutic targets in patients with GC.</p><p id="Par21">MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are a class of small, endogenous, conserved, non-coding RNAs that are typically 18&#x02013;24 nucleotides in length, suppress mRNA translation of target genes in a complementary base-pairing manner with the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of mRNAs, and they are frequently observed in various tumours, including GC, and act as tumour suppressors or oncogenic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, miR-31 inhibits tumour invasion and metastasis by targeting RhoA in human GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; miR-6852 suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by targeting forkhead box J1 (FOXJ1) in GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; and miR-618 restricts metastasis in GC by downregulating the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, miRNAs during tumorigenesis of GC have received increasing attention in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. miR-125a has been confirmed to be involved in the development of many cancers, such as breast cancer, hepatocellular cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, a large number of studies have revealed that miR-125a also plays an important role in GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For instance, miR-125a targets STAT3 to regulate GC cell migration and invasion and could be an independent prognostic factor in GC by modulating the proliferation of human GC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, the upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms of miR-125a in GC remain unclear.</p><p id="Par22">E2F3, which is a transcription activator, is crucial to multiple cell processes, including the cell cycle, cell differentiation, DNA damage response, cell death, and cancer development; furthermore, it has been verified that it could serve as an unfavourable prognostic predictor for patients with advanced clinical stages of GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis identified that E2F3 can combine with miR-125a. Furthermore, dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3) has been identified as a tumour suppressor, and DKK3 is typically used as a cancer biomarker and therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, bioinformatics analysis also revealed that miR-125a directly targets the 3&#x02032;-UTR of DKK3 mRNA. Collectively, in this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of E2F3, miR-125a and DKK3 in the progression of GC and the regulatory mechanisms between E2F3, miR-125a and DKK3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue samples</title><p id="Par23">Thirty nonmetastatic GC tissues and 30 metastatic GC tissues were collected from patients with GC who underwent surgical resection with no systemic or local treatment before surgery at ZhongShan Hospital, XiaMen University, from January 2017 to December 2017.

To evaluate the role of DKK3 in the metastasis of GC, we analysed the expression levels of DKK3 in human GC tissues, and the migratory and invasive ability of GC cells was determined after DKK3-overexpression and DKK3 shRNA plasmid transfection. The general and clinical information of 60 patients with metastatic or nonmetastatic GC are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Therefore, it was necessary to further explore the regulatory effect of miR-125a and DKK3 on the expression of cell metastasis-related genes, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, MMP2 and MMP9.

Second, the mRNA and protein expression levels of E2F3 were analysed in GC cell lines by qRT-PCR and WB assays.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par41">For the past few decades, GC incidence and mortality have markedly decreased in most areas of the world, but it is still a disease that is associated with a poor prognosis and outcome, mainly due to its progression and widespread metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, based on the complex and multifactorial pathogenesis of GC, current treatment methods, such as surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemotherapy integrated with Chinese medicine, do not distinctly improve the survival of patients with GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying tumour progression and metastasis may contribute to the development of novel targeted therapies for GC. Studies have demonstrated that abnormalities in genetic factor alterations are closely associated with the occurrence and progression of GC; therefore, investigators have been focused on the genetic aspects of GC to obtain new diagnostic and prognostic markers during tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, the expression levels of DKK3 and miR-125a were decreased and increased, respectively, in metastatic GC samples compared with nonmetastatic GC samples. In fact, increasing evidence has shown that the expression level of DKK3 is decreased in several human solid cancers, including prostate, colon, and breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, it has also been reported that miR-125a is a prognostic indicator in patients with GC based on its lower expression level in GC tissues and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, our data were completely consistent with data from previous studies. Then, the metastatic functions of DKK3 and miR-125a were further explored by a scratch wound healing assay and Transwell assay. These results revealed that a lower DKK3 expression level enhanced the migratory and invasive abilities of GC cells, whereas a lower miR-125a expression level suppressed the migratory and invasive abilities of GC cells. Metastasis is closely associated with a poor prognosis of GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, migration and invasion are both important events during the process of tumour metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the integrated activity of DKK3 and miR-125a participates in the modulation of GC cell metastasis. Furthermore, according to their opposite expression patterns, we hypothesized that there might be a targeted regulatory interaction between DKK3 and miR-125a. The dual luciferase reporter assay verified our assumption.</p><p id="Par42">For most patients with advanced GC, a poor prognosis is predominantly attributed to tumour metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, not only for GC but also for most cancers, tumour metastasis is a substantial challenge for treating cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of many metastasis-related genes in GC cells treated with DKK3 and miR-125a. First, the cadherin superfamily, which is a class of homophilic adhesion molecules with important functions in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, tissue morphogenesis, and cancer, encompasses more than 100 members in humans, including classic cadherins, numerous proto-cadherins and cadherin&#x02011;related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Numerous studies have indicated that E-cadherin and N-cadherin are key components of cell&#x02013;cell junctions in epithelial monolayers and are implicated in the growth and invasion of tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Second, vimentin, which is a major constituent of the intermediate filament family of proteins that maintains cellular integrity and provides resistance against stress, has been shown to accelerate tumour growth and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Third, MMPs, especially MMP2 and MMP9, that degrade constituents of the extracellular matrix to disrupt the physiological barrier were found to participate in tumour metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, MMP2 and MMP9 were identified as attractive cancer targets that all play important roles in the context of tumour metastasis. Furthermore, our results showed that, except for E-cadherin, the expression levels of N-cadherin, Vimentin, MMP2 and MMP9 were consistently decreased in the DKK3 and miR-125a inhibitor groups compared to their corresponding control groups and were markedly increased in the DKK3 shRNA and miR-125a groups compared to their corresponding control groups. These results further confirmed that DKK3 and miR-125a alter the tumour metastasis process by regulating metastasis-related molecules.</p><p id="Par43">Ultimately, overexpression of E2F3, which is an oncogene in tumorigenesis, is associated with a poor prognosis in a variety of human malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A study of 976 patients with GC indicated that a high expression level of E2F3 is correlated with a poor prognosis compared with a low expression level of E2F3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Disruptive expression of DKK3 in cancers has been verified in some cancer types, including pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and downregulated expression of DKK3 has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, in other types of cancer, such as gastric cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer, upregulated DKK3 mRNA expression has been found. In GC, patients with a high expression level of DKK3 have a lower overall survival (OS) rate than those with a low expression level of DKK3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, it was shown that the expression level of E2F3 was markedly increased in metastatic GC samples and GC cell lines, indicating the tumour activator role of E2F3. Additionally, through a more in-depth understanding of E2F3, it was revealed that there are intricate networks between E2F3 and miRNAs in regulating the occurrence, development and progression of tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, the relationship between E2F3 and miR-125a was examined by a ChIP assay and analysis of Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves. In addition, the regulatory effects of E2F3 on the downstream gene DKK3 of miR-125a were also determined by WB. The result precisely indicated that E2F3 mediates DKK3 by targeting miR-125a.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">Overall, the present study revealed that the expression of DKK3 was frequently downregulated in metastatic GC compared with nonmetastatic GC, but the expression of miR-125a and E2F2 was typically upregulated in metastatic GC. Changes in DKK3 and miR-125a expression were closely associated with tumour metastasis in the progression of GC. Furthermore, E2F3, which is an upstream regulatory molecule, directly targets the miR-125a promoter and further mediates the miR-125a-targeted gene DKK3. Therefore, our findings indicated that E2F3, miR-125a and DKK3 might compose a linear regulatory axis and might be novel targets for GC therapy.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>GC</term><def><p id="Par5">gastric cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hp</term><def><p id="Par6">
