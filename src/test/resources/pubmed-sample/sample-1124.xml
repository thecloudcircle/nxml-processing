Extensive efforts have been made to discover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, as the early symptoms of NSCLC are not obvious, a large portion of NSCLC patients was diagnosed at late stages, with high malignancy and low treatment opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The current overall 5-year survival rate of NSCLC patients still remains unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this study, we focused to understand the pathogenesis of NSCLC, as well as to investigate new therapeutic targets based on the tumorigenesis of NSCLC.</p><p id="Par15">Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs, &#x0003e;&#x02009;200&#x02009;nt) are a major subtype of non-coding RNAs that cannot translate to proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A large number of lncRNAs have been discovered to play vital roles in tumorigenesis, with an unignorable impact in many biological procedures such as cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell death, as well as tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previous studies have revealed the expression profiles of several lncRNAs that participate closely in the tumorigenesis of NSCLC, including lncRNA PVT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], MEG3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and so on. LncRNA LINC01503 is a super-enhancer-driven lncRNA that is dysregulated in several types of human cancer. For example, it was reported that lncRNA LINC01503, regulated by TP63, is over-expressed and oncogenic in squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, its role in NSCLC remains unknown.</p><p id="Par16">As another major subtype of non-coding RNA, microRNAs (miRNAs, ~&#x02009;20&#x02009;nt) exert tumor-suppressive functions in many types of human cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For NSCLC, miRNAs are usually working together with specific lncRNAs and down-stream factors to regulate their progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MiR-342-3p was reported to target RAP2B to suppress proliferation and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One report revealed that miR-342-3p suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) in human cervical cancer. In our preliminary experiments, Starbase predicted that lncRNA LINC01503 could target miR-342-3p. LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) is a potential negative predictor of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has been proved to be the down-stream factor of miR-203 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and miR-29a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in the suppression or proliferation of human NSCLC.

Studies have demonstrated that LASP-1 was notably upregulated and promoted tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis in multiple malignant tumors, including NSCLC. LASP-1 was reported to be regulated by miR-203 and facilitate tumor proliferation and aggressiveness in human NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. LASP-1 was also reported to promote the malignant phenotype of NSCLC via inducing phosphorylation of the FAK-AKT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Moreover, miR-342-3p can directly binding to LASP1. MiR-342-3p mimic reduced cell proliferation compared with the control group in cells and this effect was attenuated by co-transfection with pcDNA-LASP1. PcDNA-LASP1 can also reverse the migration and invasion abilities of miR-342-3p mimic, suggesting that LASP1 and miR-342-3p play opposite roles in NSCLC progression. As far as we know, we are the first to report that the miR-342-3p/LASP1 axis mediated proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro.
