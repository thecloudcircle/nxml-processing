lymphomas and myeloma; they affect all age groups, but are common in older people.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Collectively, these diseases represent around 8% of all new cancers diagnosed
annually in the United Kingdom (UK).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> They can be highly aggressive or indolent, with treatment varying in
intensity and being given for differing purposes.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> For example, chemotherapy may be administered as a course (i.e. with a
specific number of cycles); it can be given intermittently (e.g. at times of
relapse/progressive disease), or constantly (e.g. daily without a planned end date);
and it can be given to induce and maintain remission, for disease control, or to
improve quality of life.</p><p>Despite significant treatment advances, many haematological malignancies remain
incurable, have unpredictable and uncertain trajectories, and highly variable
outcomes that are particularly poor for some subtypes.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr6-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Deterioration may be unexpected
and sudden or gradual, as response to chemotherapy diminishes. This can complicate
decision-making regarding treatment cessation, initiation of end-of-life discussions
and ascertainment of care preferences.</p><p>End-of-life pathways are recognised to differ for patients with haematological
malignancies from other cancers. People with blood cancers, in the United Kingdom
and elsewhere, are more likely to receive hospital-based intensive treatments close
to the end of life;<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
less likely to receive palliative and/or hospice care,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> or to receive this closer to
death, when they are seriously ill;<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and more likely to die in
hospital than at home or in a hospice.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr15-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Studies indicate that most people would prefer to die at home<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and that their
family caregivers often support this decision.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, such assertions are increasingly being questioned. A recent
systematic review of the UK literature, for example, highlights the scale and impact
of missing data in studies about place of death and the resulting lack of clarity
around preference for home death.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Another study, based on interviews with 59 bereaved family carers of older
people dying at home, revealed the complex and often overpowering emotions that may
be associated with home death, which led the authors to question if this setting is
necessarily better than the others.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Other interviews, exploring end-of-life hospital use by patients with
palliative care needs, found that beyond treatment patients also appreciated being
cared for by staff with expert knowledge of their condition, as this made them feel
&#x02018;safe&#x02019; and brought relief for family members.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Symptom outcomes are also said to be better for individuals dying in
hospital, compared to home.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>To date, little is known about preferred place of care and death in patients with
haematological cancers and their families. We therefore conducted interviews with
bereaved relatives of patients with these diseases, one strand of a larger
qualitative study that included interviews with haematology doctors and nurses, GPs
and palliative care clinicians.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The aim of the interviews with
relatives was to explore (1) preferred place of care and death; (2) reflections on
experiences following the patient&#x02019;s death, including perceptions of factors
influencing the attainment of preferences; and (3) changes that could promote
achievement of preferences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section8-0269216318824525"><title>Methods</title><p>We used qualitative methods (in-depth interviews), described below in accordance with
the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ).<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><sec id="section9-0269216318824525"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The study was set within the United Kingdom&#x02019;s Haematology Malignancy Research
Network (HMRN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hmrn.org">www.hmrn.org</ext-link>), a collaborative programme of work involving
researchers and clinical staff, which was established in 2004 to generate
evidence to improve patient care,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> using various methodologies, including qualitative research. For the
present project, haematologists at a single hospital in the HMRN area
purposively identified the main bereaved family care provider(s) of patients
with leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma, who had died within the previous 2&#x02009;years
(maximum). Potential interviewees were then sent an information sheet about the
study and an invitation to take part. Inclusion was not limited by place of
death or end-of-life preferences and whether these had been met.</p><p>Individuals who wanted to take part were asked to contact a researcher (D.A.H.)
to arrange an interview. In total, 13 relatives were approached and 10 agreed to
be interviewed (<xref rid="table1-0269216318824525" ref-type="table">Table

the sensitive nature of the topic, we did not want to conduct more interviews
than necessary, nor did we wish to overburden the haematologists facilitating
recruitment. Data saturation (when no new or relevant information is forthcoming<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>) was, therefore, deemed unlikely and so was not an aim of the study.</p><table-wrap id="table1-0269216318824525" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Characteristics of relative participants and decedents.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269216318824525-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Study ID</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Participant characteristics</th><th align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Decedent characteristics</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Months between patient&#x02019;s death and

epistemological, philosophical or theoretical stance, but adaptable to various
qualitative approaches aiming to generate themes. It facilitates the
identification of commonalities and differences in qualitative data, focusing on

was guided by the research questions, derived from the relevant literature. It
followed the systematic sequential steps: data familiarisation (by reading and
re-reading transcripts); identification of codes and development of a coding
scheme that was applied to individual transcripts, expanded and modified as
necessary to accommodate data; aggregation of codes (units of meaning) and theme
development; summarising and charting of data (using electronic spreadsheets to

home care and death, which remained unchanged as the patient&#x02019;s condition
declined. Death anywhere but home was considered highly undesirable by these
interviewees, who portrayed themselves as advocates, prepared to &#x02018;speak up&#x02019; to
ensure patients died at home:<disp-quote><p>he wanted to stay at home &#x02026; I wasn&#x02019;t going to have him go in [to
hospital] because he didn&#x02019;t want to &#x02026; the night he was dying he was
getting restless and I said &#x02018;will you let me get the doctor &#x02026;&#x02019;, &#x02018;No, no,
they&#x02019;ll take me [to hospital] &#x02026;&#x02019; and I said &#x02018;no, they won&#x02019;t &#x02026;&#x02019; I
wouldn&#x02019;t have let him go back in &#x02026; (R7)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Hospice was cited as the &#x02018;fall back&#x02019; option for some people whose first
preference was for death at home. One relative (R1) said she had wanted her
husband to die in hospice to avoid future painful associations of him having
died in the family home:<disp-quote><p>she was very clear that she wanted to die at home, and if she couldn&#x02019;t,
then it would have been in the hospice if at all possible, she
absolutely did not want to be in hospital. (R9)</p><p>I didn&#x02019;t want him to die at home &#x02026; it would have brought too many
memories &#x02026; I would have been quite happy for him to go into hospice.
(R1)</p></disp-quote></p><p>R5&#x02019;s husband had expressed a preference for hospice care, though her own
inclination had been for him to die at home. However, when her husband developed
distressing symptoms, he was urgently admitted to hospital, where he died:<disp-quote><p>he wanted the final chapter of his life to be in the hospice &#x02026; he didn&#x02019;t
want to die in hospital &#x02026; but he was coughing up blood and couldn&#x02019;t get
his breath. (R5)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Only one participant (R4) indicated having held a preference for her spouse to
receive end-of-life care in hospital, due to anxiety about her ability to
provide adequate care at home. Her preference was for her husband to receive
professional support in a nearby hospital, where she could visit without
restriction. Reflecting on his death, this interviewee noted the high-quality
care her husband had received during his final weeks, which had convinced her
that death in hospital had been appropriate:<disp-quote><p>the hospital was half a mile away &#x02026; I could be there in five minutes &#x02026;
they made us feel totally involved and welcomed &#x02026; the staff nurses and
nursing assistants were wonderful &#x02026; For us hospital was the right place,
if we&#x02019;d been at home we would have been stressed &#x02026; that we weren&#x02019;t doing
the right thing &#x02026; I was very grateful for that professional support &#x02026; he
was needing two people to help him go to the loo &#x02026; he was very weak &#x02026; I
don&#x02019;t know how I could have managed at home without someone with me.
(R4)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Similarly, several relatives (R1, R5, R10), whose spouses had not wished to die
in hospital but had done so, stated that with hindsight they had come to view
the patient&#x02019;s death in hospital as appropriate and acceptable, partly because
(re)admission had brought expert nursing care and symptom relief. These
relatives suggested that they would have struggled to care for the patient at
home, particularly overnight, when assistance from community nurses could be
unreliable. However, a sense of failure associated with relinquishing
responsibility for caring for their spouse was apparent in some accounts:<disp-quote><p>I felt I&#x02019;d failed him in some way with him having to go back in [to
hospital], but I know he was really frightened when he couldn&#x02019;t take his
breath during the night &#x02026; and he felt a lot safer on the ward where he
could get help incredibly quickly &#x02026; the support we got couldn&#x02019;t have
been better &#x02026; in the end it was the right place. (R5)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Place of death was reported as less significant to some patients in their final
hours than feeling safe and secure in a familiar environment, cared for by
people they knew and trusted. One relative (R1), whose husband had wanted to die
at home, described his death in a small community hospital as &#x02018;very peaceful&#x02019;:<disp-quote><p>those last 48 hours, I don&#x02019;t think he really cared [where he was] &#x02026; there
was something about [hospital] that made it more user friendly &#x02026; it was
small, it was more intimate &#x02026; it was less clinical and he liked the
staff &#x02026; he didn&#x02019;t like a big [hospital]. (R1)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Contrastingly, enabling home death appeared vitally important to relatives for
whom dying at home was intrinsic to their notion of a &#x02018;good death&#x02019;. R2, for
example, expressed a desire to &#x02018;give&#x02019; her mother a good death at home. As a
nurse, she said she had felt competent to manage her mother&#x02019;s symptoms and needs
at home, with support from family and community nursing services. This relative
recounted positive memories of her mother&#x02019;s &#x02018;lovely&#x02019; death, which she felt had
drawn family members together:<disp-quote><p>she [mother] had a good death at home &#x02026; it was lovely &#x02026; even when she was
breathing her last we were ringing this friend of hers saying &#x02018;do you
want to come round and say goodbye&#x02019;. (R2)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section14-0269216318824525"><title>Theme 2: factors perceived to influence achievement of preferred place of

unpredictability of the patient&#x02019;s disease. Sudden deterioration, alongside
the onset of distressing symptoms, resulted in relatives contacting
haematology services, the General Practitioner (GP) or out-of-hours medical
services, for advice and assistance. Consequently, some patients previously
discharged home to die were readmitted to hospital, where they subsequently
died. Such events were said to have occurred even when there was input from
community palliative care nurses:<disp-quote><p>with this kind of illness, events overtake themselves, they
[patients] have a downturn and they need immediate attention and
your first port of call is the hospital &#x02026; they have this raging
temperature and they need immediate medical assistance &#x02026; antibiotics
and blood transfusions, fluids, so you ring the helpline and they
get you in. (R1)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Sudden decline in the patient&#x02019;s condition could mean that discharge home, or
hospice transfer (from hospital), was not always desirable or feasible at
this time:<disp-quote><p>it would have been really cruel to move him when he suddenly went
downhill that quickly &#x02026; he was far better supported by people who
really knew him instead of him having to travel [to hospice] when he
was feeling terrible &#x02026; to a situation where we didn&#x02019;t know anybody.
(R5)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section16-0269216318824525"><title>Occurrence and timing of discussions about treatment cessation, prognosis
and place of care and death</title><p>The occurrence and early introduction of end-of-life discussions appeared
important for meeting preferences for home death, particularly if
care-packages required organising to facilitate this. Most relatives
recalled at least one discussion with a haematologist concerning treatment
cessation in the months/weeks preceding the patient&#x02019;s death; they recalled
being told that there was &#x02018;nothing more to be done&#x02019; in terms of treatment
and that they had &#x02018;run out&#x02019; of options. Some people commented that it had
been clearly explained at diagnosis that the effectiveness of treatment
would diminish over time, a message reinforced in follow-up consultations:<disp-quote><p>when the cancer originally happened [haematologist] gave a percentage
&#x02026; [chance of] cure &#x02026; and then when [patient] went back &#x02026; it was
definitely not such a good recovery rate &#x02026; [Haematologist] did tell
us that before [patient] even started the chemo &#x02026; so my husband knew
that his chances were much worse. (R6)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Others said that they had experienced feelings of shock as, at diagnosis,
they believed that they had been told the patient&#x02019;s condition, although not
curable, was treatable. This had led some relatives and patients to remain
predominantly optimistic that a new treatment might stop their disease progressing:<disp-quote><p>[Haematologist] told us it wasn&#x02019;t curable but it was treatable, it
just always made us feel hopeful that they would treat it &#x02026;
[Haematologist] was so good at trying everything and anything.
(R8)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In other cases, it was only after the patient&#x02019;s (re)admission to hospital due
to deterioration that discussions indicated treatment was failing and the
patient was going to die imminently:<disp-quote><p>we got into the hospital, and then it was made clear &#x02026; and we began
to understand where we were going. (R3)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In such cases, relatives recalled being asked about preferred place of care
and death, but described patients as being too ill to make considered
decisions at this juncture. Moreover, options were limited if, for example,
a hospice bed was required for terminal care, but not immediately available:<disp-quote><p>there wasn&#x02019;t a hospice bed available. (R5)</p></disp-quote></p><p>One person had attended a multidisciplinary meeting to discuss her spouse&#x02019;s
preferences, but found the experience intimidating and overwhelming:<disp-quote><p>I found it incredibly daunting &#x02026; you&#x02019;re going as a relative stranger
into a room full of people, who all know each other and &#x02026; everybody
is coming at it from all their different points of view &#x02026; I just
felt utterly bombarded and overwhelmed &#x02026; it was horrible &#x02026; I felt
trapped &#x02026; inside you&#x02019;re screaming. (R5)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Another relative said that they would have appreciated earlier discussion
concerning decreasing response to treatment and likelihood of death. Yet,
despite attempts by haematologists, relatives portrayed most patients as
reluctant to engage in end-of-life conversations, either with clinicians or
with their family:<disp-quote><p>the earlier you discuss it, the better, frankly &#x02026; when she firstly
was told at the hospital of a 20% chance of survival, at that point,
somebody ought to have come and had a discussion with her. (R9)</p><p>[Haematologist] was upfront &#x02026; but he [patient] didn&#x02019;t want to know.
(R7)</p><p>He [patient] wouldn&#x02019;t discuss it &#x02026; he was frightened of dying &#x02026; he
was never good at dealing with anything emotive &#x02026; he couldn&#x02019;t come
to terms with it. (R1)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Relatives described how late discussions resulted in patients returning home
from hospital at short notice, with little time to organise support from
relatives and/or community nursing services:<disp-quote><p>the consultant said &#x02026; there was really no more [he/she] could do and
[he/she] came into the [hospital] room and told him that &#x02026; They did
ask him where he wanted to go and he said, &#x02018;I&#x02019;d like to go home&#x02019; and
there was a meeting between the GP surgery and various staff to try
and have that happen &#x02026; I was quite frightened at the thought of him
coming home &#x02026; because they [community nursing services] couldn&#x02019;t
promise any night care. (R10)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Doctors were said to be reluctant to predict prognosis after treatment
cessation, and several relatives had been shocked and unprepared for how
quickly death had ensued following hospital discharge:<disp-quote><p>they never said time is short &#x02026; there was no weeks or months &#x02026; they
didn&#x02019;t give us a time-span &#x02026; and I wasn&#x02019;t ready [for parent&#x02019;s
death]. (R2)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Relatives focussed on aspects of haematologists&#x02019; communication skills that
had made end-of-life discussions easier or more difficult. An open, honest
approach, with sufficient time for dialogue, was described positively, while
an &#x02018;abrupt&#x02019; attitude was perceived as disengaging:<disp-quote><p>we had every confidence in [haematologist, who] was excellent and
explained everything beautifully. (R6)</p><p>it was abrupt &#x02026; a bit full on for him [patient] &#x02026; in your face &#x02026; we&#x02019;d
only been in [the room] a minute or two and [the haematologist] just
looked at him and said &#x02018;Do you know where you want to die?&#x02019;.
(R1)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section17-0269216318824525"><title>Family networks</title><p>Having relatives at home, or nearby, who could provide physical care and
emotional support was considered essential for patients to remain at home.
Some interviewees described themselves as too frail for this, while others
were disinclined to carry out intimate tasks, seen as undignified for the
patient, preferring instead to pay for assistance. Relatives experienced in
delivering &#x02018;hands-on&#x02019; nursing care said that they had felt confident in
looking after the patient at home:<disp-quote><p>I&#x02019;m not very big &#x02026; I was just terrified that he would fall because I
thought, if he falls, I&#x02019;ll never get him up by myself. (R8)</p><p>having to change him, he was very embarrassed &#x02026; you&#x02019;ve got to think
of the person&#x02019;s dignity. (R10)</p><p>[paid carers] helped with bed bath and cleaned and tidied [patient].
(R3)</p><p>I was a carer &#x02026; we did the course at college for palliative care &#x02026;
I&#x02019;d been nursing for a long time &#x02026; in the community. (R7)</p></disp-quote></p><p>The benefits of the wider family &#x02018;pulling together&#x02019; to support the patient to
remain at home were noted by many respondents: &#x02018;family cohesion &#x02026; the whole
family worked at it&#x02019; (R3). Relatives who advocated for patients to remain at
home at the end of their lives, if this was their choice, rather than being
(re)admitted to hospital (see Theme 1), said that they did not feel their
views were always given due consideration by the community health care team.
Those with prior knowledge or experience of community nursing or hospice
services remarked that this had helped them access services on behalf of
patients. Others (e.g. R3 and daughter), who described themselves as
&#x02018;complete amateurs in a professional world&#x02019;, relied on health care
professionals to inform them about services:<disp-quote><p>I know how the system works &#x02026; we got her fast tracked, equipment
appeared &#x02026; we got the Marie Curie nurse to stay on an evening and &#x02026;
I put a bit of emphasis on getting the Macmillan [nurse] on board &#x02026;
and she said, let&#x02019;s take you to the day hospice, I&#x02019;d like you to
meet the consultant in palliative care &#x02026; and everything was sorted
out. (R2; community nurse)</p><p>he was not offered any chance to go into hospice &#x02026; it would have been
nice to have had the option &#x02026; (R10)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Having prior contact with outpatient hospice services seemed influential in
consideration of inpatient hospice care; but policy regarding the delivery
of supportive care in this setting and the potential for this to vary
between sites was said to restrict some patients accessing this resource:<disp-quote><p>we managed to get my mum to the day hospice, which she really enjoyed
&#x02026; and she agreed to admission to the hospice as well. (R2)</p><p>if his calcium had shot up and he needed more treatment, [hospice]
wouldn&#x02019;t have done it, they would have sent him back to hospital.
(R6)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Several relatives mentioned feeling &#x02018;let down&#x02019; by the lack of support for
themselves as caregivers; only one person reported receiving written
information to prepare them for what to expect at the time of their
relative&#x02019;s death:<disp-quote><p>some [nurses] are very good but some are not up to palliative care,
&#x02018;cos you&#x02019;re not just there for the patient, you&#x02019;re there for the
relative as well. (R7)</p><p>I didn&#x02019;t know what happens when people die &#x02026; but the Marie Curie
nurse left a little booklet &#x02026; that was very, very helpful. (R6)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section18-0269216318824525"><title>Resource availability</title><p>Adequate nursing support (e.g. district, Macmillan and Marie Curie nurses)
was considered essential for relatives to provide care at home, and &#x02018;gaps&#x02019;,
particularly overnight, were described as detrimental to relatives&#x02019; capacity
to cope:<disp-quote><p>[home care] was never feasible unless we had much more support than
we had, we&#x02019;d have to have [had] almost full time support. (R4)</p><p>you&#x02019;d have a job to get a nurse overnight. (R7)</p></disp-quote></p><p>GP involvement was also regarded as important. GPs who had been informed
about the patient&#x02019;s condition were said to have offered practical and
emotional support to patients and relatives. However, the role of GPs could
be constrained by poor or delayed communication with haematology staff:<disp-quote><p>[GP] came and said, &#x02018;well, I think we&#x02019;ve reached the end of the road
now &#x02026;&#x02019; I knew the hospital kept him informed while [patient] was
seeing [haematologist] and [GP] said, &#x02018;I can arrange for you to go
into hospice, or if you&#x02019;d rather stay at home, the choice is up to
you&#x02019;, and I said, &#x02018;oh, he&#x02019;ll stay at home please, if I can have some
help to look after him&#x02019;, and he said, &#x02018;yes, I&#x02019;ll arrange that for
you&#x02019;. (R8)</p><p>they don&#x02019;t communicate with the GP surgeries, these specialist
[haematology] centres. (R2)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Planning for, and timing of, hospital discharge was said to have a
significant impact on resource availability and home death experiences.
Advance planning, early involvement of hospital palliative care staff and
timely liaison between service providers were linked with positive experiences:<disp-quote><p>the hospital got in touch with Macmillan &#x02026; When [haematologist]
stopped treatment [he/she] wrote to our GP and [GP] took charge &#x02026;
and told us what was available &#x02026; We had a social worker come [who]
got the care support forms going &#x02026; carers coming in &#x02026; we had Marie
Curie come. (R3)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Contrastingly, relatives of patients discharged from hospital at short
notice, when they were very close to death, reported insufficient time to
organise support before the patient&#x02019;s death; in some cases, patients did not
survive long enough after treatment cessation to be discharged home. Access
to hospice beds at short notice was also regarded as problematic:<disp-quote><p>they sent him home &#x02026; and he died [next day] &#x02026; [community support]
should be sorted before [he] came home from the hospital. (R7)</p><p>there was a meeting between the GP surgery and various staff at the
hospital to try and have that [hospital discharge] happen &#x02026; but
unfortunately [patient] didn&#x02019;t reach that stage &#x02026; (R10)</p><p>all these hospices are chock-a-block full, always. (R6)</p></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec id="section19-0269216318824525"><title>Theme 3: suggested changes to facilitate care and death in the preferred
place</title><p>Participants proposed various changes to promote attainment of preferences. Early
discussions of treatment cessation, prognosis and preferences were frequently mentioned:<disp-quote><p>it would have been a really good idea for someone to have [discussed
prognosis] with her at a much earlier stage &#x02026; it didn&#x02019;t really happen at
all. (R9)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Having adequate community support (nursing services, reliable round-the-clock
help; GP involvement), for both patients and carers, was also considered
essential if relatives were to cope satisfactorily at home and home death was to
be achieved:<disp-quote><p>[the] Macmillan nurse was a gem &#x02026; just telling us how to go about things
&#x02026; Marie Curie came to us about 4 times. (R3)</p><p>they could promise day care, but they couldn&#x02019;t promise night care &#x02026;
(R10)</p><p>he collapsed in the bathroom and I just couldn&#x02019;t lift him. (R1)</p><p>[the GP] got on to the district nurses &#x02026; and he got a hospital bed &#x02026; and
hospice at home to help me. (R8)</p><p>the GP went out and did it [administered medication] at all hours &#x02026; it
was amazing &#x02026; and just looked after the family. (R2)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Improved communication and co-ordination of services across secondary and primary
care, as well as third sector organisations (e.g. hospice), was also considered
important in ensuring that appropriate support was available:<disp-quote><p>if they want people to die at home &#x02026; they need to get it together &#x02026; I
think that&#x02019;s a big let-down, the communication between the hospital and
the system outside. (R7)</p><p>no-one told me that he could have treatment at the hospice &#x02026; I am sure we
would have opted for hospice had we known that. (R10)</p><p>with the hospice, there needs to be a lot more interaction. (R1)</p></disp-quote></p><p>The final issue reported related to clinicians giving greater weight to
relatives&#x02019; views on preventing hospital (re)admission of patients discharged
home to die:<disp-quote><p>there was a real problem &#x02026; with the out-of-hours service not
understanding &#x02026; and not being willing to listen &#x02026; I accept that [the
GP&#x02019;s] first reaction might be yes, let&#x02019;s get her into hospital, but [GP]
should have stopped and listened &#x02026; she died five days later at home.

complex, interrelated factors, some amenable to change, others less so. Factors
included the disease characteristics (e.g. the potential for sudden
deterioration and death), occurrence and timing of discussions (e.g. treatment
cessation, prognosis, place of care and death), family networks (e.g. the
willingness/ability of relatives to provide care, their awareness of services
and confidence to advocate on the patient&#x02019;s behalf) and resource availability
(e.g. clinical carers, hospice beds/policies). On reflection, some relatives
considered hospital the &#x02018;right&#x02019; place for the patient to have died. Others had
shared strong preferences with patients for home death and acted to ensure this
occurred. No patients died in a hospice, and a range of barriers were identified
to this, notably lack of awareness about this facility, but also variation in
service provision.</p></sec><sec id="section22-0269216318824525"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine preferred place of care and
death in patients with blood cancers from the perspective of bereaved relatives.
Qualitative methods suit the exploration of phenomena about which little is known<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and purposeful sampling facilitated the selection of &#x02018;key informants&#x02019; who
could provide rich description. Use of semi-structured interviews enabled
relatives to focus on issues they considered significant. Our study sample,
though comparatively small, is not atypical in qualitative research.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Determining the ideal number of participants is dependent on various
factors, including the quality of information obtained from
interviewees.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Participants in this study were the main care providers, so
were inevitably well informed and able to relate rich, detailed data, which
produced new and important insights. The nature of the subject, and the
relatively short space of time between the death of their relative and the
interview, meant recall was not an issue, although the possible influence of
memory on the validity of findings cannot be completely dismissed. We recognise
that the views of our study participants may not be reflective of the
perspectives of the broader population of bereaved relatives;<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> for example, the perceptions of relatives of younger patients, and those
from minority ethnic groups, warrant further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="section23-0269216318824525"><title>What this study adds?</title><p>Our study provides new insights into end-of-life care for people with
haematological malignancies. While almost all relatives said that they had
shared patient preferences for home care/death, some indicated that they had
come to regard place of death as less important than achieving the best care for
their relative. Participants in our study who had come to regard hospital as the
&#x02018;right&#x02019; place for the patient&#x02019;s death said that this was due to the high-quality
care provided by well-known staff, in familiar surroundings, and similar
findings have been reported by others.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Although a large body of research shows that home is generally the preferred
place of death,<sup><xref rid="bibr39-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> many people do not die at home;<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> for some, this may not be feasible or desirable.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="bibr42-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr43-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Interestingly, a recent
population-based study of haematological cancer decedents found that more than
28% of those reporting a preference opted for hospital death.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In such situations, hospital may represent a &#x02018;safe haven&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Freedom from pain, having family present, not being a burden, having
treatment choices followed and the opportunity to resolve conflicts have been
ranked more highly by patients than actual place of death.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Furthermore, review evidence indicates that what matters most to family
members, regardless of the setting, is a good formal care team, who provide
holistic &#x02018;round-the-clock&#x02019; assistance, keep relatives informed and acknowledge
the significance of the informal carer&#x02019;s role.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding factors impacting on achievement of preferences, disease
characteristics were important, with unpredictable pathways constraining or
shaping choices, decisions and outcomes. Sudden, unanticipated deterioration was
linked to increased likelihood of hospital death among patients having intensive
hospital-based therapy, or receiving care at home. Relatives said that they
would have welcomed guidance about the possibility of rapid change, as well as
the signs of impending death. This issue has been highlighted by other authors,<sup><xref rid="bibr48-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> along with the difficulty of living in a state of permanent uncertainty
about the way in which their relative&#x02019;s disease might progress and the moment of death.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>Preoccupation with &#x02018;doing the right thing&#x02019; when providing home care was
widespread among our interviewees and was linked to feelings of stress and
inadequacy. Other authors have described the &#x02018;psychological complexity&#x02019;<sup><xref rid="bibr50-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> relatives report as inherent in providing home care, due to high levels
of responsibility, isolation and anxiety, as well as emotions such as anger,
fear, frustration and sadness.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>Relatives in our study reported receiving varying levels of support from other
family members and health professionals; those whose expectations for support
had apparently not been met appeared to harbour enduring feelings of
disappointment. Literature suggests that family home carers are sometimes viewed
as a &#x02018;co-workers&#x02019; by health care professionals and may not be identified as
having their own needs; they may also be elderly, frail or ill themselves,
requiring professionals to &#x02018;think family&#x02019; when assessing their support
needs.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="bibr51-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>The occurrence and timing of end-of-life discussions was significant. A
widespread preference was stated for such conversations to occur early and for
them to be open, honest and frank. Accounts of undue optimism about treatment
outcomes among patients, relatives and haematologists may be due to previous
success with multiple lines of therapy and overly optimistic interpretation of
communications with clinicians.<sup><xref rid="bibr52-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Although maintaining some degree of hope, while remaining realistic, is a
difficult balance,<sup><xref rid="bibr53-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="bibr54-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> our findings underscore the need for clinicians to guard
against raising false expectations.</p><p>There is growing consensus about the need for timely discussions<sup><xref rid="bibr55-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> and early shifts in treatment goals towards a palliative approach to care
(including primary care involvement), as the likelihood of response or cure
diminishes.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="bibr57-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Prognostication is notoriously difficult in haematology,<sup><xref rid="bibr58-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> however, which complicates clinician decisions regarding the &#x02018;best&#x02019; time
to initiate advance planning. Moreover, relatives in our study often highlighted
patients&#x02019; reluctance to talk about death and dying, a finding that accords with
studies showing that anxiety in such situations may trigger denial or avoidance
behaviour.<sup><xref rid="bibr59-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="bibr60-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Reasons cited in the wider literature to explain
haematologists&#x02019; delays in initiating conversations include the possibility of
response to new treatments, time constraints, lack of confidence in
communicating &#x02018;bad news&#x02019; and disinclination to &#x02018;abandon&#x02019; patients after
prolonged treatments.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="bibr62-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Encouraging uptake of communication skills training among
clinical staff could be one means of promoting supportive, honest conversations
and increasing patient and clinician satisfaction.<sup><xref rid="bibr63-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup></p><p>Relatives viewed the wider family network and dependable access to resources,
including specialist palliative care and &#x02018;round-the-clock&#x02019; community nursing
services, as crucial to supporting patients to die at home. This matches
findings from a recent systematic review<sup><xref rid="bibr62-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> and reportedly results in home death becoming a more realistic
option.<sup><xref rid="bibr64-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">64</xref><xref rid="bibr65-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr66-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> GP
involvement was seen as facilitative of home death, due to the multifaceted role
these clinicians exert within primary care. The need for more effective
communication systems across the primary/secondary care interface was also
identified, along with greater acknowledgement of caregivers&#x02019; feelings and
preferences, which may also promote their recovery from grief.<sup><xref rid="bibr67-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup></p><p>Hospice services were not accessed by the majority of our interviewees and
factors said to influence this (unavailability of urgent or routine beds/
access, policies for administrating supportive treatments and prior family
knowledge/contact) are reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr68-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> A recent US study<sup><xref rid="bibr69-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> concludes that patients would benefit from closer collaboration between
haematology and palliative care doctors and hospice access. Increased
collaboration has been noted in the United Kingdom, alongside the need for
clearer role definition, and consistent, flexible service provision.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr61-0269216318824525" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup></p><p>Issues requiring further research identified in our own and other studies include
