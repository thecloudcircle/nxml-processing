Cardiac perforation can also occur several days or even months after implantation.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> In our cohort, more than 80% of the patients had subacute and delayed perforations. Cardiac perforations tend to be more prevalent in active&#x02010;fixation leads because the helical screwing mechanism is prone to penetration through the myocardium. In some case series, all culprit leads were reported to be active&#x02010;fixation leads.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> However, in the present study, of the 53 perforated leads, nearly 30% were passive&#x02010;fixation leads. Furthermore, a recent population&#x02010;based cohort study performed in Taiwan reported no difference in the risk of cardiac perforation between active&#x02010; and passive&#x02010;fixation pacing leads.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Given that the atrial myocardium is thinner than the ventricular myocardium, it is easy to speculate that atrium perforation is more frequent than ventricle perforation, which has indeed been confirmed by previous studies.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>
</p><p>Clinical presentations of lead perforation may vary widely, from totally asymptomatic to sudden cardiac death. Symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and muscle stimulation are important clues to an accurate diagnosis. Abnormal sense or pacing parameters may also indicate lead perforation. However, symptoms may vary widely, and asymptomatic cardiac perforations are not uncommon.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Moreover, normal parameters do not exclude a perforation. A small perforation may result in the cathode being proximal to the epicardium and the anode proximal to or within the endocardium, resulting in pacemaker function within the normal range. Because visualization of the lead tip is the key component of the diagnosis of cardiac perforation, imaging tests such as chest radiography and echocardiography have more accuracy. Chest CT is currently considered the most sensitive for diagnosis.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="clc23327-sec-0023"><label>4.2</label><title>Management strategy</title><p>The optimal treatment of lead perforation is still a matter of debate. The prevailing question in the management of myocardial perforation is whether to remove the lead and, if yes, to remove it percutaneously or surgically. According to the 2017 HRS expert consensus statement, lead extraction should be considered if lead perforation causes pain, pericardial bleeding, other significant symptoms, or device malfunction.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> However, in asymptomatic lead perforations with normal lead function, whether to extract it remains controversial. Previous studies indicate that extraction of a perforated lead that is otherwise functioning well and causes no symptoms does not appear to be necessary, especially for a chronically implanted lead.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> These patients are always diagnosed incidentally by imaging examination, and most cases do not result in electrophysiologic consequences. Expectant management should be the first choice. It is also suggested that, for an asymptomatic perforated lead with lead malfunction, electronic programming should also be considered prior to risky lead revision. Henrikson et al reported an asymptomatic atrial lead perforation with poor sensing and pacing parameters in a 66&#x02010;year old woman with a dual&#x02010;chamber pacemaker implanted for tachy&#x02010;brady syndrome, who was managed by reprogramming the device to VVIR mode.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Of the 67 patients referred to our center, four asymptomatic patients (6.0%) with chronic lead perforation were managed successfully by electronic programming, all of whom had dual&#x02010;chamber pacemakers. Two patients implanted for sick sinus syndrome presented with ventricular lead perforations, and one implanted for intermittent complete atrioventricular block presented with atrial lead perforation. As the culprit leads were not crucial, the devices were reprogrammed to rate responsive pacing mode with atrial pacing and sensing,atrial pacing is inhibited when there is intrinsic P waves (AAIR) and rate responsive pacing mode with ventricular pacing and sensing, ventricular pacing is inhibited when there is intrinsic QRS waves (VVIR), respectively. These patients were doing well at the latest follow&#x02010;up. The remaining case concerned ventricular lead perforation in a 56&#x02010;year&#x02010;old man with a single&#x02010;chamber pacemaker implanted for complete heart block. The lead failed to capture the ventricle at the maximum output in the tip&#x02010;to&#x02010;can configuration. After tip&#x02010;to&#x02010;ring configuration was programmed, the culprit lead was restored to normal functionality and the symptoms were relieved. Perforation may result in the cathode being distant from the epicardium while the anode is proximal to or within the endocardium. In this case, the culprit lead might become functional again via lead ring pacing, which was also confirmed by our experience. During perforated lead extraction, after the culprit lead is freed we pace from the lead tip or ring to estimate which electrode is still in contact with the heart muscle. Of the 19 nonfunctional leads, two atrial leads and 10 ventricular leads were able to capture the myocardium again. It could be speculated that if the ring electrode was available as the cathode over the long term, affected patients might have cardiac capture restored and surgery might be unnecessary. Similarly, Biffi et al reported that programmability of the sensing channel and configuration in CRT&#x02010;D should become available to repair right ventricular leads with sensing issues without reintervention.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Therefore, more intensive programmability should be engineered in CIEDs, which may infrequently mandate lead revision or pocket opening to ensure permanent normal function of devices.</p><p>However, delayed perforation is not necessarily asymptomatic or without lead malfunction. In our cohort, 10 patients (11.9%) had a perforated lead older than 1 year. All of these patients had symptoms or lead malfunction that could not be repaired by electronic programming, which might be the reason why they were transferred to us from regional hospitals. For such patients, removal of the perforated lead may be the only solution.</p><p>According to a consensus endorsed by the American Heart Association, surgical removal of the perforated leads should be the preferred strategy.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Many authors have reported cases of lead perforation managed successfully by a surgical approach.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> Alternatively, many case series (with numbers ranging from 3 to 31) suggest that the perforated lead may be safely removed percutaneously with surgical backup, consistent with our current results.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> The complete procedural success rate reported in these series was 92% to 96%, which is comparable with our reported rate. Most of the perforated leads were removed by simple extraction because the dwell time was usually not overlong. In the case of a chronically implanted target lead, advanced extraction tools may be employed.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>
</p><p>In cases of lead perforation that has migrated beyond the pericardial space or into another cavity, such as the pleura, the peritoneal cavity and visceral organs, the digestive tract, and the intercostal muscles, surgical extraction seems to be the safest option to repair the site of perforation and injury to the adjacent structures at the same time.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> However, Archontakis et al recently reported four lead perforations beyond the pericardial space (diaphragm or abdominal cavity) that were treated percutaneously without major complications.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> In our study, three patients with a lead migrating into the pleural cavity or lung tissue were managed uneventfully with a percutaneous approach. However, given the small patient cohort in these studies, no definitive conclusions could be drawn and more studies are needed.</p><p>One of the most life&#x02010;threatening complications during percutaneous extraction of the perforated lead is cardiac tamponade. In the present study, no cardiac tamponade was detected during or after the procedure, in line with previous studies.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Myocardial &#x0201c;self&#x02010;sealing&#x0201d; properties, low pressure in the right ventricle, and fibrous tissue formed at the perforating site are beneficial to hemostasis of the perforated myocardium. As we know, the atrial myocardium is thinner and consists of fewer myocytes. For this reason, atrial perforations may have less ability to spontaneously close the perforated site and are more prone to pericardial effusion during or after the procedure. In the present study, neither atrial nor ventricular perforation led to new&#x02010;onset or worsening cardiac effusion, although the number of atrial perforations was small (only six patients). However, some reports have described cardiac tamponade during or shortly after removal of the perforated leads. Laborderie et al reported one case of cardiac tamponade among 10 patients with late right ventricular perforation treated with percutaneous lead extraction by simple traction.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Huang et al reported three cases of cardiac tamponade that developed 1 to 4&#x02009;days after the percutaneous lead removal procedure.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> After prompt recognition of cardiac tamponade, all patients recovered well after urgent pericardiocentesis, with no surgical repair being necessary. Therefore, transesophageal monitoring during the procedure and echocardiographic monitoring after the procedure are strongly recommended. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy may be a risk factor for delayed cardiac tamponade.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="clc23327-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Close monitoring of the international normalized ratio level is recommended. Anticoagulant agents should be discontinued before the procedure to achieve hemostasis.</p><p>Of note, we accessed the pericardial sac prior to the extraction procedure in patients with the following: perioperative pericardial effusion, perforation of old lead (&#x0003e;5&#x02009;years) with tined electrodes (with more adhesion), and perforation beyond the pericardiac sac (a through&#x02010;and&#x02010;through perforation rather than partial perforation). Although these characteristics were assumed to be risk factors for pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade after the culprit lead was removed, no pericardial effusion was detected. Therefore, preoperative pericardial drainage without cardiac effusion or tamponade is not mandatory and should not be used as a routine approach.</p><p>Owing to the &#x0201c;high&#x02010;risk&#x0201d; nature of the operation, the whole procedure should be performed in a center specializing in percutaneous lead extraction, under careful hemodynamic and echocardiographic monitoring. Following extraction, the patient should also be closely monitored, both clinically and by echocardiography, because of the risk of pericardial perfusion relapse.</p><p>In this series of 53 patients, there were no complications and no need for any action by surgery. However, we consider that surgical backup is necessary for these cases because they might result in uncontrolled bleeding, which requires a surgical approach. When pericardial drainage is ineffective in restoring blood pressure and there is evidence of significant continued bleeding, which could happen because of differences in the size and nature of the perforation, surgery must be rapidly performed.<xref rid="clc23327-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> While surgical backup was not needed in our series, it is a critical component of these cases and is required to ensure an optimal outcome. Since urgent pericardial drainage can &#x0201c;buy&#x0201d; time until surgery, there is no need for a cardiothoracic surgeon to scrub in, although rescue thoracotomy should be performed promptly before it is too late.</p></sec><sec id="clc23327-sec-0024"><label>4.3</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The present investigation has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study at a single center. Second, the patients who were referred for surgical lead revision or managed conservatively were excluded because the aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of the percutaneous management approach. Third, the lead types were not evenly distributed because most of the perforated leads were ventricular leads and only two defibrillator leads were included.</p></sec></sec><sec id="clc23327-sec-0025"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study showed that lead perforation may occur relatively late after CIED implantation. Both active&#x02010; and passive&#x02010;fixation leads can cause perforation. Chest pain, dyspnea, or altered electrical parameters after CIED implantation must prompt a radiologic and echocardiographic evaluation. For asymptomatic patients with lead malfunction, fully electronic programming should be considered prior to deciding on surgery. When lead revision is mandatory, most patients can be managed safely and effectively by TLE. While not needed in our series, surgical backup is a critical component to ensure an optimal outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="clc23327-sec-0026"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare no potential conflict of interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="clc23327-bibl-0001" content-type="cited-references"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="clc23327-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="clc23327-cit-0001">
