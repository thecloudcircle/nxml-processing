Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) increases the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and lung cancer [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as well as exacerbating existing conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These chronic conditions are expensive to treat and put unnecessary strain on an already overworked healthcare system. Little is known about the extent of the attributable cost of these diseases to air pollution, now and into the future. Understanding the extent and magnitude of air pollution&#x02019;s impact on long-term health is important for future National Health Service (NHS) budget allocation, priority setting, and policy planning.</p><p>In light of this, and in response to the UK Parliament Environmental Audit Committee&#x02019;s conclusion [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that &#x02018;the Government must&#x02026;urgently quantify the impact on morbidity and the cost to the NHS of poor air quality&#x02019;, this study developed a modelling framework to monetise the present and future morbidity attributable to long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> from outdoor sources in terms of primary care visits, prescriptions, secondary care (inpatient and outpatient) visits, and social care. Social care is defined here as state-funded out-of-hospital care provided in the community and at a patient&#x02019;s home with the primary aim of reducing or managing the deterioration in health status for people with a degree of long-term dependency, helping them with activities of daily living, and assisting them to live independently. In estimating the health and economic burden of air pollution, we build an economic case for investing in preventative interventions.</p><p>Using a microsimulation model, the population of England was simulated, and the number of new air-pollution-related disease cases and resultant costs to the NHS and social care from exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were estimated from 2017 to 2035, as a total and separately for various conditions, while taking into account overlaps between the 2 pollutants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>The projection and microsimulation model</title><p>We used a microsimulation model to produce longitudinal projections of air-pollution-attributable NCDs and related NHS and social care costs from 2017 to 2035. The microsimulation method is a rigorous method for modelling and projecting the long-term health impacts of chronic diseases into the future. The methods applied have been described in detail before [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Study-specific adaptations to the model are described in depth in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002602.s001">S1 Text</xref>. We created a virtual population of 50 million individuals in the microsimulation. Each individual was exposed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> according to 2015 exposure data by age and sex (described in detail below). The population was distributed based on 2015 demographic characteristics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002602.s002">S2 Text</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Fifty million individuals were modelled to enhance power and detection of low-incidence diseases. All outputs were scaled to the ONS 2015 mid-year estimates for England. The microsimulation started in 2015 since the most recent population statistics were available from that year. However, the future scenarios were implemented from 2017, since this was the start year of the study. Therefore, cumulative figures were calculated from 2017 onwards. Population characteristics varied over time because of aging populations, births, and deaths. In the microsimulation, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were treated as individual risk factors, which were constant over time.</p><p>Asthma, COPD, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and lung cancer were included within the microsimulation based on estimates of associations between exposure to the pollutants and risk of developing the diseases, which were obtained from meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies. Low birth weight and dementia were also included, although the evidence is less well established for these conditions and, for dementia, came from a single prospective cohort study. No costs were available for low birth weight, so only the epidemiological model outputs for this condition are reported (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002602.s003">S3 Text</xref>). At birth, each individual in the microsimulation was probabilistically assigned an age- and sex-specific PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure (i.e., their risk factor). Then, each year, exposure levels were derived using the assumption that the exposure percentile for an individual stays constant over time. The exposure trends were assumed to be static over time. Each year, a simulated individual was at risk of developing a new air-pollution-related NCD, dying from an existing NCD or from other non-air-pollution-related causes, surviving with an existing NCD, or remaining in a disease-free state.</p><p>The microsimulation also contained an economic module that produced Markov-type simulations of long-term health benefits and healthcare costs, including primary and secondary care, medication, and social care costs. The initial cost inputs were adjusted and inflated to 2015 values with a 1.5% inflation rate. The outputs of the simulation were discounted at a 1.5% rate [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The confidence limits that accompany the sets of output data represent the accuracy of the microsimulation as opposed to the confidence of the input data itself. Confidence intervals around the input data were not available.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Exposure data</title><p>We used outdoor air pollution concentration surfaces from land use regression (LUR) models covering England on a 100-m grid for PM<sub>2.5</sub> [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and 200-m grid for NO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the highest resolution map available for each pollutant. These models were developed to support epidemiological studies and take into account both local and long-range transport sources. They have been extensively validated against measured concentrations from the Automatic Urban and Rural Network, which contains over 100 spatially distributed continuous measurement sites [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>We adopted a method described in Gulliver et al. for extrapolation of the air pollution surfaces (from 2010 for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 2009 for NO<sub>2</sub>) to 2015 [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The method compares the difference in rural background concentrations at concomitant sites from the source year (i.e., the year each air pollution surface was developed) and the target year (i.e., 2015) for exposure estimation. These absolute differences are then applied to extrapolate (i.e., reduce) modelled concentrations from the source year to the target year (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002602.s002">S2 Text</xref>).</p><p>Postcode centroids (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic> locations) represent the central address of all addresses sharing the same postcode (an average of 18 households share a postcode in England). We intersected all postcode centroids, from the collection of postcode headcount information as part of the 2011 census in England (<italic>n</italic> = 1,227,431), with the air pollution surface data to obtain PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> estimates for each postcode. We applied a difference of &#x02212;1.2 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> to all PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure estimates from the 2010 model and &#x02212;2.3 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> to all NO<sub>2</sub> exposure estimates from the 2009 model to forward extrapolate them to the 2015 context (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002602.s002">S2 Text</xref>). We estimated pollutant exposures by 5-year age group and sex, by assigning each postcode to the census output area age-sex structure from the ONS mid-year population estimates for 2015 (the most recently available at the time of this study).

Inpatient costs for each disease were estimated using HES, which captures actual healthcare utilisation in NHS hospitals. We adopted a conservative approach and selected only the HES episodes in 2015 for which the main diagnosis corresponded to one of the ICD-10 codes of interest. ICD-10 codes selected for the analysis were as follows: I20&#x02013;I25 (coronary heart disease); E10, E11, O24.4 (type 2 diabetes); J40&#x02013;J44 (COPD); C34 (lung cancer); and I60&#x02013;I63 (stroke). Dementia was not analysed using HES as HES does not include specialised institutions, and we therefore relied entirely on the literature. We then matched each episode based on its NHS Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) to the tariff at which it was reimbursed, and used the NHS Market Forces Factor to account for regional differences in the cost of land, capital, and labour. We estimated an average episode cost per health condition, and multiplied the number of yearly diagnosed cases by the estimated average cost to account for errors in HRG reporting that did not allow a direct match to a tariff.</p><p>When healthcare utilisation data were not available, we relied on literature providing estimates of health and social care costs associated with the conditions of interest. We conducted a literature review and selected studies based on robust and transparent methods. The relevant literature was identified using PubMed and MeSH terms, or Google when no indexed publications reported the cost data of interest. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002602.s003">S3 Text</xref> describes the costs extracted from the literature in more detail. When costs were based on UK-wide or Scottish figures, costs were adjusted for the England population.</p><p>There was a large variation in the definition of social care in the literature. This is due to the lack of available data and the need to rely on some proxy measures, the absence of a clear definition of what counts as social care, and a lack of clear distinction between privately and publicly funded care. Social care costs usually capture costs related to informal care that is funded publicly.</p><p>The microsimulation model uses cost per case or cost per death to calculate the total health and social care costs incurred due to the prevalence of disease.</p><p><xref rid="pmed.1002602.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> provides the cost per case or cost per death for each disease used in the microsimulation model by type of care.

These inflated total costs were then divided by the study country&#x02019;s disease prevalence in 2015 in order to have an average prevalence cost per case.</p><table-wrap id="pmed.1002602.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1002602.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Cost based on total prevalence of each disease, expressed in British pounds per prevalence case per year.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pmed.1002602.t003g" xlink:href="pmed.1002602.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Disease</th><th align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Cost (British pounds per case) by type of care</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary care</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary care</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medication</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Social care</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asthma</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.28</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.02</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87.57</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.50<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">400.43</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">587.48</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">126.79</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.30<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coronary heart disease</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.57</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,460.46</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">818.60</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">109.70</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.45</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">722.84</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">504.10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.05<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">375.00</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">536.75</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">276.88</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">601.56<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lung cancer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.73<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">466.63<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.10<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.38<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn001">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dementia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">430.62</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">197.24</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">310.24</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6,174.47</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t003fn001"><p>*Indicates cost per death for palliative care.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Scenarios</title><p>Different scenarios were run within the microsimulation:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Baseline &#x02018;no change&#x02019; scenario, where PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure stays at 2015 levels.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Each individual&#x02019;s PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure is reduced to natural (non-anthropogenic sources) levels and compared to the no-change scenario, where exposure stays at current levels.

social care &#x000a3;76.10 million and NO<sub>2</sub> was estimated to cost &#x000a3;81.06 million. These estimated costs are the result of 63,430 attributable incident cases of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related diseases and 60,648 attributable incident cases of NO<sub>2</sub>-related diseases occurring in 2017. This accounts for around 10% of the total burden of diseases related to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and around 9% of the total burden of diseases related to NO<sub>2</sub> in 2017. Between 2017 and 2025, the total cost to the NHS and social care of air pollution in England was estimated to be &#x000a3;1.54 billion for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and &#x000a3;60.81 million for NO<sub>2</sub>, increasing to &#x000a3;2.81 billion and &#x000a3;2.75 billion, respectively, when all diseases associated with these pollutants are included (strong and weaker evidence combined). Secondary care was estimated to contribute most to PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related costs, and social care to contribute most to NO<sub>2</sub>-related costs. This latter finding is due to the inclusion of dementia as a disease related to NO<sub>2</sub> (but not PM<sub>2.5</sub>), which has a very high social care cost burden. We estimated that reducing each pollutant by 1 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> in 1 year alone would have important long-term impacts on health. Avoiding disease cases is necessary if disease burden from air pollution is to be reduced.</p><p>This study complements existing work in a number of ways. First, using population attributable fractions, studies have found that outdoor air pollution contributes to around 40,000 premature deaths a year [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], of which 29,000 deaths are attributed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and 11,000 to NO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Second, previous calculations costed mortality due to air pollution, estimating between &#x000a3;8.5 billion and &#x000a3;20.2 billion a year [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], based on the &#x02018;willingness to pay&#x02019; approach [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a complementary approach, the costs quantified in the present study represent the costs of treating air-pollution-related diseases in the NHS and social care system. Finally, this study also complements the work by COMEAP on the short-term impacts of NO<sub>2</sub> on health while extending their work on long-term impacts [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>This study has both strengths and limitations. The use of a microsimulation model is a key strength of this study since it models many millions of individuals over time (rather than groups/cohorts using weighted averages, as in many studies) and records this history to determine an individual&#x02019;s future risk of NCDs over the long term. However, this approach prevented us from estimating the impact of short-term risks, since we were interested in annual disease and cost outputs. Short-term peaks in air pollution are unpredictable, both temporally and geospatially, and driven by short-term meteorology, and are therefore not straightforward to predict based on annual averages alone. Short-term peaks may exacerbate disease and increase secondary care, therefore causing greater NHS costs. However, it is unclear how short-term and long-term risks overlap. Further, to analyse short-term risks, the microsimulation model would require daily/monthly disease incidence data in order to initialise the microsimulation model population and quantify the impact of a daily spike in air pollution versus baseline levels, data for which are not available. Further, we assumed a flat trend of pollutant exposure into the future. Modelling dynamic future air pollution trends would require establishing future emission and policy scenarios that could inform the model. Modelling dynamic future trends is very complex, as illustrated by Williams et al. [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and often results in unintended consequences (such as the promotion of diesel fuel 2 decades ago and the resultant increase in nitrogen dioxide levels). For this study, we therefore decided against modelling future air pollution scenarios and their related uncertainties and instead focused on scenarios that impact the study population equally, e.g., reduction of exposure levels by 1 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>. The set-up of the microsimulation would, however, allow running specific scenarios in the future.</p><p>One limitation of the model is that it does not incorporate the effect of uncertainty of parameters, such as the distribution of standard errors from the air pollution surfaces, which would alter the surface and consequently the postcode estimates and resulting cost estimates. Such uncertainty might arise from the use of ambient concentrations at place of residence (the exposure metrics that are used for most long-term air pollution exposure studies such as those used to derive the exposure&#x02013;response functions used in this study) rather than personal exposure. Similarly, the uncertainty around the exposure&#x02013;response association is likely to impact findings since effect estimates were obtained from meta-analyses of prospective longitudinal studies, which cannot adjust for all potential confounding. The robustness of effect sizes varied across the conditions included in the model, and some emerging exposure&#x02013;response relationships, i.e., for dementia and low birth weight, were obtained from a more recent, developing evidence base. We noted the difference in robustness, and interpret the results including the costs of dementia and low birth weight with more caution. The microsimulation was also limited by the availability and quality of the cost data, most of which were extracted from the literature, so they are not fully comparable. However, their different magnitudes are reliable estimates of the cost burdens. In many cases the cost estimates represent lower bound estimates of the true costs to the health and social care systems; therefore, our results are likely to underestimate the true burden. Further work is required, potentially using primary care datasets to gather more up-to-date and accurate estimates of healthcare utilisation and the cost per case of each disease. As the main objective of this project was to estimate the direct cost of pollution for the NHS and social care, societal costs, such as sick leave and loss of income, were not accounted for. Therefore, one should bear in mind that the costs reported here represent only a share of the overall societal costs related to air pollution.</p><p>There is a lack of reporting of uncertainty on input data as only dose&#x02013;response uncertainties were available in the literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002602.s002">S2 Text</xref>). Furthermore, correlation between the model parameters as well as the complexity and non-linearity of the microsimulation meant that we could only include Monte Carlo errors using a normal distribution around the outputs. Indeed, parametric uncertainty analysis using a highly complex tool such as the UK Health Forum microsimulation would require running many thousands of consecutive runs, and would require a super computer. Unfortunately, it was beyond the resources and scope of the present project to do this.</p><p>This study had a relatively narrow focus on just PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>; therefore, we are likely to be underestimating the full impact of air pollution on the NHS and social care. Future work should build on this model to include additional pollutants such as ozone, ultra-fine particulates, and volatile organic compounds. Using COMEAP recommendations for mortality, we adjusted NO<sub>2</sub> dose&#x02013;response relationships by 60% to take account of overlapping effects with PM<sub>2.5</sub> [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, no guidance exists for possible adjustments for PM<sub>2.5</sub> dose&#x02013;response metrics. Future work might model multiple interacting pollutant risks for morbidity outcomes.</p><p>While England has reduced PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels to below the limit values set by the EU, the magnitude of the number of cases and the NHS and social care costs that could potentially be avoided by reaching EU targets for NO<sub>2</sub> makes a strong argument for policy action towards significantly reducing air pollution concentrations in England, to improve the quality of life of individuals as well as reduce current pressures on the health system, specifically secondary and social care.</p><p>This study therefore has important implications for policy makers since it makes the economic case for investment in interventions to reduce air pollution and substantiates why exposure to air pollution is a key public health priority, as highlighted in Public Health England&#x02019;s 2016&#x02013;2017 remit letter [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This study supports work that sets out actions to be taken to reduce air pollution, namely the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#x02019; report on reducing roadside NO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance on traffic-related air pollution [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and provides evidence to support third sector campaigns, such as the campaign for a new Clean Air Act [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Client Earth&#x02019;s legal action to bring down illegal levels of pollution [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Measures aimed at reducing air pollution do not just impact health but, importantly, could have many co-benefits, such as reducing road traffic accidents [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], increasing use of public transport, supporting sustainable development [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], mitigating climate change [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], reducing noise pollution [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], improving mental health and well-being [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], increasing workers&#x02019; productivity [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], increasing active travel and consequently physical activity [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and improving the health of vulnerable groups (children, the elderly, and socioeconomically deprived individuals) [<xref rid="pmed.1002602.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>More work is needed to build on the current evidence base. The microsimulation model presented here is a flexible and validated tool that can easily be expanded to include additional pollutants and different populations (e.g., local authorities) and to test the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a range of different interventions to reduce future air-pollution-related disease burden. The microsimulation also has the capability to include non-healthcare costs due to disease burden (i.e., indirect costs due to lost productivity) so a wider societal approach could be taken. Future work might also explore combining methods such as a spatial agent-based modelling approach with a microsimulation to enable short- and long-term effects to be modelled together or running additional pollutants in the model.</p><p>Investment in reducing air pollution is crucial if a broad range of benefits related to health, quality of life, and the wider society are to be gained; therefore, controlling and reducing air pollution should be a key priority for the UK Government. Effective interventions should be implemented through collaboration between environmental, town planning, and public health policy makers, ensuring that environmental policies consider health as a primary outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002602.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Technical appendix.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002602.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002602.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Population and disease data.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002602.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002602.s003"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>Cost methods.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002602.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002602.s004"><label>S4 Text</label><caption><title>Results by disease and cost parameter.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002602.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Prof Paul Lincoln, Members of the Public Health England Steering Committee, Dr Sotiris Vardoulakis, and Dr Karen Exley for their advice and guidance, and John Guzek, Dheeya Rizmie, and Paula Christen for their support with data preparation.</p><p>The work of the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit is funded by Public Health England as part of the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, funded also by the UK Medical Research Council.
