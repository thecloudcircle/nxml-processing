The 1-, 2- and 3-year OS was 85.7%, 57.1% and 42.9% in the study, respectively. This study indicated that transperineal cryoablation may be an attractive alternative treatment for unresectable pT4b stage bladder cancer. This technique also could applicable to patients who could not tolerate cystectomy due to the minimal invasion.</p><p id="Par28">According to our preliminary experience of transperineal cryosurgery for unresectable MIBC of 7 male patients, we believe that the following is the key to ensure cryotherapy successful. Firstly, the use of TRUS to monitor the appearance of the ice ball as well as to guide cryoprobe placement to avoid any injury to other tissues, especially rectum. Secondly, the placement of temperature monitoring probes around tumor and rectum to enhance the temperature information provided by TRUS. Moreover, the success of this procedure benefits from the previous experience of transperineal cryosurgery for prostate cancer in our hospital. Furthermore, patient selection is also very important.</p><p id="Par29">In this study, we describe a cryosurgery alone, cryo-chemoradiation or cryo-chemotherapy combination as an alternative treatment in unresectable pT4b stage bladder cancer. We believe that reduction local tumor burden through cryosurgery and followed with chemoradiation or chemotherapy will benefit more than chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone for locally advanced BC. Moreover, we believe that patients with the pT4b stage unresectable disease will benefited more from this procedure than pN2-3 patients. However, the retrospective design raises the issue of potential selection bias which are likely to have influenced the results of the present study. Moreover, it is limited by its small series and single-institution study design. Future prospective, large-scale and long-term studies are needed in multiply centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">Transperineal cryoablation combination with chemoradiotherapy may be an option in the treatment of unresectable invasive bladder cancer due to unresectable disease secondary to fixation to the pelvis and/or rectum (pT4b) and these patients who could not tolerate cystectomy. The side effects were relatively mild and a PFS of 22.00&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14.61&#x000a0;months can be achieved. A larger number of cases is required, however, and long-term survival following this therapy and its role in combination with other therapies awaits further research.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BC</term><def><p id="Par5">bladder cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par6">computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIBC</term><def><p id="Par7">muscle invasive bladder cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p id="Par8">overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFS</term><def><p id="Par9">Progression free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLND</term><def><p id="Par10">pelvic lymph node dissection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RC</term><def><p id="Par11">radical cystectomy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRUS</term><def><p id="Par12">transrectal ultrasound</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TURBT</term><def><p id="Par13">transurethral resection of bladder tumor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UD</term><def><p id="Par14">urinary diversion</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all our participants for their gracious participation in this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par31">No funding was obtained for this study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par32">The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the Nanjing drum tower hospital Medical Records Room data base (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) repository.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>QZ conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; drafting of manuscript.
