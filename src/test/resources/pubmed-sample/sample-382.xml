Extensive research to assess the effect of castration on the welfare of the piglets indicates that castration causes significant stress, pain and discomfort that can persist for up to 4 days [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Castration of piglets is usually performed without anaesthesia or analgesia, presumably because the anaesthetic techniques commonly used for comparable surgeries in human and veterinary medicine (general anaesthesia or sedation, local anaesthetic infiltration and / or local or regional nerve blockade) are either too complex, costly and time consuming to be practical or affordable for use on-farm. A number of publications have described the effective use of analgesic and anaesthetic interventions to address the pain associated with piglet husbandry procedures [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] although these options may be considered neither practical nor affordable for large scale production systems.</p><p>The European Union (EU) legislated that as of January 2012, surgical castration of pigs must utilize prolonged local anaesthesia and/or analgesia, with the aim of removing the practice altogether by 2018. Whilst cost-benefit analyses conducted in relation to this legislation indicate that general and local anaesthesia strategies are beneficial, in other jurisdictions such as Australia the costs of lsuch procedures are considered excessive, particularly where veterinarians are required by law to administer restricted drugs such as lignocaine [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Tri-Solfen&#x000ae; (Bayer Animal Health, Pymble, Australia) is a commercially available topical anesthetic spray-on wound dressing with haemostatic and antiseptic properties, registered in Australia for the alleviation of pain of castration in sheep and cattle. It contains lignocaine (40.6 g/L), bupivacaine (4.5 g/L), adrenalin (24.8 mg/L) and cetrimide (5.0 g/L) in a gel base, and has been reported to be effective in ameliorating wound pain and improving healing during mulesing, castration and tail docking in sheep and castration in calves [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Due to the efficacy of this product for reducing the post surgical pain associated with castration in lambs and calves, and the similar anatomical nature of the wounds induced in porcine castration, we studied the efficacy of Tri-Solfen&#x000ae; in the amelioration of the pain of castration in piglets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by The University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (AEC Approval No. 742).</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>The trial was performed using 40 Landrace x Large white piglets sourced from a commercial herd at The University of Sydney Farms near Cobbitty, NSW.

Piglets were removed for the procedure and subsequent wound sensitivity testing, and retained in large crates containing a sawdust floor cover for the 5 hour duration of the study, with an overhead heat lamp providing warmth. The piglets were returned to their sows on conclusion of the observation period.</p><p>The trial was conducted over a three day period using piglets from six litters with 12 piglets treated on days one and two, and 16 on day three.

Piglets were removed from the crate and restrained by their hind limbs in a vertical position with the head down. The scrotum was exposed and each scrotal sac and tunica received a small (1.5cm) incision with a sterile scalpel to express the testes. The exposed testes were then excised following incision of the spermatic cord. The whole procedure including TRI treatment, took less than 1 minute per animal. Sham-castrated piglets were handled and restrained similarly to the castrates, with the scrotum and testes manipulated, but no incision made. Piglets in the TRI group received 1mL of Tri-Solfen&#x000ae; spray to each scrotal incision upon exposure of the testis using a 1mL pipette to apply 0.5mL to the cut skin edge and spermatic cord prior to excision. The pipette end was then inserted along the spermatic cord inside the wound to apply a further 0.5mL to ensure that all retracted tissue was coated (12).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Wound sensitivity testing (WST)</title><p>WST involved von Frey monofilaments of weights 4g and 300g, and an 18 gauge needle, used to stimulate the wound and surrounding skin respectively, at various pre-determined sites.

Application of topical anaesthetic provided amelioration of pain up to 4h post procedure for piglets undergoing surgical castration using the farmer-applied, spray-on topical anaesthetic Tri-Solfen&#x000ae;.

They are absorbed through mucosal surfaces and damaged skin, and can induce rapid and profound local anaesthesia when applied to open wounds [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187988.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187988.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Tissue damage resulting from castration results in the localized release of chemical mediators including substance P and bradykinin, invoking an inflammatory response, with vasodilation, oedema and increased nociception leading to hyperalgesia [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187988.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These mediators can have a prolonged effect, leading to increased sensitization of neurons to nociceptive signals (hyperalgesia), and exacerbated pain to noxious stimuli. Local anaesthetics suppress bradykinin and substance P-mediated signaling, with attenuation of cutaneous micro-vascular flare responses in damaged tissue and reduced inflammation, decreasing hyperalgesia of the wound and surrounding skin.</p><p>Local anaesthesia via injection of has been shown to reduce pain accompanied by significant reductions in the cortisol response of surgical castration [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187988.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our findings indicate that topical anaesthetic spray causes a similar reduction in pain, with CAST piglets displaying a greater response to wound stimulation than SHAM or TRI piglets. These findings are consistent with previous observations of piglets receiving local anaesthetic infiltration of the spermatic cord and scrotum [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187988.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and with observations of absent or significantly reduced pain responses in lambs and calves treated with topical anaesthetic into castration wounds [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0187988.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In this study, piglets had the greatest response to needle pin prick stimulation of the tissue within and surrounding the wound. This was expected as this stimulus is known to induce a detectable pain response [<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187988.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This method proved successful at detecting the presence or absence of anaesthesia in the wound and surrounding tissues as sham castrated piglets displayed a response to needle stimulation at all time points.</p><p>Castrated piglets that did not receive topical anesthetic had significantly greater pain responses from 2 to 4 hours following castration, demonstrating the recruitment of the pain cascade in CAST piglets not receiving any pain management. It appears likely that the pain management from the injected lignocaine in LIG piglets had diminished by the 2 h time point, as there was a rise in sensitivity from 30min to 1.5 h, and the responses of LIG piglets did not differ from CAST piglets after 2 h. This is to be expected as the lignocaine is reported to have effect for 1.5&#x02013;2 hrs. In addition, it is possible that the injected lignocaine had little effect on the skin and peri-testicular tissue, leaving them vulnerable to nociception.</p><p>TRI piglets displayed apparent wound anaesthesia up to 4 h, with significantly lower pain scores than CAST and LIG piglets. The inclusion of long acting Bupivicaine in the topical anaesthetic may explain this extended duration. This indicates that topical anaesthetic spray is effective at reducing wound pain for a prolonged period following castration.</p><p>Response scores of castrated piglets were not significantly different immediately following castration (1min). It is hypothesized that this was due to the up-regulation of sensory receptors following the incision, resulting in a release of natural pain mediators including endorphins to mitigate immediate pain associated with the incision and tissue removal. From 30min following castration TRI treated piglets had the lowest pain response scores, indicating effective anaesthesia to wound stimulation for at least 4 h.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings suggests that the global pig industries currently using piglet castration, may benefit from consideration of these findings as they offer a possible means of improving the welfare of male piglets during this routine but painful husbandry procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187988.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Anonymised dataset.</title><p>This is the dataset used for analysis in this trial.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187988.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the contributions of Mr Gregory MacNamara for his assistance during trials and Dr Evelyn Hall for statistical support.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187988.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Vulin</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Genin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sales</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Prunier</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Assessment of pain induced by castration in piglets: behavioural and physiological responses over the subsequent five days</article-title>. <source>Appl Anim Behav Sci</source>. <year>2003</year>;<volume>82</volume>:<fpage>201</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>18</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0187988.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Moya</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Boyle</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Arkins</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>Effect of surgical castration on the behavioural and acute phase responses of 5-day-old piglets</article-title>. <source>Appl Anim Behav Sci</source>. <year>2008</year>;<volume>111</volume>(<issue>1/2</issue>):<fpage>133</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>45</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0187988.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Prunier</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bonneau</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Borell</surname><given-names>EHv</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cinotti</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gunn</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fredriksen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
