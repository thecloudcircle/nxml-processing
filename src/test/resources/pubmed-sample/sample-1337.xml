The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a community-based preventive intervention on stroke mortality in rural Gadchiroli, India.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study is a two-arm, parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial in which 32 villages will be randomised to the intervention and the enhanced usual care (EUC) arm. In the intervention arm, individuals &#x02265;50&#x02009;years of age will be screened for hypertension, diabetes and stroke by trained Community Health Workers (CHWs). Screened individuals who are positive will be referred to a mobile outreach clinic which will visit the intervention villages&#x000a0;periodically. A physician in the clinic will confirm the diagnosis, provide guideline-based treatment and follow up patients. The CHWs will make home visits once a month to ensure medication compliance and counsel patients to reduce salt consumption and quit tobacco and alcohol. In the EUC arm, households will be provided information on the ill effects of tobacco use and steps to quit it. Individuals from both the arms will have access to the government&#x02019;s national programme for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, where treatment for hypertension, diabetes and preventive treatment after stroke is available at the nearest primary health centres (PHCs). The intervention will be implemented for 3.5&#x02009;years. The primary outcome will be a reduction in stroke mortality in the last 2.5&#x02009;years of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial will provide important information regarding the feasibility and effect of a community-based preventive intervention package on stroke mortality in a rural under-resourced setting and can inform India&#x02019;s non-communicable diseases prevention and control programme.

Nearly two thirds of India&#x02019;s population lives in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]&#x000a0;and studies conducted by us and others have shown that stroke has emerged as a major public health problem in&#x000a0;these areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In rural Gadchiroli in India, stroke was the leading cause of death and accounted for 14% of all deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The prevalence of stroke was also high (535/100,000 population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Stroke is also a global health priority and&#x000a0;is a leading cause of death in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The burden of disease due to stroke has now shifted from higher income countries to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with 71% of stroke deaths occurring in these countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Large populations in these LMICs live in rural areas and do not have easy access to preventive or curative care for stroke. The consequences of stroke could be severe in such communities, where resources are scarce. Therefore, well-tested interventions to reduce stroke deaths in the rural areas of India and other LMICs are urgently needed. However, such interventions are currently lacking.</p><p id="Par7">Stroke is preventable. The INTERSTROKE study has identified ten modifiable risk factors, which account for 90% of the risk of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Among these, hypertension is the leading risk factor and accounts for approximately 50% of the risk of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Hypertension control, therefore, emerges as an important target for stroke prevention. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for death, killing 9 million people globally every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the World Health Organization considers hypertension control a &#x02018;best buy&#x02019; to reduce cardiovascular deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite this, the screening, diagnosis and control of hypertension remains poor in rural India. In a nationally representative study, hypertension was undetected in 60% of women and 70% of men in rural India, and it was controlled in only 50% of those who were diagnosed with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, only 15&#x02013;20% of patients with hypertension had their blood pressure adequately controlled. Another large study based on the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) showed similar findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among rural individuals aged 15&#x02013;49&#x02009;years diagnosed with hypertension, only 72% had received a previous blood pressure measurement, 42% were aware of their diagnosis, 12% were treated, and only 8% had achieved control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Diabetes is another risk factor for stroke, and the control of diabetes also remains poor in rural India. A large multi-state study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research and involving 14,277 participants showed that good glycaemic control (HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7%) was present in only 30% of individuals with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Secondary prevention of stroke also remains poor in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study, which included patients from rural India, found that only 27% of patients in the rural regions of LMICs were receiving anti-platelet agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Collectively, these studies highlight a significant care gap in stroke prevention in rural India, where 12% of the world&#x02019;s population lives.</p><p id="Par9">Several challenges exist to the prevention and control of stroke and its risk factors in rural India. Awareness about these conditions remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hypertension and diabetes often do not have symptoms, and their diagnosis gets delayed. Screening facilities are not widely available, and even after screening, only a fraction of patients receive a confirmed diagnosis. Continuity of care remains a challenge because of the lack of affordability, accessibility and prioritization of care, leading to suboptimal control of these conditions. To address the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the Government of India has launched an ambitious National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). This programme has started screening individuals at the village level, and for diagnosis and treatment, individuals have to&#x000a0;travel to the Primary Health Centres (PHCs), the closest point of contact with a physician in the public health care system in rural areas, where treatment is provided free of cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, implementation of the programme has been slow and travel to the PHCs is challenging because of a lack of transportation facilities in rural areas.</p><p id="Par10">To reduce stroke mortality, we have designed a community-based healthcare delivery intervention package which tries to address major barriers to the effective control of hypertension and diabetes and to the secondary prevention of stroke in a rural under-resourced setting in India.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study hypothesis</title><p id="Par11">The study will test the hypothesis that a community-based healthcare delivery intervention for primary and secondary prevention of stroke is feasible and will reduce stroke mortality in a rural community in Gadchiroli.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par12">

Gadchiroli is located in the state of Maharashtra in central India (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). According to the Indian National Census 2011, the total population of the district was 10,72,942 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Ninety percent of the population of this district lives in rural areas, the literacy rate is 66%, and farming and manual labour are the predominant occupations in the district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Each SDH typically covers a population of 100,000, whereas one PHC covers a population of 20,000&#x02013;30,000. Care for hypertension, diabetes and preventive care for stroke is available free of cost at the PHCs, SDHs and the DH through the NPCDCS. Community level workers referred to as ASHAs have recently&#x000a0;started&#x000a0;screening of individuals with hypertension, diabetes and cancer at the village level through this programme. In addition to the government-run health services, care is also provided by formal and informal private healthcare providers and some non-governmental organisations. After acute stroke, patients are either admitted to the district hospital, private hospitals or seek care from herbal medicine providers. Brain imaging is not easily available because only one computerized tomography (CT) scanner is available in the entire district. In a population-based study conducted by us in the villages of Gadchiroli, only 12% of stroke patients received brain imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Facilities to give intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) also are not available in the district.</p><p id="Par25">SEARCH (Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health) is a non-governmental organization working in the Gadchiroli district since 1986. It has a service area of 86 villages distributed in three administrative blocks (Gadchiroli, Armori and Chamorshi, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) of the district. In these villages, SEARCH has an active demographic surveillance system where all births and deaths are regularly recorded. Information on the cause of death is obtained on all deaths through verbal autopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A population census is conducted every 10&#x02009;years, and the last census was conducted in 2015. A population register is maintained, which is updated annually. SEARCH also runs a rural hospital where primary and secondary level outpatient and inpatient care is provided at a nominal cost and includes care for hypertension, diabetes and stroke. SEARCH, in collaboration with the state government of Maharashtra, also runs a district-wide campaign to reduce the consumption of tobacco and alcohol by generating awareness, enforcing legal restrictions on sales and mobilising communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p id="Par26">From the sampling frame of 86 villages in the service area of SEARCH, 32 villages will be randomly assigned to the intervention arm and 32 to the EUC arm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) so that an equal number of villages from each of the three blocks are assigned per arm. Allocation of the villages will be done by the statistician at SEARCH using the random number generator in the statistical software Stata (College Station, TX, USA).

Hypertension, diabetes, alcohol and tobacco use will be targeted. Obesity and lack of physical activity will not be targeted because these are not locally important risk factors given that the population is lean and is engaged in physical labour. Modifications of diet and addressing psychosocial factors were not considered feasible given limited food choices and the lack of an available effective intervention to target psychosocial factors in this area. In a formative study conducted before starting the trial, people felt that it would be convenient for them if a physician could visit the village and then a village-level worker could follow up patients and provide counselling.

We plan to select women community health workers for three reasons. First, in this region men often travel outside the villages for small jobs in non-farming seasons and, hence, are not available in the village. Second, one of the responsibilities of the CHW is to counsel patients to quit tobacco and alcohol. In Gadchiroli, tobacco consumption is very common among men and less so in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], whereas alcohol use is almost completely restricted to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, finding a male worker who will not be using alcohol and tobacco would be very challenging. Third, the acceptance of a male worker examining women is low in this traditional community.

The OP will evaluate patients referred by the CHWs, confirm diagnosis of hypertension by rechecking blood pressure, diagnose diabetes by checking random capillary blood glucose (RCBG) using a glucometer (Accu-Chek Active) and clinically confirm the diagnosis of stroke using WHO&#x02019;s definition of stroke as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

At the beginning of the trial, a stroke survey physician will confirm the diagnosis of stroke, and a list of stroke patients will be provided to the OP to evaluate these patients and start treatment. Stroke patients will receive secondary prophylaxis using low-dose atorvastatin (10&#x02009;mg) and enteric-coated aspirin (75&#x02009;mg) as per the treatment algorithm of the study (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Stroke patients who had loss of consciousness or seizures at the onset of symptoms will be presumed to have had a haemorrhagic stroke. These patients and those with intra-cerebral haemorrhage on brain imaging will not be prescribed aspirin. The goal of the anti-hypertensive treatment will be to maintain blood pressure&#x02009;&#x0003c;140/90&#x02009;mmHg among those with hypertension and&#x02009;&#x0003c;130/80&#x02009;mmHg among those with diabetes and chronic renal failure but to keep it &#x0003e;100/60&#x02009;mmHg. Among diabetes patients, the target will be to keep RCBG between 100 and 200&#x02009;mg/dL. Patients with stroke, if they have hypertension or diabetes, will be treated according to the guidelines for treatment of these conditions. All the trial medicines, urine and blood glucose testing will be provided free of cost to the patients during the study period. The OP will refer patients to the rural hospital of SEARCH if hypertension or diabetes cannot be controlled with trial medications, if patients are unable to tolerate any of the trial medications or when cardiac diseases (angina, atrial fibrillation or heart failure) or renal failure are clinically suspected. If screened individuals or patients who are being followed up develop acute stroke during the intervention period, they will be started on treatment for secondary prevention of stroke once they are back to their homes after receiving acute care for stroke. Also, individuals who did not have hypertension or diabetes at the time of screening but are incidentally diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes at a later date by the OP or another physician during the study period and wish to take treatment from the outreach clinic will be enrolled in the intervention and will receive treatment as per the study treatment algorithm. Participants will be allowed to continue medications for other ailments from their regular physicians. If participants wish to take medications for hypertension, diabetes or stroke from other physicians but wish to get their blood pressure or blood glucose checked by the OP, they will be allowed to do so if they provide a consent. Patients who wish to discontinue the treatment provided in the trial will be free to do so at any point during the trial.

The CHW will also counsel patients not to have added salt during meals and quit tobacco and alcohol. CHWs will have a stock of the trial medications available with them. If blood pressure control is inadequate or the patient is not tolerating a medication, then the CHWs will inform the OP over phone and make modifications to the treatment as instructed. This will be done to ensure that side effects are addressed in a timely manner, and hypertension control is ensured before the next village visit of the OP. If a patient fails to attend the mobile clinic, then the OP will instruct the CHW to provide medications prescribed during the previous visit to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medications. CHWs will also provide individual health education to patients regarding hypertension, diabetes and stroke using videos and animations in the local Marathi language specifically designed for this purpose. These videos and animations will be shown using hand-held computers. In every home visit, the CHW will inquire about current alcohol and tobacco use among the patients.

We will compare stroke mortality in the two arms in the last 2.5&#x02009;years of the intervention period. We selected stroke mortality as the primary outcome for two reasons: first, the trial was planned in an attempt to address a local public health problem, i.e. high stroke mortality in rural Gadchiroli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and second, because non-randomised studies of community-based interventions from Taiwan and Japan have shown the feasibility of reducing stroke mortality over a reasonably short period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Verbal autopsies will be conducted on all deaths in the intervention and EUC arms during the intervention period using a verbal autopsy tool which was validated in the Million Death Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Verbal autopsies have relatively high sensitivity (&#x02265;75%) and specificity (&#x0003e;90%) in diagnosing stroke in validation studies conducted in India and other countries and remain an important tool to assess stroke mortality in resource-poor settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Verbal autopsies will be coded by two trained physicians independently. If the two coders do not agree, a third physician will adjudicate the cause of death.

This assumption was based on a study in Taiwan where a community-based hypertension control programme resulted in a 40% decrease in stroke mortality rate in the entire population over 3&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. As we plan to measure stroke mortality in only the high-risk population (&#x02265;50&#x02009;years of age) with relatively less access to care and because the intervention uses strategies for both primary and secondary prevention, we assume that the intervention will result in at least 40% reduction in stroke mortality in the given period. We used the formula by Hayes and Bennett to estimate the sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We assumed the between-cluster correlation coefficient of variation (k) for stroke mortality to be 0.2, as such data were not available from population-based studies.

In these resource-poor areas, community-based interventions involving community members could be an important strategy to reduce stroke mortality. Such interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing infant mortality and controlling infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, a paucity of evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of community-based interventions for chronic non-communicable diseases in rural areas of LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Hypertension is one of the key risk factors for stroke, and recent trials show that community-based approaches for hypertension control could be useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The primary outcomes of these trials have been a reduction in blood pressure and not a reduction in cardiovascular events. To our knowledge this is the first cluster randomised controlled trial from a rural area of a LMIC to evaluate the effect of such an intervention to reduce stroke mortality. Our study thus provides an important value addition over previous studies by combining primary and secondary prevention of stroke at the community level and going a step further to evaluate if such an intervention would reduce stroke mortality in a resource poor setting. The insights gained from this study will provide important inputs for the Government of India&#x02019;s ambitious programme for the prevention and control of chronic diseases (NPCDCS), which is one of the largest programmes in the world of its kind to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. This programme currently focuses on community-level screening and facility-level treatment of chronic diseases but currently does not have a component of community-level follow up. Our study will help to evaluate the importance of community-level treatment and follow up. If successful, the study intervention can be scaled up in other rural and under-resourced settings in the world.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par75">The trial will be recruiting patients until December 2019.
