In this study, we determined the effect of hsa-miR-125b-5p on interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; induced inflammatory genes in human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes. Bioinformatics algorithms showed 3&#x02032;untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of TRAF6 mRNA (NM_004620.3) has perfectly matched &#x02018;seed-sequence&#x02019; for hsa-miR-125b-5p. Treatment of cells with IL-1&#x003b2; up-regulates TRAF6 mRNA and down-regulates hsa-miR-125b-5p expression. This negative correlation between TRAF6 and hsa-miR-125b-5p was verified by transfection with miR-125b mimic (pre-miR-125b). Moreover, transfection with miR-125b mimic caused marked inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2;-induced phosphorylation of p38-MAPK, JNK-MAPKs and ERK-MAPKs and also suppressed the nuclear levels of NF-&#x003ba;Bp50, NF-&#x003ba;Bp65 and inhibited the activation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. Furthermore, transfected chondrocytes with miR-125b mimic in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; also showed marked inhibition in the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors including IL-6, IL-8, INF-&#x003b3;, TGF-&#x003b2;1, IGFBP-1 and PGDF-BB. Importantly, this transfection also significantly inhibited IL-1&#x003b2;- induced MMP-13 expression/production. In short, this study concludes that hsa-miR-125b-5p acts as a negative co-regulator of inflammatory genes including MMP-13 via targeting TRAF6/MAPKs/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in human OA chondrocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Non-coding RNAs</kwd><kwd>RNAi</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004919</institution-id><institution>King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11-BIO1885-09</award-id><award-id>11-BIO1885-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rasheed</surname><given-names>Zafar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common health problems of the joints, affecting individuals globally. Its onset occurs when the breakdown of the cartilage tissue begins. Although in OA, any joint tissues can be damaged, but it generally effects on the knees and the hips<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It is now well established that the mechanisms occur in OA are multifactorial, but its etiology remains to be fully explored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The cartilage in the joints is mainly comprised of a condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) with a random scattering of highly specialized cells known as articular chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Articular chondrocytes are well known single cell type of the cartilage that maintain its hemostasis by the regeneration of the constituents of ECM and the cartilage degrading enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and now this cell type becomes the first choice to study and to understand the pathogenesis involved in OA. The molecular evidences indicate that the pathogenesis of OA is well linked with the overproduction of potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2;, which plays an important function in the cartilage breakdown through upregulation of potent cartilage degrading enzymes including aggrecanases, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)s and also promotes productions of other mediators of inflammation including proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and several growth factors known to involve in cartilage degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">MicroRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding small nucleic acids play important role in modulation of their target genes by binding with their complementary sequences at 3&#x02032;untranslated regions (3&#x02032;UTR) during the post transcriptional processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In the recent years, several miRNAs were defined and now it is expected that about more than 30% of all mammalian genes are regulated by miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. So far, the function of miRNAs was discovered in several human disorders and several miRNAs were already reported to regulate the disease modifying genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and now we believe that the miRNA regulation is not only important for the disease detection but also for the therapeutic applications.</p><p id="Par4">In OA, the regulatory function of miRNAs has somewhat defined in the cartilage pathophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Studies showed the involvement of miRNAs in several stages of cartilage development, homeostasis, and disease onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In our earlier studies, we characterized the global expression of miRNAs in stimulated human OA chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In another study, we showed that the expression of an enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is regulated by hsa-miR-26a-5p through direct recognition with its 3&#x02032;-UTR in human OA chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, we also demonstrated in human OA chondrocytes that inflammatory cell signaling is linked with the negative co-relation of hsa-miR-26a-5p and iNOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that miRNAs hsa-miR-199a-3p and hsa-miR-140-3p negatively regulate COX-2 and ADAMTS-5 expression, respectively in human OA chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Recently, the function of miR-125b was discovered in various cell types and its association with several human disorders was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In OA, the function of miR-125b was somewhat defined by few studies only, in one study miR-125b was reported to regulate aggrecanase-1 expression in human chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and in another study, miR-125b was reported to regulate the inflammatory activities in stimulated chondrogenic cells via MIP-1&#x003b1; signaling event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These reports clearly pointing out the importance of miR-125b in OA, but need to be further investigated.</p><p id="Par5">In arthritic joints, chondrocytes are well known to secrete number of proinfammatory mediators extensively including MMP-13 and an overproduction of MMP-13 in the joints are known to promote cartilage breakdown and to induce join pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Now we believe that strategy that target MMP-13 is a most powerful way to manage the onset of joints pain in OA. In one of our previous studies, we discovered that miRNA hsa-miR-27b-3p regulates MMP-13 expression/production via direct binding with its 3&#x02032;UTR in human OA chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Now it is also known that the degeneration of arthritic joints is well linked to the abnormal production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and various growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and in chondrocytes IL-1&#x003b2; is well-known to increase the secretion of several potent cytokines, chemokines and growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In view of the recently discovered role of hsa-miR-125b-5p in cartilage biology and the overproduction of MMP-13 or other mediators of inflammation in arthritic joints here we demonstrated that whether MMP-13 expression/production or production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines or growth factors have been regulated by hsa-miR-125b-5p in human OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1&#x003b2;. Our findings show that the hsa-miR-125b-5p regulates MMP-13 expression/production and several proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines or growth factors through TRAF6 mediated MAPKs and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling in stimulated human OA chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bioinformatics approach for the determination of hsa-miRNA-125b-5p target genes</title><p id="Par6">We used microRNA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mirdb.org/">http://mirdb.org/</ext-link>) to determine hsa-miR-125b-5p predicted target genes.

Recent studies pointed out the role of miRNAs in OA pathology, which are assumed to play a role in cartilage breakdown through pairing with genes relevant to OA pathology including proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, or some growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and now we believe that targeting of specific miRNAs is a powerful approach for OA management. In this study, we show the involvement of microRNA-125b-5p in regulation of several inflammatory genes including MMP-13 in human OA chondrocytes. MicroRNA-125 has highly conserved nucleic acid sequence reported in several mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In humans, it is basically found in three homologs structures hsa-miR-125a, hsa-miR-125b-1 and hsa-miR-125b-2 and the mature hsa-miR-125b-5p was derived from the pre-mature hsa-miR-125a, hsa-miR-125b-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Recently, the role of miR-125b was discovered in various cell types of different human disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. More specifically, miR-125b was reported to inhibit keratinocyte proliferation and promote their apoptosis via targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and regulates expression of MMP-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, its reduced expression was found in squamous cells of oral cancer patients, suggesting its direct role in oral cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, its abnormal expression was reported in different organs of different cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting its role in cancer. Now, the role miR-125b is well established in regulation of cancers associated genes, therefore it is presumed that cancer associated mechanisms may have its involvement. Importantly, the role of miR-125b was also reported in regulation of key inflammatory genes in different cell types, suggesting its role in inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, its role was also reported in acute chronic pulmonary disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Not only have these, miR-125b also promotes activation of macrophages, suggesting its role in immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In OA, the role of miR-125b was defined by few studies, in one study miR-125b was reported to regulate aggrecanase-1 expression in human chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and in another study, its role was defined in regulation of inflammatory activities in stimulated chondrogenic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, in one of our previous studies, using microarray analysis, we analyzed the expression of 1347 miRNAs in human OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1&#x003b2;. Out of them, 35 miRNAs were differentially expressed upon IL-1&#x003b2; stimulation and among differentially expressed miRNAs, hsa-miR125b-5p was found to be down-regulated by more than 100 folds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In view of this interesting finding and findings by the others, the present study was designed to investigate the role of hsa-miR-125b-5p in modulation of inflammatory genes relevant to OA pathogenesis. Our results show that the hsa-miR125b-5p negatively co-regulates the expression of TRAF6 through direct binding with its 3&#x02032;UTR in primary OA chondrocytes. Using microRNA database bioinformatics approach at this locus, 926 genes was found that showed sequences similar to the seed sequence of hsa-miR125b-5p. Among them, the predicted scores of binding between the hsa-miR125b-5p and TRAF6 mRNA sequence was 85, indicating strong chances of binding between them. These computer-based predictions were further re-confirmed by another bioinformatics approach. Applying targetscan algorithm, we identified that the sequence of hsa-miR-125b-5p is complementary to 3&#x02032;UTR of human TRAF6 mRNA at 1276&#x02013;1283 nucleotide sequence. Not only in human TRAF6 mRNA, similar complementary sequence was also found in the TRAF6 3&#x02032;UTR of chimpanzee, rhesus, mouse, rat, cat, dog and elephant. To prove these computer based predictions, taqman assays were used to determine the expression of hsa-miR-125b-5p and TRAF6 in OA cartilage obtained from discarded knee/hips tissues from OA patients. Taqman assays pointed out that the expression of hsa-miR-125b-5p was significantly more in smooth OA cartilage as compared to its expression in damaged OA cartilage. Whereas, the expression of TRAF6 in damaged cartilage was significantly high as compared to smooth cartilage. This inverse correlation between hsa-miR-125b-5p and TRAF6 in damaged and smooth OA cartilage may indicate that hsa-miR-125b-5p may regulates TRAF6 expression in OA cartilage. As we know chondrocytes are the only cell types of the cartilage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, therefore taqman assays specific for hsa-miR-125b-5p and TRAF6 were applied to determine their expression in chondrocytes obtained from OA cartilage. Again the same correlation between hsa-miR-125b-5p and TRAF6 was found in both sets of stimulated or unstimulated cells. However, treatment of cells with IL-1&#x003b2; remarkably increased this negative co-relation, suggesting involvement of one or more mechanisms in human OA chondrocytes with or without IL-1&#x003b2;. Earlier investigations proved that the IL-1&#x003b2; induces cartilage breakdown by altering the inflammatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In support of these, our data clearly indicate that IL-1&#x003b2; stimulates the proinflammatory mechanisms by inhibiting hsa-miR-125b-5p expression and stimulating TRAF6 mediated cell signaling which promote joints breakdown in OA. To validate the direct binding between 3&#x02032;UTR of TRAF6 mRNA and hsa-miR-125b-5p, we performed luciferase reporter assays. A noticeable inhibition in the luciferase activity was found in cells with overexpressed hsa-miR-125b-5p. Furthermore, treatment with miR-125b mimic caused significant suppression of IL-1&#x003b2; induced TRAF6 expression. These results validated that hsa-miR-125b-5p regulates the expression of TRAF6 through its 3&#x02032;UTR in human OA chondrocytes.</p><p id="Par15">The MAPKs are key inflammatory pathways associated with OA pathogenesis and IL-1&#x003b2; induced activation of MAPKs via TRAF6 was well studied in human OA chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Furthermore, involvement of MAPKs in regulation of miRNAs expression was also testified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In the present study, we show that the hsa-miR-125b-5p regulates not only p38-MAPK, but also JNK and ERK-MAPKs in chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1&#x003b2;. Treatment of chondrocytes with miR-125b mimic caused marked inhibition in the phosphorylation of all three studied MAPKs, indicating that altered expression of hsa-miR-125b-5p is regulated by MAPKs activation. The master transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B is the most studied transcription factors associated with inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

In this study, we determined inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B destabilization in the cytoplasm of the stimulated cells by the altered expression of hsa-miR-125b-5p.

Our findings showed that the treatment of cells with miR-125b mimic caused remarkable reduction of MMP-13 expression in the studied cartilage cells, suggesting an anti-inflammatory activity of hsa-miR-125b-5p on overproduction of MMP-13 in the OA.

Data show that treatment of chondrocytes with miR-125b mimic caused marked inhibition in IL-1&#x003b2;-induced secretion of number of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors which are relevant to OA pathogenesis including IL-6, IL-15, TNF-&#x003b1;, INF-&#x003b3;, IL-8, IGF-&#x003b2;1, TGF-&#x003b2;2 and IGFBP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. These interesting results further strengthen our central hypothesis that hsa-miR-125b-5p plays a key role in negative co-regulation of genes involved in the destruction of joints in OA.
