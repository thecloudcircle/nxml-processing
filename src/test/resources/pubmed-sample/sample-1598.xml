DC are furthermore believed to decode antigen context by virtue of pattern recognition receptors and to polarize T cells through cytokine secretion toward distinct effector functions. Diverse polarized T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) cells have been explored in great detail. In contrast, studies of instructing DC have to date largely been restricted to <italic>in vitro</italic> settings or adoptively transferred DC. Here we report efforts to unravel the DC response to cognate T cell encounter in antigen-challenged lymph nodes (LN). Mice engrafted with antigen-specific T cells were immunized with nanoparticles (NP) entrapping adjuvants and absorbed with antigen to study the immediate DC response to T cell encounter using bulk and single cell RNA-seq profiling. NP induced robust antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>1 cell responses with minimal bystander activation. Fluorescent-labeled NP allowed identification of antigen-carrying DC and focus on transcriptional changes in DC that encounter T cells. Our results support the existence of a bi-directional crosstalk between DC and T cells that promotes T<sub>H</sub>1 responses, including involvement of the ubiquitin-like molecule Isg15 that merits further study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DC</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>cognate interaction</kwd><kwd>immune synapsis</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">European Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000781</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="60"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="9492"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cell encounter of major histocompatibility complex peptide (MHCp) entities on dendritic cells (DC) has, depending on its context distinct outcomes. Protective T cell responses include proliferation, T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) cell polarization, and memory formation. They are believed to rely on three distinct stimuli: cognate MHCp encounter, costimulatory signals provided by B7 family members, and instructing cytokines. All three signals can be derived from DC for productive T cell priming to occur (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Furthermore, the stimuli seem to have to come from the same antigen-presenting cell (APC), because only pathogen-exposed DC can direct full T<sub>H</sub> cell differentiation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Recognition of pathogen-association of antigen by DC, therefore, seems critical for the initiation of protective T cell responses, suggesting that inflammatory mediators can amplify, but not initiate, adaptive immunity. Such a scenario ensures that information on the original context of the antigen, which is deciphered by DC through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including Toll-like receptors (TLR) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), can be relayed to T cells. DC populate lymphoid organs, i.e., spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), as well as peripheral non-lymphoid tissues, such as skin, intestine, and lung. From the latter, DC traffic via the lymphatics to the LNs, where antigen-loaded immigrant and resident DC encounter na&#x000ef;ve T cells to initiate adaptive T cell immunity (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Classical DC (cDC) comprise two main subsets, termed cDC1 and cDC2 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>XCR1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 are specialized in the stimulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). XCR1<sup>+</sup> cDC1, often also defined as CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> or CD103<sup>+</sup> DC (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), depend on the transcription factor Batf3 for their development (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). cDC1 are superior in cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens and provide a critical source for IL-12 during infection (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2 that are further defined by SIRP&#x003b1; (CD172A) surface expression, depend for their development on the transcription factors Irf4, Klf4, and Notch2 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Functional specialization of cDC2 is less well-understood, although these cells were reported to be superior in MHC-II presentation, and hence the stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Once polarized, T<sub>H</sub> cells have acquired effector functions to combat infections and malignancies and contribute to the immune defense. Aside from regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>), CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can differentiate into diverse helper T<sub>H</sub> lineages, e.g., T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, that are characterized by distinct effector cytokine profiles and specialized in control of viral, bacteria and fungal pathogens. CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTL) acquire cytotoxic activity and are critical players in the defense against in intracellular pathogens (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>It remains unclear if DC subsets harbor distinct potential for T cell polarization toward T<sub>H</sub> fates, for instance as result of distinct TLR repertoires. XCR1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 are required for protective CTL, T<sub>H</sub>1, and T<sub>H</sub>17 responses against bacterial and viral infections, as well as tumors (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), which might in part be due to superior efficiency in cross-presentation. Impairment of CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2 development or function, through Irf4, Klf4 or Notch2 deficiencies, on the other hand, was reported to compromise T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation, as well as the homeostatic generation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in mucosal tissues (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In mice exposed to <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> and the contact sensitizer di-butyl phthalate, CD11b<sup>+</sup> and double negative skin DC transcriptomes differ from the respective non-treated controls but they share minimal transcriptional similarities though the induction of the same T<sub>H</sub>2 response (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>In the DC/T cell synapse, DC trigger the T cell receptor (TCR) with MHCp and provide costimulation via CD80 and CD86. Whether the interactions with cognate T cells in turn license the DC to acquire polarization potential remains unclear. Here, we designed an experimental set up to probe for such putative DC responses to cognate T cell encounter in antigen draining LNs. Specifically, we immunized mice that had been engrafted with antigen-specific T cells (OT-I, OT-II), with nanoparticles (NP) entrapping antigen (OVA), adjuvants (CpG), and a fluorescent dye (6G rhodamine) to study the immediate DC response to T cell encounter using bulk and single cell RNA-seq profiling. Our results suggest the existence of a bi-directional crosstalk between DC and T cells to promote T<sub>H</sub>1 response that merit further exploration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Targeting Dendritic Cells by Antigen-Loaded Nanoparticles (NP)</title><p>To define and isolate antigen-presenting DC from LNs of immunized mice, we employed targeted delivery of designed polymeric aliphatic-polyester poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NP) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In their internal phase, these NP were engineered to entrap the fluorescent dye rhodamine 6G for detection and visualization and the TLR9 ligand CpG (ODN 1826) as adjuvant.

One day prior to subcutaneous (s.c.) hock immunization with NP, mice were engrafted with OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> TCR transgenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). At defined time intervals shortly after immunization, inguinal and popliteal LNs of challenged mice were isolated for analysis by ImageStream and flow cytometry. NP were found associated with DC and other cells, including B cells, plasmacytoid DC, as well as non-phagocytic cells, such as T cells, albeit in different amounts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, data not shown). LN DC that had engulfed NP could be readily visualized by ImageStream and included cDC1 and cDC2 as discriminated by CD11b expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). NP<sup>+</sup> DC comprised XCR1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 and CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2 in a reproducible ratio that was irrespective of the specific protein cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and mirrored the abundance of the subsets in the non-immunized LNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).

Here we designed an experimental system to identify transcriptomic changes in LN DC, which resulted from cognate T cell encounter. A nanoparticulate system harboring a label, antigen (OVA), and adjuvant (CpG) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) was used to induce antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>1 response in OVA-responding TCR transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (OT-II). NP were efficiently ingested by MHC II-expressing cells and induced robust antigen-specific T cell responses with minimal bystander activation. Given that this antigen-specific T cell response was abrogated in CD80/CD86 deficient mice unable to deliver costimulation, we concluded that our NP immunization challenge relied on the antigen presentation process for induction of T cells, excluding anergic activation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Whether the interactions with cognate T cells in turn license the DC to acquire polarization potential has remained unclear. T cell interactions with mature DC occur with different degrees of T cell receptor engagement and allow lasting cell surface contact between DC and T cells (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), that could play in favor of a bi-directional cross-talk between the two cell types involved. Indeed earlier reports proposed that CD40 and LT&#x003b2;R signaling provided by T cells cooperate to provide full conditioning of DC during antigen presentation (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and immune synapsis signaling could protect DC from apoptosis (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). By manipulating our experimental system, we explored the bi-directional cross-talk between DC and T cells during immune synapsis. We found that cognate interaction modulate the transcriptomic changes DC undergo following adjuvants challenge and NP uptake mostly in terms of timing and intensity/robustness. A first series of experiment aimed to define the &#x0201c;masking&#x0201d; effect of the adjuvant CpG and revealed that (antigen/adjuvant) NP led to a similar response as (adjuvant) NP in terms of transcriptome alterations, albeit with a distinct kinetics. Interestingly, removing the antigen from the challenge or the antigen-responding T cells from the experimental setup while keeping the (antigen/adjuvant) NP challenge led to similar transcriptomic alterations suggesting a signature associated with cognate interaction with T cells. The genes modulated in both experimental setups included <italic>Ccr7, Cxcl16, Flt3, Il4i1, Socs2</italic>, and <italic>Tnfrsf4</italic>. The results were further corroborated in a complementary comparison of (antigen/adjuvant) NPs carrying different antigens (OVA or BSA). Here, cognate interaction was impeded by the inability of (BSA/CpG) NP-carrying DC to interact and present antigen or by the scarcity of OVA-responding T cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>A module that seems particularly affected by the cognate T cell interaction was centered around ISG15, an ubiquitin-like protein with pleiotropic functions, induced by type I IFN (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). ISG15 is established as critical protein modifier during anti-viral responses with <italic>Isg15</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice being more susceptible to infection (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Conversely, the inactivation of ISG15-isopeptidase USP18, which results in accumulation of ISG15-conjugated substrates, increased viral resistance (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests an extra-cellular role of secreted ISG15, in addition to its role as intra-cellular protein modifier. Secreted ISG15 was shown to engage the integrin CD11a on human NK cells and trigger, potentially in synergy with IL-12, IFN&#x003b3; secretion (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Likewise, release of cysteine-reactive free ISG15 was reported to induce cDC1 recruitment to the sites of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, and induce DC secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed the recruitment of monocyte-derived DC upon cognate DC/T cell interactions. The population of monocyte-derived cells resembled earlier reported monocyte-derived DC, which were reported to contribute to T<sub>H</sub>1 responses by inducing IFN&#x003b3; and IL-2 production in T cells (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Although in that study recruitment of these cells was observed following LPS, direct CpG injection did not promote monocyte-derived DC recruitment to the LNs (probably due to low expression of TLR9 in monocytes) (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Nevertheless, our experimental setup and analysis implies the engagement of an antigen specific recognition between DC and T cells, which cannot occur with the same frequencies upon direct CpG injection alone. It remains unclear why recruitment of monocyte-like cells seems restricted to the (OVA/CpG) NP challenge, although this could be related to enhanced chemokine expression by the other DC subsets including the established monocyte attractant CXCL10 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This supports the notion that cell recruitment in our model might be related to signals released during cognate DC/T cell interactions. Our study suggests a potential role of the ISG15 module in the establishment of T<sub>H</sub>1 responses, which should be substantiated by further experimentation, including the definition of intra- and extra-cellular modes of ISG15 action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Mice aged 8&#x02013;16 weeks old were used for experiments.

RNA was captured with Dynabeads mRNA Direct Purification Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA-seq protocol for the generation of libraries is a derivation of MARS-seq (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina NexSeq-500, raw data were mapped to the genome (NCBI37/mm9) using HISAT (version 0.1.6) (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), only reads with unique mapping were considered.

Normalization and differential expression analysis were done using the DESeq2 R-package (Bioconductor, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).

(<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), cells were single-cell sorted into 384-well cell capture plates containing 2 &#x003bc;L of lysis solution and barcoded poly(T) reverse-transcription (RT) primers. Immediately after sorting, each plate was spun down to ensure cell immersion into the lysis solution, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until processed. mRNA from cell sorted into cell capture plates are converted into cDNA and pooled using an automated pipeline. The pooled sample is then linearly amplified by T7 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, and the resulting RNA is fragmented and converted into a sequencing-ready library by tagging the samples with pool barcodes and Illumina sequences during ligation, RT, and PCR. Each pool of cells was tested for library quality and concentration was assessed. All RNA-Seq libraries (pooled at equimolar concentration) were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500. Sequences were mapped to mouse genome (mm9), demultiplexed, and filtered as previously described (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), extracting a set of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) that define distinct transcripts in single cells for further processing. Mapping of reads was done using HISAT (version 0.1.6) (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>); reads with multiple mapping positions were excluded. Reads were associated with genes if they were mapped to an exon, using the UCSC genome browser for reference. Exons of different genes that shared genomic position on the same strand were considered a single gene with a concatenated gene symbol.</p></sec><sec><title>Filtering and Data Analysis of scRNA-Seq</title><p>Expression matrices from the four plates (two of BSA and two of OVA) were imported to a Seurat object (Seurat R Package (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>); version 2.3.4), with minimal filtering criteria (min.cells = 5,min.genes = 300). Additional filtering of cells with high or low UMI or gene counts (below 5% value or above 95%) with the function FilterCells. Data was normalized and log transformed, scaled with regression [vars.to.regress = c(&#x0201c;nUMI&#x0201d;,&#x0201c;nGene&#x0201d;)].

Next, we performed a principal components analysis, and 8 significant principal components were used as input for FindClusters (resolution = 0.6). We used tSNE for two-dimensional visualization of the multi-dimensional dataset. Differential expression of the individual clusters was achieved using FindAllMarkers(only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25). Gene Average expression per cluster was extracted with the function AverageExpression (uses normalized log values). One hundred and eighteen highly differentially expressed genes by (OVA/CpG) NP+ DC and (BSA/CpG) NP+ DC, were detected with fdr &#x0003c; = 0.05 using function FindMarkers with multiple statistical tests (MAST, poisson, negbinom, and bimod).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animals were on a C57BL/6JOlaHsd background, maintained in specific-pathogen-free conditions and handled according to protocols approved by the Weizmann Institute Animal Care Committee (IACUC), as per international guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>CC designed and performed experiments.
