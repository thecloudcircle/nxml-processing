Current treatments produce variable rates of treatment failure and toxicity without sterile cure, rendering treatment efficacy monitoring essential. To avoid repeated invasive tissue aspirates as well as empirical treatment, there is a need for new tools that allow a less-invasive and early assessment of treatment efficacy in the field. Cross-sectional studies have suggested levels of cytokines/chemokines after whole blood stimulation as good markers of cure, but longitudinal studies are lacking. In this study, we followed 13 active VL cases in an endemic area in Ethiopia by measuring the production of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IP-10, IL-2, IL-10, MCP-1, and MIG before, during, and at the end of treatment. After 24 hours of stimulation of whole blood with soluble <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigen, we observed an early, robust, and incremental increase of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, and IP-10 levels in all patients during treatment. Moreover, based on the IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> levels that showed an average 13-fold increase from the time of diagnosis until the end of treatment, we could almost perfectly discriminate active from cured status. Similar concentrations and patterns were found in stimulation assays with the two main <italic>Leishmania</italic> species. The levels of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, IP-10, or TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> also seemed to be inversely associated with the parasite load at baseline. Despite a 1/10 drop in concentrations, similar patterns were observed in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and IP-10 levels when dried plasma spots were stored at 4&#x000b0;C for an average of 225 days. All the above evidence suggests a detectable restoration of cell-mediated immunity in VL and its association with parasite clearance. With a potential application in rural settings by means of dried plasma spots, we recommend to further explore the early diagnostic value of such assays for treatment efficacy monitoring in large cohort studies including treatment failure cases.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>European Regional Development Fund</funding-source><award-id>RD16CIII/0003/0002</award-id><award-id>RD16/0027/0017</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</funding-source><award-id>PI18CIII/00029</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>DGDC</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>ITM</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected vector-borne protozoan disease, prevalent in the tropics, subtropics, and Mediterranean basin. It is responsible for an estimated 50,000-90,000 annual cases globally and lethal if left untreated [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over 90% of the cases are concentrated in Bangladesh, India, Brazil, Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is characterized by persistent low-grade fever, weight loss, anemia, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, edema, muscle wasting, diarrhea, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Through time, it may cause bleeding due to thrombocytopenia which may progress to sepsis and severe cachexia [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The limited range of drugs currently used for treatment includes pentavalent antimonials, pentamidine, amphotericin B deoxycholate and its lipid formulations, miltefosine, and paromomycin. However, they all produce considerable but variable rates of treatment failure (10-59%) and sterile cure is almost never achieved [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Due to the latter, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines &#x0201c;true cure&#x0201d; as a patient with no relapse episode in 3-6 months after treatment stop. In addition, the treatments are lengthy, have a high toxicity with regular side effects, and are often expensive [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Taken together, the need to monitor drug efficacy is paramount.</p><p>Considering the lack of comparable alternatives, WHO recommends a splenic, bone marrow or lymph node aspirate as a test for diagnosis but also as a test of cure [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, patients are often discharged purely following improvement of clinical signs in more rural settings, due to the need of an experienced health worker to perform the procedure or bleeding risk. To avoid repeated invasive tissue aspirates as well as empirical treatment, there is a need for quick, easy-to-use, and sensitive tools that allow a less-invasive assessment of treatment efficacy. Such tools could aid clinicians in making decisions about the continuation or change of treatment regimens. Moreover, markers able to identify the initiation of a successful treatment might help to shorten the treatment duration.</p><p>Serological techniques cannot be used for this purpose as antibodies remain high for several years. Molecular techniques seem promising, but could be less suitable as the parasitic load mostly decreases steeply after two days of treatment and gives no information on the host's immunological recovery [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Following the latter, one of the key immunological characteristics of active disease is a profound immunosuppression and impaired production of interferon-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> (IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>) and associated cytokines. Activation of infected macrophages by IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> triggers the production of nitric <italic>oxide synthases</italic>/reactive oxygen species (NOS/ROS) that facilitates parasite killing, indicating the importance of cellular sources of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The host's <italic>Leishmania</italic>-specific cell-mediated immunity is thus a key determinant in resistance and clearance of a <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection and could serve as a proxy measurement of the host's capacity to maintain future recrudescence or to resist reinfections of <italic>Leishmania</italic> as it is known to last for several years [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, techniques such as the whole blood stimulation assay (WBA) which measures the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-mediated immune response after stimulation with soluble <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens have been proposed to monitor disease recovery [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recent findings in cross-sectional studies of Ethiopia, Spain, and Bangladesh further enforced the idea that gradual increases in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> or in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-induced protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10), monokine induced by IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> (MIG or CXCL9), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1 or CCL2) levels in soluble <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigen- (SLA-) stimulated whole blood could indicate that treatment has been successful and could be targeted as biomarkers of clinical cure in VL [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The search for a robust marker is still ongoing, as different cytokines and chemokines have been proposed, but vary by geographical area, <italic>Leishmania</italic> strain, and outcome identification (asymptomatic, active, cured). To date, this assay has never been evaluated longitudinally to monitor individual <italic>L. donovani</italic>-infected patients during the course of treatment. And only one cross-sectional study reported on its value in the East African <italic>L. donovani</italic> setting, which was restricted to the IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and interleukin- (IL-) 10 analytes. In remote regions, a simpler storage and transportation method would be highly needed. Protein Saver 903 cards have shown potential as an alternative method for transporting SLA-stimulated plasma samples, even at ambient temperature, for the later analysis of IL-2, IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, IP-10, MIG, and MCP-1 concentrations [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The main aim of this pilot study was to further validate the usefulness of this assay as a treatment efficacy monitoring tool in Ethiopian VL patients by means of a first-in-its-kind longitudinal evaluation of individual patients during the course of treatment. To further fine-tune the development and implementation of a WBA in research and clinical activities among VL patients in East Africa, we also assessed strain specificity, a more field-adapted method, and demonstrated the value of seven previously proposed cytokine/chemokine markers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>An institutional-based cohort study was conducted from March to September 2018 in which a total of 21 VL patients were recruited at time of diagnosis (referred to as day zero (D0)). A 2&#x02009;ml venous blood sample was collected in a lithium-heparin tube at D0, after the first week of the treatment (W1), and at end of treatment (EOT). Sociodemographic data was collected by questionnaire and clinical data was collected from the patient's medical record by using a case report format. One patient died during treatment because he suffered from acute kidney injury and anemia. In addition, three were lost to follow-up during treatment and four had a missing time point. Therefore, a total of 13 VL patients with complete follow-up during treatment was included in the main analyses. A total of 19 VL patients were used for baseline analyses.</p><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of the School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, and the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine. All study participants provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Population</title><p>Patients were recruited and followed at the Leishmaniasis Research and Treatment Centre (LRTC) at the University of Gondar, Ethiopia. The center is located in the northwestern part of Ethiopia close to the high VL-endemic areas along the border with Sudan. Only microscopically confirmed VL cases (by the spleen or bone marrow aspiration) were included in the study. Patients with a concurrent medical emergency (unconscious and severely ill individuals), documented coinfection (tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and helminthic infection), records of any immune suppressive drugs, or who were younger than 18 or older than 65 years were considered noneligible.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Operational Definitions</title><p>Body mass index (BMI) was defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and the following criteria were used: underweight (BMI &#x0003c; 18.5&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and normal or healthy weight (BMI within the range of 18.5-25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Fever was considered if the body temperature was above 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Cure from leishmaniasis was defined at clinical discharge based on the absence of clinical signs or if a repeated splenic or bone marrow aspirate was taken, negative microscopy at end of treatment [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Following WHO guidelines, seven of the 13 VL patients (54%) confirmed &#x0201c;true cure&#x0201d; status at six months after therapy and six patients were lost to follow-up.</p><p>After splenic/bone marrow aspiration, parasites were detected with standard Giemsa staining. The parasite density score was determined using a logarithmic scale ranging from 0 (no parasites per 1000 oil immersion fields), 1+ (1&#x02013;10 parasites per 1000 fields), 2+ (1&#x02013;10 parasites per 100 fields), 3+ (1&#x02013;10 parasites per 10 fields), 4+ (1&#x02013;10 parasites per field), 5+ (10&#x02013;100 parasites per field) to +6 (&#x0003e;100 parasites per field) [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Preparation of Soluble <italic>Leishmania</italic> Antigen (SLA)</title><p>
<italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. infantum</italic> antigens were prepared from promastigote cultures in the stationary phase (S-698 strain MHOM/ET/67/HU3 and JPC strain MCAN/ES/98/LLM-722, respectively) as previously described [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The parasites were first washed with 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 1000&#x02009;g for 20&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (50&#x02009;mM Tris/5&#x02009;mM EDTA/HCl, pH 7). These samples were subjected to three cycles of freezing/thawing and then sonicated three times (40&#x02009;W for 20&#x02009;s) before being centrifuged again at 27,000&#x02009;g for 20&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 100,000&#x02009;g for 4 hours at 4&#x000b0;C, to remove the membrane antigens. Finally, the supernatants were divided into aliquots and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. The protein content was quantified following the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA), using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Whole Blood Stimulation Assay (WBA)</title><p>Whole blood samples were stimulated as previously described [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, for each sample, an aliquot of 500&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l blood was transferred in a control tube (unstimulated), two tubes containing 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml SLA from <italic>L. donovani</italic> and 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml SLA from <italic>L. infantum</italic>, and a positive control tube with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The latter and SLA of both species were lyophilized for utility and preservation in the field. Next, all of tubes were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02009;h. After incubation time, the supernatants were collected and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until cytokine/chemokine determination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Storage of Stimulated Plasma Samples in Filter Paper</title><p>In parallel with freezing down stimulated plasma, 40&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l was dropped onto two premarked 1.2&#x02009;cm diameter circles on separate Protein Saver 903 cards (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) and dried for 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;h at ambient temperature (AT) in a horizontal position on the bench to produce dried plasma spots (DPS). The cards were then placed in zip-lock plastic bags (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) containing a desiccant and maintained at 4&#x000b0;C up to 8 months.</p><p>After this period, a biopsy punch (Integra Miltex, NY, USA) was used to cut out two discs from the cards of each patient. The discs were placed in the 96-well plate and 70&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of the elution buffer (2% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS 1X) was added.

Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Assay</title><p>Levels of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IP-10, IL-2, IL-10, MIG, and MCP-1 were quantified in frozen plasma and DPS-elucidated sample from control and SLA-stimulated and PHA-stimulated whole blood using the BD Cytometric Bead Array Human Flex Set (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of the plasma of each patient was incubated for 1&#x02009;h at ambient temperature with 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of capture beads. After incubation, 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of the detection antibody was added and the mixture was placed 2 hours at ambient temperature. Data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analysed using the Flow Cytometric Analysis Program Array (BD Biosciences, USA) by manual clustering. Cytokines and chemokine concentrations (expressed in pg/ml) produced in response to SLA or PHA stimulation were determined by subtracting background levels measured in the negative control samples (nonstimulated tube).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>2.8. Data Analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism v6.0 software (GraphPad Software, USA). Continuous data was presented as the median with interquartile ranges (IQR) and the normality of data was checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The concentrations of analytes before and after treatment were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The cut-off values for each cytokine and chemokine shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> were determined by calculating the optimal point in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for discriminating active disease from cured status. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between baseline parasite load and cytokine/chemokine concentrations or <italic>L. infantum</italic>- and <italic>L. donovani</italic>-stimulated cytokine levels. A <italic>p</italic> value &#x02264; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1.

It is important to highlight that the levels of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-2, and IL-10 after elution of filter paper were below the detection limit of the technique, and that MIG and MCP-1 values after elution of the filter paper were also on the low side and, in comparison with frozen plasma, lacking a defined pattern across the different time points of the study.

This inverse relationship suggests that a recovery in cytokine/chemokine production after SLA stimulation could be used as a proxy for parasite reduction at end of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In this small but unique cohort study of primary VL cases, 13 Ethiopian patients with successful treatment all showed a steep and incremental restoration of cellular IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> production upon <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with soluble <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens during treatment. This reflected a detectable restoration of the profound immunosuppression previously reported in active VL patients [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite being in contrast with a previous cross-sectional study in India where no statistically significant differences were found after quantification of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> levels between active and cured VL patients [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], our results consolidated the findings of the sole East African report. The latter reported on an incremental increase in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> levels in cured individuals living in Northwest Ethiopia as compared to active patients but could not detect differences in IL-10 levels. Similar findings were reported in Turkish, Indian, Iranian, Spanish, and Bangladeshi VL patients [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], indicating a typical cellular hyporesponsiveness during active disease that restores after successful therapy, as was also reported in studies using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). This was also reflected in the gradual increase in nonspecific PHA stimulation which suggests a broad mechanism of immunosuppression that merits further investigation. Studies in Spain and Ethiopia demonstrated that a long-lasting memory response remains in cured patients and increased levels of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) could be detected in almost all patients at 6 and 12 months after treatment [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This is, however, the first time that a longitudinal study in diseased individuals was performed with an early measurement at one week of treatment. It showed an early almost dose-response-like rate of recovery with 9 to 13-fold increases in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, IP-10, or TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> levels after therapy (EOT).</p><p>Due to the sharp 13-fold increase in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> levels during treatment, it was almost possible to perfectly discriminate between diseased (D0) and cured (EOT) status. Although we did not have splenic parasite counts at end of treatment, the levels of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, IP-10, or TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> seemed to be inversely associated with the parasite load at baseline and therefore could reflect parasite clearance. This further argues for the development and validation of this assay as an alternative test of cure in larger cohort studies including treatment failure cases to establish its prognostic and diagnostic value in early to late stages of the treatment.</p><p>Because IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> is produced in rather low quantities, other IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-associated cytokines and chemokines have been proposed to show better performance. The production of IP-10 has a role in the host response to VL by initiation of early immune responses and further increasing the production of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, which indirectly promotes killing of the intracellular parasite [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, plasma concentrations of IP-10 after SLA stimulation were also significantly increased during successful treatment, but not as robustly in all individual patients as IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> or TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>. A previous study also showed IP-10 as an accurate global marker of infection and cure [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We found similar results for TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> levels during treatment. TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> has an indirect role for parasite clearance by stimulating the production of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>. Previously, a significantly elevated production of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> was also observed in VL-cured solid organ transplant subjects and VL-cured individuals from Spain after 6 months of treatment [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Even though Th1 cell-mediated immunity for parasite control is associated with production of IL-2 by activated T cells [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], it was produced at much lower concentration and there was no significant production of IL-2 during treatment but only at the end of treatment. In previous studies, its concentration was also below detection limit during active infection while cured individuals were able to produce a significant concentration of this cytokine [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This suggests that production of IL-2 is rather a late signature of cure.</p><p>High levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 have been associated with the depressed cell-mediated immunity (CMI) during active VL, and PBMC-based assays have showed elevated production of this cytokine during active infections that decreased over time [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, we observed no changes in IL-10 levels during treatment which was also reported by Adem et al. in a very similar patient population [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These challenge the common dogma in PBMC assays or point towards other sources of IL-10. In a similar manner, our findings showed no specific pattern for MIG levels during treatment with SLA or PHA stimulation, although a previous study in Spain reported MIG to be a good biomarker of cure in <italic>L. infantum-</italic>infected individuals [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>A similar whole blood interferon-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> release assay is being used in tuberculosis patients to identify specific immunity during latent infection (commercialized as QuantiFERON&#x000ae;) [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The <italic>Leishmania</italic>-specific whole blood stimulation assay has also been evaluated in different endemic areas of <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. for the detection of subjects with asymptomatic infection [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, specificity problems of the soluble <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens used, in particular cross-reactivity with similar pathogens like <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, could be problematic when targeting a diagnostic or predictive tool in coendemic countries, which may be of lesser concern for its development as a test-of-cure. Field applicability is also important when testing for asymptomatic infection in the rural settings of endemic areas. We found comparable patterns in cytokine/chemokine expressions of frozen plasma and dried plasma spots that were stored at 4&#x000b0;C for up to 8 months and shipped at ambient temperature. Similar results were also obtained on negative control subjects and asymptomatic individuals from Spain and Bangladesh, where the samples stored for 10 days at ambient temperature or -20&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This indicates that an adapted version of the WBA with dry stimulated plasma spots instead of frozen supernatants could be developed for the rural less-equipped health centers, thereby avoiding a cold-chain transport and decreasing the cost of transport to reference centers. Despite a loss in quantity, the ratio between D0 and EOT remained identical by which a pretest-posttest would be advised. In addition, no significant differences in cytokine/chemokine expressions between SLA from <italic>L. infantum</italic> and SLA from <italic>L. donovani</italic> stimulation were observed. Similar results were reported in studies determining the CMI at endemic areas for <italic>L. infantum</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic> [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This suggests that many immunodominant antigens are shared across the species and a global assay could be developed [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Despite a number of inherent and important limitations such as the lack of treatment failure cases, low number of individuals, and lack of long-term follow-up after treatment stop, we believe these findings can spur and steer larger cohort studies to evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic value as a treatment monitoring tool.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>This pilot study indicated a detectable restoration of cell-mediated immunity against VL that could be used to follow up treatment efficacy and enable better patient management. This longitudinal pilot study showed that IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> had a steady and on average 13-fold increase from time of diagnosis until end of treatment in successfully treated VL patients and would be the recommended analyte out of a panel of 7 previously proposed markers to be prioritized. We hope the recommendations in this work on the use of WBA in combination with filter paper will facilitate treatment monitoring studies of more VL patients in the search for an alternative less-invasive test-of-cure. In particular, an early marker of treatment efficacy would be highly warranted to limit the duration or steer the chemotherapeutic choice of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to say our words of gratitude to study participants, for their willingness to be a part of this study.
