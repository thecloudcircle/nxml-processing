Studies have shown that neurons in the hypothalamus are involved in RWIS, but the role of astrocytes and the interactions between astrocytes and neurons in RWIS are not clear. Here, we tested our hypothesis that hypothalamus astrocytes are involved in RWIS and interact with neurons to regulate gastric mucosal damage induced by RWIS. The expression of Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and c-Fos in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) significantly increased following the RWIS. GFAP and c-Fos expression are similar in the temporal pattern, peaked at 1 h after the RWIS, then reduced gradually, and reached a maximal level again at 5 h which show &#x0201c;double-peak&#x0201d; characteristics. Intracerebroventricular administration of astroglial toxin L-a-aminoadipate (L-AA) and c-Fos antisense oligodeoxy nucleotides (ASO) both decreased RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage. Results of immunohistochemistry assay revealed that both L-AA and ASO decreased the activation of astrocytes and neurons in the hypothalamus by RWIS. These results showed that hypothalamus neuron-astrocyte &#x0201c;network&#x0201d; involved in gastric mucosal damage induced by RWIS. This study may offer theoretical basis for some novel therapeutic strategies for RWIS-induced gastric ulcers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>gastric mucosal damage</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">31672286</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="5935"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Restraint water-immersion stress (RWIS) in rats can imitate clinical gastric lesions caused by wounds, surgery or sepsis. Therefore, RWIS is often used to study the etiopathogenesis of stress-induced gastric mucosal damage (Ai and Zhang, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Ephgrave et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Gastric function is primarily controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system through the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV; Andrews and Sanger, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Hayakawa et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) are the most prominent nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus and may be stimulus-dependent (Palkovits, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Briski and Gillen, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Functional and anatomical connections among PVN neurons, the lower brainstem and spinal cord have been established. Parvocellular oxytocin (OT) cells in the PVN project mainly to the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS), the DMV and the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord (Kannan and Yamashita, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Luiten et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). These neurons are believed to play a major role in gastric reflexes.</p><p>Astrocytes are the most numerous neuroglial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the last few decades, evidence from a series of studies has demonstrated that astrocytes and neurons share transporters and receptors, and astrocytes influence synaptic signaling as well as synchronizing neuronal activity and calcium dynamics by releasing gliotransmitters (Lavialle et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Most of the research on the neurobiology of stress has been exclusively focused on neurons (Hayakawa et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Furlong et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, recent findings suggested that astrocytes can directly sense and eventually change their morphology or functionality in response to the stress (Young et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kirby et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Our study has reported that astrocytes in the brainstem are involved in RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage (Sun et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Due to the close relationship between the hypothalamus and brainstem in structure and function, it is possible that hypothalamus astrocytes participate in RWIS or interact with neurons to regulate gastric mucosal damage induced by the RWIS model.</p><p>c-Fos has been used as a functional anatomical mapping tool to identify cells and serves as a marker of neuronal activity (Furlong et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Astrocytes have the potential to play important roles in various physiological or noxious stimuli with increased Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. Therefore, GFAP is commonly used as an astrocytic activation marker (Takahashi et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Sechi et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). L-a-aminoadipate (L-AA) is used to deactivate astrocytes based on the fact that disruption of the astrocytic network in the amygdala is confined to astrocytes (Khurgel et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A c-Fos antisense oligodeoxy nucleotides (ASO) was observed when a c-Fos protein product was knocked down (Lee et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Therefore, L-AA and ASO were employed in this study to shut down activated astrocytes and hypothalamus neurons, respectively.</p><p>In this study, we examined the time course of astrocyte and neuron activation in the PVN and SON along with RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage by using GFAP and c-Fos expression, respectively. In addition, the potential &#x0201c;network&#x0201d; between astrocytes and neurons was investigated with intracerebroventricular injection of L-AA or c-Fos ASO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preparation of Animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats weighing 220&#x02013;250 g were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Shandong University.

All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain (Zimmermann, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) and approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Shandong Normal University (Jinan, China).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stress Protocols</title><p>The animals were randomly divided into six groups according to the duration of RWIS: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h (<italic>n</italic> = 6 per group). The rats were lightly anesthetized by ether inhalation and the limbs of each rat were bound gently and securely on a wooden plate using medical adhesive tape. After the rats regained consciousness, they were vertically immersed in water maintained at 21&#x000b0;C to the level of the xiphoid for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h. Rats in the control group were neither bound to the wooden board nor immersed in water. The experiment was performed between 8:00 and 13:00 to decrease the effect of diurnal variations on GFAP and c-Fos expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Administration of Drugs</title><p>The phosphorothioate-modified c-Fos ASO and the L-AA were obtained from Sangon Biotechnology Co. (Shanghai, China) and Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively. The rats were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) ASO group with c-Fos ASO (50 &#x003bc;g dissolved in 10 &#x003bc;l saline,) injected into the lateral ventricle (<italic>n</italic> = 6); (2) L-AA group with an intracerebroventricular injection of L-AA at a dose of 100 nmol in 10 &#x003bc;l saline; and (3) Saline group with an intracerebroventricular administration of normal saline (NS, 10 &#x003bc;l, <italic>n</italic> = 6). Stereotaxic coordinates were: 0.8 mm posterior, 1.8 mm right lateral to the Bregma, and 3.8 mm ventral from the Bregma, according to the Paxinos and Watson&#x02019;s brain atlas. For each injection, the solution was slowly injected within 5 min. The needle was kept in place for 5 min to lower pressure inside the tube. The rats received the injection and then were stressed with RWIS for 1 h. Because expression of GFAP and c-Fos peaked at 1 h of RWIS, the 1 h RWIS time point was used for the drug experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Tissue Preparation</title><p>At the end of the experiments, the rats were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium and perfused through the left cardiac ventricle with approximately 200 ml 0.01 mol/L phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by approximately 300 ml 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4). The brain was removed after the end of perfusion and post-fixed at 4&#x000b0;C for 4 h.

The GAFP-immunoreactive (GAFP-IR) and c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-IR) sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with mouse anti-GFAP (1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) and rabbit anti-Fos (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), respectively. After washing the samples three times with PBS for 10 min, the sections were incubated for 1 h in the secondary antibodies at RT. The specificities of the staining were tested on the sections in the second dish by omitting the primary antibodies. No immunoreactive outcomes were found on the sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Evaluation of Gastric Mucosal Damage</title><p>The rats were sacrificed after the stress protocols were completed. Their stomachs were removed and incised along the greater curvature of stomach, then rinsed with normal saline. Gastric mucosal lesions were identified with a magnifying lens. The erosion index (EI) was measured according to the methods of Guth (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Scores were made according to the length of the lesion: the length &#x02264;1 mm as 1 score, 1 mm &#x0003c; the length &#x02264;2 mm as 2 score, and the others were deduced in turn. The score was multiplied by 2 when the width of the lesion was larger than 1 mm. The cumulative scores of all lesions in a rat served as the EI of the rat.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Evaluation of Immunostaining</title><p>Brain sections were observed under identical conditions with a BX51 Olympus microscope (Olympus Corporation, Japan). The nomenclature and nuclear boundaries defined in the rat brain stereotaxic atlas of Paxinos and Watson (Picciotto and Kenny, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) were used. For quantitative assessment, Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics Inc, Rockville, MD, USA) was used to quantify GFAP-IR astrocytes and the c-Fos expression in PVN and SON. The pictures taken of GFAP-IR astrocytes were magnified 200 times, and pictures taken of the c-Fos-IR neurons were magnified 100 times. GFAP-positive astrocytes and c-Fos positive neurons were counted in the hypothalamus (PVN and SON) during RWIS. The number of immunoreactive astrocytes and neurons were counted from three inconsecutive sections per animal, and the average values of the immunoreactive astrocytes and neurons in 0.01 mm<sup>2</sup> were reported as the measure of immunoreactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All of the values were reported as the mean &#x000b1; SEM.

However, the mechanism underlying this damage is far from clear. In this study, we assessed hypothalamic astrocytes involved in RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage in rats and examined interactions with hypothalamic neurons during this process. In this study, the main findings were that astrocytes and neurons in the hypothalamus (PVN and SON) are involved in the effect of stress on gastrointestinal function, inhibiting either neuronal or astrocytic activity in the hypothalamus prevented RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage, and a neuron-astrocyte interaction in the hypothalamus occurs under RWIS conditions.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>RWIS Enhanced Neuronal and Astrocytic Activations in the Hypothalamus</title><p>The PVN and SON in the hypothalamus are two of the most important nuclei and are fundamental in homeostatic regulation. Prior studies suggest phenotypic changes occur in the hypothalamus (PVN and/or SON) in response to acute and chronic stress, including elevations in vasopressin (VP) and OT and/or corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) gene expression (Aguilera et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Blume et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Alterations of gene expression in the PVN and SON have important functional roles in the regulation of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) and the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis during stress. Acute and chronic stress may lead to changes in the VP and OT signature and be connected to the amount of neuroendocrinological disturbances (Al-Barazanji et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). These changes may lead to the dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system under many conditions. The large magnocellular neurons in the PVN and SON produce mainly VP and OT as neurotransmitters, which have connections to gastric functions (Flanagan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Lu et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, immunohistochemical assays of c-Fos expression suggested there was higher c-Fos immunoreactivity in the PVN and SON in the stressed rats compared to the control group. The non-stressed basal conditions do not significantly increase c-Fos expression and show no c-Fos positive cells or scattered immunoreactive cells. The result is consistent with a previous study that indicated that restraint stress caused c-Fos expression in the hypothalamus (Amemiya et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Pace et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). After RWIS, neurons were activated in PVN and SON and indicated that PVN and SON might be involved in gastric dysfunction induced by RWIS, such as gastric hypermotility, and contribute to stress-induced gastric mucosa damage.</p><p>Meanwhile, we found that the time course of c-Fos expression induced by RWIS was different from expression in other observations. Acute challenge leads to c-Fos expression within a few minutes and peaks between 30 and 60 min. The maximal amount of c-Fos protein occurs between 1 h and 3 h then gradually decreases from the cell nucleus by 4&#x02013;6 h after stimuli (Sawchenko et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Zi&#x000f3;&#x00142;kowska et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These results were consistent with our previous observations that the peak of stress-induced c-Fos expression in the brainstem occurred at 1 h after the RWIS and decreased following stress at 2&#x02013;5 h (Sun et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Yet our present results show that the c-Fos expression in the PVN and SON peaked at 1 h after the RWIS then reduced gradually at 2&#x02013;3 h before reaching a maximal level again at 5 h, which suggests a biphasic pattern of immunoreactivity. This indicted that the c-Fos expression spatial patterns during RWIS may be different between the brainstem and the hypothalamus.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the early wave of c-Fos expression is part of a rapid pulse of increased gene transcription involving a broad functional repertoire of molecules, including transcription factors, growth factors and signal transduction molecules (Lanahan and Worley, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) acting as a response to exogenous stimulation that are involved in the growth and differentiation of neurons and the modulation of repair after injury. The second peak of c-Fos expression induced by RWIS is unexpected. There are studies demonstrating that a delayed expression of c-Fos occurred after a single challenge (Bing et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), that a peak of c-Fos expression appeared in 4&#x02013;7 days in the brain and was connected with excitotoxic cell death (Smeyne et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) and that the biphasic induction of c-Fos expression was caused by diffuse brain injury (Zheng et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Much of the previous research implies that transient c-Fos expression is induced by acute challenges and is not occurring in response to chronic stress. Later studies showed that c-Fos positive neurons were persistently detected in the SON and PVN of rats after drinking a hypertonic NaCl solution instead of water (Miyata et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), which suggests that chronic stress led to sustained c-Fos expression. It is possible that persistent c-Fos expression after chronic stress incorporates neural components as well as large and gradual changes in the response of those components to stimuli during development and/or neuronal plasticity (Miyata et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). In agreement with these prior results, ongoing plasticity through late expression of &#x0201c;plasticity genes&#x0201d;, such as c-Fos, can increase the capacity to process and store information (Fusi and Abbott, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the second wave of c-Fos expression may increase the transcription of other genes such as AVP or the OT gene and be associated with an event such as RWIS. Numerous pioneering studies showed the SON and PVN involved in neurosecretory and autonomic control had a highly intact neuro-glial microenvironment in which a single astrocyte can encompass thousands of synapses and allow for direct interaction with neurons. Therefore, astrocytes act as an important partner with neurons by regulating neuron-neuron interactions as well as neuronal synaptic transmissions and plasticity. However, the neuro-glial microenvironment undergoes an impressive structural remodeling in response to a variety of stimuli (Oliet et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Tasker et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). There is substantial evidence that chronic and acute stress can induce changes in the morphology and function of astrocytes, which may impair brain function and ultimately form part of the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders (Feng et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Therefore, it is important to think about the role that astrocyte-induced plasticity may play in the behavioral sequelae of stress. Some studies of chronic stress models showed that antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine and clomipramine prevent stress-induced astrocyte changes and might normalize stress-induced behavioral changes (Cz&#x000e9;h et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Shen et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, the astrocytes within the PVN and SON implicated in RWIS were not investigated prior to the current study.</p><p>In recent years, it has been demonstrated that GFAP is expressed mainly in astrocytes and is a valuable marker for these cells because it is absent in neurons (Verwer et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Upregulation of GFAP expression in response to stimulation can be studied with an immunocytochemical method (Armstrong et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In this study, we observed RWIS-induced GFAP expression in some astrocytes in the PVN and SON. For the different durations of RWIS (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 h), robust GFAP expression in the PVN and SON showed a double-peak characteristic in which expression peaked at 1 h after RWIS then reduced and reached a maximal level again at 4&#x02013;5 h, These results suggest that a hypothalamic neuron-astrocyte network exists and plays a role in RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Interactions of Neurons and Astrocytes Contribute to RWIS-Induced Gastric Mucosal Damage</title><p>The number and/or function of astrocytes would affect the integrity, activity and behavioral output of a neuron-astrocyte network (Seifert et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Halassa et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, astrocytes cannot directly generate action potentials alone. Our hypothesis is that the activated astrocytes and neurons interact to contribute to the gastric mucosal damage after RWIS.</p><p>To test the hypothesis, it was necessary to downregulate the activated neurons or astrocytes to show how they contributed to the gastric mucosal damage. In this study, an intracerebroventricular injection of c-Fos ASO or L-AA, respectively, was used to inhibit activated neurons or astrocytes in the PVN and SON induced by the RWIS. Decreased expression of c-Fos or GFAP was accompanied by an early stage RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage. Notably, we observed that c-Fos ASO suppressed astrocytic activation after RWIS. It is also interesting to note that the astroglial toxin L-AA not only inhibited the GFAP expression but also blocked the c-Fos expression, which suggests that RWIS activates astroglial cells and releases unknown factors, which may modulate the activity of neurons in RWIS. Our results showed RWIS-induced c-Fos expression, which indicates a heightened activity of neurons within the PVN and SON. Moreover, activated neurons release a variety of neurotransmitters that activate astrocytes. Activated astrocytes also produce gliotransmitters (i.e., ATP) that have an important role in information processing and influence neuronal activity in the SON/PVN, which contributes to RWIS-induced gastric mucosal damage.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that hypothalamic astrocytes were activated and interacted with neuronal activation in response to RWIS-induced damage. Breaking this &#x0201c;neuron-astrocyte&#x0201d; interaction may help to develop novel gastric ulcer therapeutic strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>HS, RL and XM: conception and design of the experiments.
