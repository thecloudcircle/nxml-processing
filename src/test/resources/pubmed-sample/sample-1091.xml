<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Less studied is the impact of exogenous factors such as dramatic societal events&#x02014;including politics&#x02014;on the mental health of training physicians. On one hand, the busy day-to-day life of training physicians may make them impervious to such factors. Alternatively, high baseline levels of stress at work may lead to less resilience and large swings in emotions during turbulent events.</p><p>In the current era, the 2016 US presidential election stands out as a singular political event. Although doctors have traditionally sought to keep politics and medicine separate, changing demographics in medicine and growing debate around issues such as healthcare reform and women&#x02019;s reproductive health have made intersections between medicine and politics increasingly unavoidable.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

Finally, to globally assess whether there was a systematic difference between political and non-political events on their effects on mood, we ran a general linear regression with the absolute value of mood change score for each of the 17 events as the outcome with the political/non-political nature of each included as a covariate.

following six of the nine political events. The largest decline in mood was observed after the 2016 presidential election (mean mood change &#x02212;0.32, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.45 to &#x02212;0.19, t=&#x02212;4.73, P&#x0003c;0.001), with statistically significant declines in mood also following the January 2017 inauguration (mean mood change &#x02212;0.25, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.37 to &#x02212;0.12, t=-3.93, P=0.001), the ban on travel from Muslim majority countries (mean mood change &#x02212;0.21, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.34 to &#x02212;0.07, t=&#x02212;3.07, P=0.002), and Supreme Court confirmation hearings in September 2018 (mean mood change &#x02212;0.06, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.12 to &#x02212;0.01, t=&#x02212;2.35, P=0.02) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). We identified statistically significant increases in mood following the signing of a US presidential executive order designed to keep migrant families together at the US Mexico border (mean mood change 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.30, t=2.10, P=0.04) and the failure to pass a federal spending bill that included funding for a border wall (mean mood change 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.23, t=5.28, P&#x0003c;0.001). As a reference and to place these changes in context, the change in mood score associated with the start of internship duties in July was &#x02212;0.30 (95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.33 to &#x02212;0.27, t=&#x02212;17.45, P&#x0003c;0.001) for our overall sample. Among those subjects who developed depression during internship, the change in mood score was &#x02212;0.81 (95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.88 to &#x02212;0.75, t=&#x02212;23.81, P&#x0003c;0.001). These findings suggest some of the changes reported above were comparable to declines in mood seen during the start of internship but less than the declines seen in those who developed depression.</p><p>Not all political events were associated with statistically significant changes in mood score. No difference in mood was observed with the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the US Senate (mean mood change &#x02212;0.07, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.15 to 0.01, t=&#x02212;1.67, P=0.10), the deployment of troops to the Mexico border to meet a large migrant caravan (mean mood change &#x02212;0.03, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.09 to 0.03, t=&#x02212;1.04, P=0.30), or the 2018 midterm elections (mean mood change &#x02212;0.03, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.08 to 0.03, t=&#x02212;0.95, P=0.34). In contrast to the political events, none of the non-political events included in the analysis were statistically significantly associated with a change in mood. In a global analysis across all 17 events, we found that the absolute value of mood change after political events was statistically significantly greater than after non-political events (mean mood change difference 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.005, F=5.09, P=0.04). In our sensitivity analyses, we confirmed the same six political events were statistically significantly associated with a change in mean mood score after the event when including the baseline mood before the event as a covariate. In contrast, there were no statistically significant time effects for the three remaining political events or any of the non-political events (findings not shown but available from authors).</p><p>Some gender differences existed in our findings. Women experienced a greater decline in mood with the US presidential election compared with men (mean gender difference 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.58, t=2.33, P=0.02), and a greater decline in mood in response to the inauguration (mean gender difference 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.49, t=2.05, P=0.04). In contrast, men experienced a greater mood increase when the Senate failed to pass federal funding to build a border wall (mean gender difference 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.26, t=2.08, P=0.04).</p><p>Across the four geographic regions of the US, we noted no statistically significant difference in mood score change for 15 of 17 events. For the 2016 US presidential election (F=3.5, P=0.02) and January 2017 inauguration (F=3.2, P=0.03), the South region had smaller declines in mood compared to the Northeast, Midwest, and West.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings describe the susceptibility of young US physicians&#x02019; moods to major political events during arguably one of the hardest periods of their work lives: intern year. Although numerous factors related to their daily work schedule have been described extensively, the impact of exogenous factors such as those examined here has not been previously reported.</p><p>We found that the decline in mood with the 2016 US presidential election was greater than the decline with the start of internship&#x02014;a transition associated with a considerable increase in stress and a fivefold increase in depression.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This suggests that, even with the high demands and time constraints of internship, young US physicians were engaged with broader sociopolitical events. By comparison, we found that non-political events did not meaningfully affect mood in these young physicians in aggregate.</p><p>The directionality of these findings is consistent with evidence that young voters and voters with postgraduate education tend to identify as liberal leaning, and supports previous work showing a strong left shift in political affiliation among physicians over the past 25 years.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> With Republican campaign pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act and restrict women&#x02019;s access to reproductive health services domestically and abroad, these young physicians may have been especially concerned about the healthcare consequences of a Republican presidency.</p><p>We also found that women were particularly affected by the election results. Following the presidential election and subsequent inauguration, women experienced mood declines that were more than double that of their male counterparts. This finding suggests that the political discourse surrounding issues of gender and sexism throughout the presidential campaign may have disproportionately affected women. The gender difference may have also reflected a greater disappointment among women interns that the US did not elect its first female president. Female interns in our sample may have thus experienced the election outcome on both political and personal levels.</p><p>Political events continued to correlate with interns&#x02019; mood after the January 2017 presidential inauguration. Events with outcomes that aligned with conservative political ideologies, such as the Muslim travel ban and Brett Kavanaugh&#x02019;s confirmation to the US Supreme Court, were associated with a mood decrease. In contrast, events with outcomes in line with liberal political ideologies were followed by a mood increase, including the signing of a US presidential executive order to keep migrant families together at the US-Mexico border and following the Senate&#x02019;s failure to pass funding for a border wall. These findings further support existing evidence that young physicians may increasingly identify as liberal, particularly around factors such as gender, ethnicity, and nationality.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>For most political and non-political events, there was no statistically significant difference in mood change across the four primary US geographic regions. The exceptions to this trend were the presidential election and inauguration, with interns in the South experiencing smaller declines than interns in other regions. A higher proportion of the general population voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election in the South (51.8%) than in the Northeast (40.5%), Midwest (49.2%), or West (38.0%), suggesting that geographic differences in response to the highly partisan election and inauguration events among interns may reflect regional variation in political affiliation.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><sec><title>Implications</title><p>What possible mechanisms could underlie our overall findings? In a time defined by the 24 hour news cycle and instantaneous social media updates, exposure to political news is not only unavoidable, but constant. Acute media exposure to severe violence or disasters, such as the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, has been shown to negatively affect mental and physical health and even result in symptoms akin to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our findings suggest that, in recent years, repeated long term exposure to emotionally arousing news can also have psychological implications. While not as severe as PTSD, these emotional ups and downs may still add to the mental burden of young US physicians, who are already under high levels of stress and at increased risk for mental health issues.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>Previous research indicates that events like national elections can be experienced as stressful life events with psychological and biological consequences.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The 2016 US presidential election has been linked to increases in psychological distress, and short term mood changes following the election associated with more sustained physiological stress responses among young adults.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Studies have also shown an increase in psychological concerns and preterm births among Latina women following the 2016 election.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Along with our data, this suggests that large scale political events can influence factors relevant to mental and physical health, particularly for those with specific concerns about how the events may affect their lives. For physicians, however, this may extend beyond the personal implications. Shifts in mood among specific groups following sociopolitical events could also have professional consequences as physicians regularly interact with diverse populations.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> With our finding that political events are associated with changes in mood among young physicians in the US, future studies should examine whether similar dynamics are playing out for young physicians in other countries. In the UK, for example, there may also be emotional consequences for physicians increasingly concerned about the ramifications of Brexit for themselves and their patients.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>Leading medical organisations have emphasised the need for separation between medicine and politics throughout much of the 20th century.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Data from the present study suggests that maintaining this separation may be a challenge for the current generation of young physicians who appear to experience mood variations with major sociopolitical events. As residency is a period already characterised by high stress and risk for depression, emotional instability surrounding politics could have personal health implications. At the same time, as physicians&#x02019; treatment decisions can be influenced by feelings about politics, this could also lead to consequences for patient care.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations. Because our sample consisted of first year intern physicians, results may not be generalisable to all doctors or to other young, politically liberal populations. While we focused on the objectively most salient political and non-political events during the study period, other individual or societal level events affecting mood may have occurred during our study periods and confounded our results. Further, we assessed the effects of events on mood, rather than psychiatric diagnoses, such as major depressive disorder. In addition, because of limited power, we did not examine demographic differences beyond gender. Future investigation of the role of other characteristics, including race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, religion, and political affiliation would be beneficial. Finally, we focused on the US only. Similar dramatic societal events have occurred in other countries, and it is unclear how such exogenous factors affected their physician workforces.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this investigation of the contemporary effects of political events on the emotional state of young physicians using long term mood data from the Intern Health Study, we observed a statistically significant reduction in mood for the 2016 presidential election and most political events that followed. These findings suggest that in the current era, macro-level factors such as politics may affect the mood of young doctors, with some events leading to declines in mood that matched the drop in mood seen with the start of internship. These findings signal that politics and medicine may interact in strong ways in the current era of medicine and that we should carefully consider their implications for young physicians and their patients.</p><boxed-text id="boxa" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>What is already known about this topic</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="L18"><list-item><p>Heavy workloads, medical errors, and sleep deprivation are systematic factors that affect the mental health of training physicians</p></list-item><list-item><p>Physicians&#x02019; political beliefs can influence decisions about patient care</p></list-item><list-item><p>Debates about healthcare and other politicised social issues have become increasingly prominent and polarised in the contemporary era, yet the potential implications for physician mental health are unknown</p></list-item></list><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="bullet" id="L19"><list-item><p>In this longitudinal cohort study, contemporary political events were associated with a change in mood among young physicians</p></list-item><list-item><p>The greatest changes in mood were decreases observed in association with the 2016 presidential election and subsequent inauguration, with women experiencing more than twice the mood decline as men following both events</p></list-item><list-item><p>In contrast to political events, non-political events were not associated with a change in mood</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><boxed-text id="boxb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Patient and public involvement</title></caption><p>No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures for this study, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation.
