Although SR45 has orthologs in diverse eukaryotes, including human RNPS1, the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> null mutant is viable. Narrow flower petals and reduced seed formation suggest that SR45 regulates genes involved in diverse processes, including reproduction. To understand how SR45 is involved in the regulation of reproductive processes, we studied mRNA from the wild-type and <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> inflorescences using RNA-seq, and identified SR45-bound RNAs by immunoprecipitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Using a variety of bioinformatics tools, we identified a total of 358 SR45 differentially regulated (SDR) genes, 542 SR45-dependent alternative splicing (SAS) events, and 1812 SR45-associated RNAs (SARs). There is little overlap between SDR genes and SAS genes, and neither set of genes is enriched for flower or seed development. However, transcripts from reproductive process genes are significantly overrepresented in SARs. In exploring the fate of SARs, we found that a total of 81 SARs are subject to alternative splicing, while 14 of them are known Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) targets. Motifs related to GGNGG are enriched both in SARs and near different types of SAS events, suggesting that SR45 recognizes this motif directly. Genes involved in plant defense are significantly over-represented among genes whose expression is suppressed by SR45, and <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> plants do indeed show enhanced immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">We find that SR45 is a suppressor of innate immunity. We find that a single motif (GGNGG) is highly enriched in both RNAs bound by SR45 and in sequences near SR45- dependent alternative splicing events in inflorescence tissue. We find that the alternative splicing events regulated by SR45 are enriched for this motif whether the effect of SR45 is activation or repression of the particular event. Thus, our data suggests that SR45 acts to control splice site choice in a way that defies simple categorization as an activator or repressor of splicing.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-017-4183-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SR45</kwd><kwd>Differential gene expression</kwd><kwd>Regulation of alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>SR45-associated RNAs</kwd><kwd>Plant defense</kwd><kwd>Inflorescence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1146300</award-id><award-id>IOS-1456140</award-id><award-id>DBI-1564785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiao-Ning</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par11">In eukaryotic cells, pre-mRNA splicing is an important posttranscriptional processing step in the production of mature mRNAs. Regulated alternative splicing is a ubiquitous mechanism that contributes to protein diversity and function in affected biological processes. During splicing, different spliceosome components are recruited in a stepwise fashion to achieve recognition of splice sites, activation, and catalysis. At the end, the introns are excised, the spliced product is released, and the spliceosome disassembles to complete one splicing event. This process involves many regulatory proteins, including SR protein splicing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the Arabidopsis protein SR45 has been shown to complement human splicing extracts deficient in SR proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The human ortholog of SR45 is RNPS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which was originally discovered as a splicing activator in human HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and which interacts with spliceosome components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition to its role in splicing, RNPS1 also functions in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a quality control step that is regulated by the exon junction complex (EJC). EJC is a conserved protein complex composed of four highly conserved core proteins and a suite of dynamic peripheral proteins, including RNPS1. In particular, RNPS1 couples the EJC to the UP-FRAMESHIFT (UPF) protein complex to trigger NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These dual roles make RNPS1 a key bridge between splicing and the RNA quality control machinery, and it is likely that these functions of RNPS1 are conserved in SR45, its ortholog.</p><p id="Par12">Use of alternative 3&#x02032; splice sites in the sixth intron of the <italic>SR45</italic> pre-mRNA results in two different mature transcripts, <italic>SR45.1</italic> and <italic>SR45.2</italic>. This leads to a seven amino acid difference between the two respective protein isoforms, SR45.1 and SR45.2. These two isoforms play distinct roles during plant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A single phosphorylation event on threonine 218 (T<sup>218</sup>) within the distinguishing seven amino acids is crucial for the function of SR45.1 in flower petal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. SR45 has two serine/arginine-serine-rich (S/RS) domains, which may be used for protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To-date, several SR45.1-interacting proteins, including spliceosomal proteins and splicing factors such as SR proteins, have been identified using in vivo and/or in vitro approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is likely that SR45 interacts with these proteins through RS domains and functions to recruit snRNPs as in animals during the initiation and later steps of spliceosome assembly on target transcripts. In addition, SR45 co-localizes with EJC core proteins in the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], especially during hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All of this evidence reveals a complex protein-protein interaction network that involves SR45 and can potentially increase transcript complexity dramatically.</p><p id="Par13">A null <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant, <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic>, is viable as a homozygote, but exhibits various growth and developmental defects, including delayed root growth, narrower leaves and flower petals, late flowering, and unusual numbers of floral organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, the late flowering phenotype of the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant is not only due to a lack of expression of <italic>Flower Locus C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>), but is also associated with insufficient DNA methylation in the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This suggests that SR45 may regulate RdDM components for proper gene silencing during reproduction. In addition, the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant is hypersensitive to abiotic conditions, such as glucose and ABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], suggesting that SR45 regulates not only genes involved in growth and development, but also genes that mediate responses to environmental changes. However, effects of SR45 on biotic stresses have not been reported.</p><p id="Par14">The precise role of SR45 in the regulation of RNA processing remains unknown. Indeed, the pleiotropic phenotypes revealed by the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant indicate significant functional diversity among targets of regulation by SR45. In a recent study of early seedlings, Xing et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] found that SR45 can associate with and regulate transcripts from genes involved in ABA signaling. This observation provides a mechanistic explanation for the ABA hypersensitivity of the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">To investigate whether and how SR45 regulates flower development to promote reproductive success, we subjected inflorescence tissue from two independent SR45.1-GFP transgenic lines to RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (RIP-seq). We also performed RNA-seq analysis to compare the transcriptome of inflorescence tissue from wild type and <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> plants<italic>.</italic> Indeed, we find significant enrichment of reproduction-related genes among SARs. Other SARs have diverse molecular functions. This is consistent with a general role for SR45 in the processing of mRNA precursors. In addition, we find sequence motifs related to GGNGG to be enriched in both specific RIP-seq reads associated with SR45 and regions flanking sites of SR45-dependent alternative splicing. Furthermore, defense response genes were highly enriched in the SR45-suppressed genes, and this unexpected role of SR45 in defense response was further confirmed by plant defense assays, revealing an unexpected role for SR45 in suppressing plant innate immunity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SR45-regulated differential gene expression in inflorescence</title><p id="Par16">During flower development, petals protect plant reproductive organs and contribute to pollination success by attracting pollinators in the wild. The <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant exhibits a significantly narrower flower petal compared to the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This phenotype was mostly recovered by SR45.1-GFP, but not SR45.2-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. After fertilization, the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant had a reduction in seed yield (an average of 45 vs. 59 seeds per silique, 76% of Col-0), and the mutant silique was visibly shorter. This defect in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant was significantly improved by SR45.1-GFP, to 90% of Col-0, but not SR45.2-GFP (83% of Col-0) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These observations led to the hypothesis that SR45 promotes gene function in flower and seed development.

</p><p id="Par17">High quality Illumina Hiseq 50-nucleotide reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (Tair 10). We used three different pipelines (Tophat2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Splicing Transcripts Alignment Reference (STAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and Lasergene version 12 (LG12)) in order to eliminate pipeline-dependent bias during read alignment (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). A quality control step coupled with trimming region with biased base composition ensured that only high-quality reads were used for subsequent analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). Uniquely mapped reads were assigned to a genome locus based on the highest probability. Multimapping reads were assigned using criteria specific to each pipeline (see Methods). Reads with no match were not used for locus assignment. The three pipelines yielded similar numbers of total mapped reads (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1). The correlations among all resulting mappings were examined by pair-wise comparisons. The resulting R<sup>2</sup> values showed a high correlation among libraries from the same genetic background (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3). The assembly files were then filtered by same criteria, fold change &#x02265;2 and false discovery rate (<italic>FDR</italic>)&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.1, to yield SR45 differentially regulated (SDR) genes. A total of 739, 760 and 391 SR45-upregulated genes, and a total of 1052, 921 and 805 SR45-downregulated genes were identified by Tophat2, STAR and LG12, respectively (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2). After comparing the identity of these genes from all three pipelines, a total of 89 common genes were determined to be upregulated by SR45, and a total of 269 common genes were determined to be downregulated by SR45 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). While many positive gene candidates were no doubt excluded by applying such a highly stringent filter, combining the three different pipelines reduced the chance of false positives due to pipeline-specific bias during the assembly process, and provides us with a robust set of common genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated by SR45 with high confidence. Therefore, we followed up with these common genes in the subsequent analysis.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Defense genes are highly enriched in SR45-downregulated genes. <bold>a</bold>.

When we compared the GO enrichment pattern in all analyses (Tophat2, STAR, LG12) individually (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S3), we found that all of the GO terms enriched in the common gene set showed similar or much better enrichment than was seen in the three individual pipelines. This suggests that the common gene set does indeed contain reduced background noise. However, the <italic>p-</italic>values for each GO category in the common gene set were slightly higher in most categories than in the individual pipelines due to a smaller number of the remaining genes in the common gene set.</p><p id="Par19">The 89 SR45-upregulated genes are involved in diverse biological processes, from metabolism (<italic>Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase 4, isocitrate lyase,</italic> and <italic>GDSL esterase</italic>), transport (<italic>peptide transporter 4, sodium/metabolite cotransporter BASS5</italic> and <italic>BASS6</italic>), auxin biosynthesis (<italic>YUC4</italic>), kinases (<italic>MAPKKK21</italic> and <italic>GWD2</italic>) to transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation (<italic>RDR3</italic>, <italic>SR45, CID9</italic>) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2).

Known defense marker genes (<italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>PR5</italic>), salicylic acid (SA) pathway genes (<italic>ACD6</italic> and <italic>PAD4</italic>), and LRR-receptor like protein genes (<italic>RLP34</italic> and <italic>RLP41</italic>) were all confirmed to have statistically significantly higher expression in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant than the Col-0 wild type (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6k</xref>)<italic>.</italic> This suggests that SR45 plays a role in repressing the defense network when plants are not facing pathogen challenges. In addition, genes involved in protein phosphorylation, especially kinases, are also significantly overrepresented in the SR45-downregulated genes with a fold of enrichment of 5.06 and a <italic>p-</italic>value of 1.24E-13. These kinase genes include those coding for 11 proteins with leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and 20 cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinases (CRKs) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2). To-date, a total of 44 CRKs have been identified in Arabidopsis and some are induced by ROS signaling, pathogen and SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Twenty of them (about half) are induced in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant, suggesting that SR45 may suppress a mechanism(s) that can trigger the simultaneous expression of many CRK genes during flower and/or seed development. In all 68 defense genes annotated by PANTHER, at least one W-box was found statistically significantly more highly presented in the &#x02212;500&#x000a0;bps upstream genomic region compared to the genome background (TTTGAC with a <italic>p-</italic>value of 1.47E-80, TTGACC with a <italic>p-</italic>value of 0.00E&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;00, and/or TTGACT with a <italic>p-</italic>value of 0.00E&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;00) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2). This strongly suggests that the expression of this subset of defense genes may be controlled by a small set of WRKY transcription factors, and these WRKY transcription factors bind to sequences in the target genes better in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant. The large number of plant defense genes present in the SR45-downregulated gene group led us to the hypothesis that SR45 negatively regulate innate immunity in Arabidopsis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>SR45-dependent alternative splicing events in inflorescence</title><p id="Par21">SR45 regulates pre-mRNA splicing of target transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

</p><p id="Par22">These 759 SAS events are located in 542 genes within which only 7 (SAS_UP) are upregulated by SR45 and 8 (SAS_DN) are downregulated by SR45 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Among the 8 SAS_DN genes, two genes (<italic>WRKY18</italic>, and <italic>GRP3</italic>) are responsive to pathogen or SA. Most SAS events do not result in overall changes in gene expression at the level of total RNA abundance. Among these 542 SAS genes, transcripts encoding mRNA-binding proteins are significantly enriched (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). The function of these genes includes splicing regulation (<italic>RS41, RSZ22</italic> and <italic>SCL30A</italic>), regulation of polyadenylation (<italic>PAB8</italic> and RBP47C), stress granule formation (<italic>UBP1B</italic>), RNA degradation (<italic>DCP2</italic>), translation (<italic>RPS1, RPL13AB, RPL13B</italic> and <italic>RPL15B</italic>), and defense response (<italic>UBA2C</italic>). This indicates that SR45 can regulate diverse aspects of mRNA metabolism through its effects on alternative splicing. It is not known whether SR45 acts directly or indirectly on the splicing of these genes. Although DCP2 has been indicated in post-embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], GO enrichment analysis does not support a prominent connection to flower and seed development. Possibilities still remain that SR45 regulates the viability and/or splicing of associated transcripts, then the product of these associated transcripts regulate their targets post transcriptionally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>SR45 associates with a subset of reproduction-regulating transcripts in inflorescence</title><p id="Par23">In order to identify SR45-associated transcripts in inflorescence, RIP-seq analysis was conducted with a GFP control line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and two SR45.1-GFP transgenic lines that we established previously (OX1&#x02013;1 and OX1&#x02013;9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

A total of 1812 genes were shared by both pipelines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The transcripts from these genes were considered SR45-associated RNAs (SARs) in inflorescence. Selected SARs were confirmed by RIP-qPCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Interestingly, more than one third (677 out of 1812, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) of these inflorescence SAR genes overlap with the SAR genes from seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

</p><p id="Par24">The next logical question is what the fates of these inflorescence SAR genes are. One possibility is alternative splicing, or they could be degraded via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). We intersected the 1812 inflorescence SAR genes with 542 SAS genes and 49 known NMD targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). A total of 14 inflorescence SAR genes are recognized as NMD targets, while a total of 81 inflorescence SAR genes have identified SR45-dependent alternative splicing events (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5). This is a significant over-representation of NMD targets (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001 by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), and we have confirmed that five of these genes show increased abundance in <italic>upf3&#x02013;1</italic> plants which has impaired NMD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), We expect the number of inflorescence SAR genes that are known to be NMD targets will increase as more research data becomes available. Nevertheless, this still leaves the majority of the inflorescence SARs unaffected by either alternative splicing or NMD. Indeed, of the 1812 inflorescence SAR genes, 66 (3.6%) of them have no introns according to the AtRTD2 annotation. This phenomenon has been observed in 7.8% of seedling SAR genes using TAIR10 annotation recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although the two annotations differ with respect to intronless genes, 90% of genes annotated by TAIR10 as intronless are likewise described as intronless by AtRTD2, and the majority of intronless SARs found in this study are annotated as intronless in both TAIR10 and AtRTD2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). The discrepancy between the two experiments could reflect a real difference between inflorescence and seedling, some unconfirmed annotations in TAIR10, and/or the incompleteness of AtRTD2. However, both studies clearly indicate that SR45 binds to many transcripts that are neither spliced nor subjected to NMD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Over-representation of motifs related to GGNGG at sites of SR45 binding and regulation</title><p id="Par25">In order to identify potential binding sites for SR45, we looked for motifs that are over-represented in SARs or near sites of SR45-dependent alternative splicing.</p><p id="Par26">First, we submitted the plus (mRNA-like) strand of all reads from the 1812 SAR genes identified by both of our analysis pipelines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) to XXmotif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The most significant motifs from these 40 XXmotif analyses were examined manually and a set of similar motifs was selected for further analysis (see Methods). Then, the enrichment of specific occurrences of these similar motifs (the regular expressions GGNNNNGGNGG, GGNGGNGG, GGNGG, CNNCNNCNNCNNC, CNCCNNCNCC and CGNCGNCG) were examined for all AS events, and their enrichment vs. all alternative splicing events of the same type was calculated (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S6). The greatest, and most significant, enrichments observed were for GGNGG and related motifs.

Independent methods (immunoprecipitation of SR45-bound RNAs and analysis of differential alternative splicing) have also identified the same motif (GGNGG) as a likely site of SR45 binding. Furthermore, we find that the patterns of alternative splicing observed are inconsistent with simple models in which SR45 either activates or represses splicing.</p><p id="Par30">The splicing factor SR45 has diverse roles, including developmental regulation and abiotic stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Until recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], evidence in describing mechanisms of SR45 functions has been rather limited. Various in vitro and in vivo studies have painted a rather focused protein network that SR45 is associated with, mainly including spliceosome components and SR proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although SR45 is orthologous to RNPS1 by sequence and domain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], experimental confirmation of conserved function has been lacking. Because RNPS1 is a peripheral protein of the EJC, direct binding or indirect association of SR45 with the Arabidopsis EJC may be transient and difficult to catch in vivo<italic>.</italic> RNPS1 is also a component of two alternative complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], ASAP (Acinus, RNPS1 and SAP18) and PSAP (Pinin, RNPS1 and SAP18). Although both complexes are involved in splicing regulation, the outcomes (whether a splicing event is promoted or inhibited) can be quite different dependent on what other protein factors they interact with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. With the revealed protein network in mind, it is of importance to investigate the identity, fate and function of immediate transcript targets of SR45 and SR45-associated protein networks in order to understand how SR45 regulates splicing in supporting the success of a biological system.</p><p id="Par31">Here, we have studied the gene network that SR45 regulates by examining reproductive tissue for changes in alternative splicing and mRNA levels, and by asking which RNAs SR45 protein associates with in this tissue. We find that SR45 is associated with transcripts involved in reproductive process and RNA splicing, an observation that is consistent with the straightforward hypothesis that SR45, a splicing factor, may influence plant reproduction by acting on transcripts involved in reproduction. Previous studies have shown that the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant plant flowers late, produces an abnormally high level of <italic>FLOWER LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>), a MADS-box repressor of vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and fails to sustain a normal level of DNA methylation in a DRM2-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant produces fewer seeds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). <italic>FLC</italic> is regulated by Polycomb group (PcG)-mediated histone modification via an epigenetic reader recognizing cold memory element within the <italic>FLC</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our study confirmed its increased expression in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Transcripts of a suite of histone modifiers were identified in SARs in our study (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5), among which <italic>VIP4</italic> has been shown to directly regulate the expression of <italic>FLC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>FLC</italic> is also regulated by DNA methylation mediated by two RNA-binding proteins, FPA and FCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. With a nonsense mutation in the first RRM3-coding sequence, the <italic>fca-8</italic> mutant failed to properly methylate <italic>FLC,</italic> flowered late and exhibit mild flower defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. <italic>FPA</italic> is also a confirmed NMD target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We confirmed that SR45 is associated with the <italic>FPA</italic> transcript (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). It is possible that SR45 directly regulates <italic>FPA</italic> at posttranscriptional level to ensure there is enough FPA protein around to mediate regulated-methylation at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus and other loci contributing to reproduction. Another interesting SAR is <italic>HUA ENHANCED 4</italic> (<italic>HEN4</italic>), a transcript codes for a KH domain RNA-binding protein that promote proper processing of <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Defects in <italic>HEN4</italic> genes caused stamen transforming into petal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant has mild alteration in the number of stamen and petals, and narrower petal morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is possible that SR45 regulates flower development via genes such as <italic>HEN4.</italic> However, <italic>HEN4</italic> is neither identified as an SDR gene nor an SAS gene in this study. If <italic>HEN4</italic> indeed plays a key role in SR45-regulated flower development, it would be done through an unknown mechanism yet to be addressed. However, among the 7 SR45-upregulated SAS (SAS_UP) genes, <italic>AT1G20120, AT1G23570</italic> and <italic>AT1G23580</italic> exhibit flower-specific expression pattern (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Figure S5). When SR45 is associated with reproductive SARs, the protein product of some SARs could somehow affect splicing of these flower-specific SAS_UP genes and cause an upregulation in their expression during flower development. Although the role of SR45 on reproduction is not well understood, our study provided evidence for possible mechanisms that SR45 employs to regulate reproduction.</p><p id="Par32">By associating with multiple transcripts from genes encoding proteins involved in splicing, including those which encode SR45-associated proteins (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5) SR45 has the potential to regulate a vast splicing network. Although it is not clear if these RNA splicing regulator proteins directly bind to their own transcripts, this seemingly self-regulatory pathway has been observed in the case of <italic>FCA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]<italic>.</italic> In addition, transcripts of most SR proteins are alternatively spliced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and SR proteins can interact with other proteins via their RS domains in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It seems to be an efficient strategy for SR45 to target SR protein transcripts that can in turn modulate further targets to increase the transcriptome complexity rapidly. Besides, some SARs are targets of NMD or differentially regulated by SR45 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5). All the evidence described above suggests a diverse fate map for SARs. This makes the analysis of SARs more complicated. Besides, association with SR45 can lead to different outcomes in a case-dependent manner. It is even more puzzling to see that 66 SARs are intronless according to AtRTD2. Since SR45 acts in a protein network, it is possible that SR45 is associated with these transcripts via other protein partner(s), some of which may play a role in transcription-splicing coupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The versatility of SR45-associated protein functions is likely a key to the intronless SARs. None of these 66 intronless SARs have identified SAS events, and none are upregulated by SR45. Only two of the intronless SARs (<italic>AT3G25010</italic> and <italic>AT3G25020</italic>) are down-regulated by SR45, both of which are involved in defense response. In fact, most SARs neither have SAS events, show SR45-dependent differential expression, nor are NMD targets. The reason for their association with SR45 remains to be investigated.</p><p id="Par33">In search for potential SR45-binding sites in SARs, we found that motifs related to GGNGG (including GGNNNNGGNGG, GGNGGNGG and GGNGGNGG) are significantly over-represented near sites of alternative splicing affected by the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These motifs were especially over-represented in both introns and exons adjacent to alternative splice sites (particularly, A5, A3 and RI). Enrichment was highest (and <italic>p</italic> values lowest) in alternative splicing events with a positive <italic>&#x00394;&#x003c8;</italic>, meaning that these sequences were included at a higher rate in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant, but events with negative <italic>&#x00394;&#x003c8;</italic> also show a significant enrichment. The classical model for SR protein activation of splicing through Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESEs) suggests that the SR protein binding sites would be enriched in exons whose inclusion depends on those SR proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Indeed, GGNGG is enriched 1.4 fold (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.63) in SE exons whose inclusion is reduced in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant, and depleted four-fold (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.18) in SE exons whose inclusion is increased in the mutant (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S6). However, neither of these enrichments is statistically significant. In contrast, the most significant enrichment (over 6-fold) occurs in the region between the two alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites that show a positive <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic> (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; <italic>p</italic>-value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.4E-48). This is the opposite of what would be expected if SR45 were an activator of ESEs. Furthermore, GGNGG motifs are consistently enriched in splicing events affected by SR45 knockout, in both introns and exons, and independent of whether the effect on <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic> is positive or negative. Thus, we propose that SR45 acts to define the regions for splicing and facilitate the effect of other regulators, whose effect on alternative splicing is responsible for the outcome. This hypothesis is consistent with both the relatively mild (viable) phenotypes of <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant and the fact that it is a (peripheral) member of the exon junction complex, which associates with all spliced transcripts.</p><p id="Par34">This finding is similar, but not identical, to one of the hypothesized <italic>cis-</italic>elements in SAR found in seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] which resembles a comparable splicing enhancer sequence bound by a splicing activator, TRA2 in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It is also worth noting that our GGNGG motif is found both around promoted splicing events and around suppressed splicing events. It suggests that SR45 may cause activation or suppression of a near-by splicing event. This difference between our finding and prior findings will need to be further tested with in vitro binding assays with functional SR45 proteins. Since SR45 has one low complexity domain resides on each end of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], producing a large quantity of pure functional SR45 protein in heterogeneous hosts remains a challenge.</p><p id="Par35">Several SARs that exhibit SAS events (for example, <italic>AT4G16990, AT3G46530</italic> and <italic>AT1G588070</italic>) code for NBS-LRR proteins. NBS-LRR proteins are R proteins that can regulate defense signaling pathways once pathogen effectors are detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although their gene targets are still unknown, it has been suggested that these NBS-LRRs may associate with WRKY transcription factors to induce the expression of defense genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. All the highly enriched defense genes downregulated by SR45 have W-box sequences in their promoter region up to &#x02212;500&#x000a0;bps (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2). Our data does not provide evidence for which WRKY proteins may be responsible for the expression of these defense genes in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant. Although 6 <italic>WRKYs</italic> are identified as SARs in inflorescence, they do not seem to be differentially alternatively spliced or differentially expressed in our experiment. If they were the players that associate with the NBS-LRRs to trigger defense gene expression, SR45 may be regulating these <italic>WRKY</italic> SARs in ways other than alternative splicing and differential expression to suppress their functions in plant defense. One possibility would be that associating with SR45 makes them unavailable to the translation machinery, and they become available in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> null mutant. But this will need to be tested at protein level in the future. In additional, three non-SAR <italic>WRKYs, WRKY18, WRKY75</italic> and <italic>WRKY50</italic>, have been shown to play roles in plant defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. They all exhibit a higher level of expression in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S3). Although it is not clear how they were promoted in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant and whether they can regulate their own expression, they may be important players in binding to W-box and inducing the expression of other defense genes seen in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant. One question needs to be addressed is that the overrepresentation of defense genes in the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant was from inflorescence. Although it is not fully understood what roles defense response genes play in inflorescence, evidence has suggested that stress-responsive genes are induced in sepals, and biotic stimuli-responsive genes are enriched in mature flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. If SR45 is a true repressor for plant defense, then the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> null mutant should exhibit a higher resistance to pathogens and/or a more dramatic response to pathogen-derived elicitors. Indeed, the <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant showed elevated basal defense to flg22 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d-i</xref>) and a stronger resistance to virulent pathogens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a-c</xref>). The current understanding on plant innate immunity is mostly focused on SA biosynthesis, accumulation and SA-mediated signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The <italic>sr45&#x02013;1</italic> mutant accumulates significantly higher level of free SA and total SA compared to Col-0 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6j</xref>). This big difference suggests that SR45 may post a greater suppression on the SA biosynthesis and/or less of catabolism than Col-0. Future studies on how SR45 affect SA metabolism will shed light on this significant difference that we observed. A second question is whether SR45 suppresses plant defense via SA-dependent or SA-independent pathways. An evaluation of pathogen response in the context of SA-deficient mutants will help explore the mechanism(s) that SR45 uses to suppress plant innate immunity.</p><p id="Par36">When using comparative bioinformatics approaches to look for SDR genes, we noticed that each pipeline (Tophat2, STAR and LG12) produced a different set of candidate genes, among which the common genes are less than 50%. This observation underscores an issue that each computer algorithm is set up differently. During computing, the number of mapped reads is similar from pipeline to pipeline, but slight differences in read assignment algorithm can create large discrepancies as we reported in our experiment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). A more in-depth comparison and fine-tuning in different pipelines will increase the power of bioinformatics in revealing highly confident and meaningful information in biology. At present time, the risk of misplacement of multimapping reads is more prominent in short reads than long reads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">In conclusion, our study provides valuable information suggesting possible ways that SR45 and its associated protein network may affect reproduction and defense against pathogens. Motifs related to GGNGG are enriched both in SARs and near different types of SAS events, suggesting that SR45 recognizes this motif directly to regulate splicing in a way that defies simple categorization as an activator or repressor of splicing. Future work on confirming each mechanistic connection proposed here will increase understanding of how SR45 works with other proteins to fine tune the alternative splicing network and regulate crucial processes such as reproduction and plant defense.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant growth condition</title><p id="Par38">All <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants used in this study are in <italic>Colombia</italic> (Col-0) background.
