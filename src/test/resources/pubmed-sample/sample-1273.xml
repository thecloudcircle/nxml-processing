Tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF1120 (Nintedanib) has been evaluated in clinical trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma, but has not been explored for liver fibrosis yet. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of BIBF1120 in liver fibrogenesis. The effects of BIBF1120 were evaluated in TGF&#x003b2;-activated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, LX2 cells, primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrogenesis mouse model. Fibroblasts-conditioned medium studies were performed to assess the paracrine effects on macrophages and endothelial cells. <italic>In-vitro</italic> in TGF&#x003b2;-activated fibroblasts, BIBF1120 significantly inhibited expression of major fibrotic parameters, wound-healing and contractility. <italic>In vivo</italic> in CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced acute liver injury model, post-disease BIBF1120 administration significantly attenuated collagen accumulation and HSC activation. Interestingly, BIBF1120 drastically inhibited intrahepatic inflammation and angiogenesis. To further elucidate the mechanism of action, 3T3-conditioned medium studies demonstrated increased 3T3-mediated macrophage chemotaxis and endothelial cells tube formation and activation, which was significantly decreased by BIBF1120. These results suggests that BIBF1120 can be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of liver fibrosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Liver fibrosis is characterized by the extensive accumulation of abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins leading to liver dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Hepatocellular damage, inflammatory cells infiltration and extensive tissue remodelling, vascular disorganisation and tissue hypoxia ultimately culminate into progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis or end-stage liver failure, leading to high morbidity and mortality worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Despite our increasing understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, no anti-fibrotics are currently licensed for use in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs or liver myofibroblasts) are the main effector cells involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In normal liver, quiescent HSCs store vitamin A in lipid droplets, but in response to liver injury, damaged hepatocytes and inflammatory cells released growth factors and pro-fibrogenic cytokines, HSCs undergo characteristic morphological and functional changes to transform to proliferative, contractile and ECM-producing myofibroblasts characterized by the loss of vitamin droplets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Macrophages, found in close proximity to HSCs also play a key role in fibrosis initiation and progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Hepatic macrophages can arise either from circulating bone-marrow derived monocytes, which are recruited to the injured liver, or from proliferating resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Resident macrophages have shown to play a role in initiating inflammatory responses during tissue injury, while infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages leads to chronic liver inflammation and fibrogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Both resident and recruited macrophages produce pro-fibrotic mediators and chemokines that directly activate and recruit fibroblasts and inflammatory cells and control ECM turnover by regulating the balance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. During recruitment due to liver damage, inflammatory monocytes undergo differentiation into two distinct subsets of macrophages that are categorized as classically-activated inflammatory M1-like macrophages activated by Th1 cytokines e.g. IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-12, or alternatively-activated resolving M2-like macrophages stimulated by Th2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-13<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. There exists a positive interplay between HSCs and inflammatory macrophages strongly contributing to amplification of fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. We have also recently shown a Notch-mediated cross-talk between fibroblasts and macrophages in liver fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Additionally, recent data have revealed that angiogenesis contributes significantly to the progression of fibrosis during the wound healing process in chronic liver damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. A critical link between angiogenesis, inflammation and fibrosis has been investigated during chronic liver diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. HSCs activated in response to hypoxia, play a key role in angiogenesis through interactions with endothelial cells via PGDF and VEGF signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. These data suggests the multidimensional role of HSCs i.e. exaggerating inflammation and angiogenesis in liver fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) has shown to play a critical role in liver fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. LSECs are required to maintain HSCs quiescence, but during liver fibrosis, LSECs become highly pro-inflammatory and are a critical component of intrahepatic inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Thus, there is an intricate interplay between the non-parenchymal cells that either prevents or sustains HSC activation and thereby determines fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>HSCs are also important source of growth factors e.g. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Transforming growth factor (TGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) that stimulate HSCs in autocrine manner and also activate other key cell types via paracrine signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. PDGF signaling pathway is a well-known pathway for HSC activation. PDGF is the most potent mitogen for HSCs and induction of its receptor, PDGF&#x003b2;R, is a hallmark of early HSCs activation, followed by HSCs transformation to contractile phenotype, and correlates with the degree of fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. PDGF antagonism and pharmacological inhibition of PDGF&#x003b2;R has shown to be a promising therapeutic approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Receptors for vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are also shown to be induced during HSC activation that contribute to angiogenesis and fibroblasts activation respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. BIBF1120 (or Nintedanib) is a triple tyrosine kinase or tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks key HSCs receptors e.g. FGFR, PDGFR and VEGFR. BIBF1120 has been tested previously and showed potential therapeutic effects in a preclinical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) models and in clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.

We further examined the effect of BIBF1120 on TGF&#x003b2;-induced collagen deposition and activation of fibroblasts. We observed that following TGF&#x003b2; activation, there was a significant increase in protein and gene expression of major fibrotic parameter (collagen-I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). Treatment with BIBF1120 induced significant dose-dependent reduction in collagen-I protein expression in TGF&#x003b2;-activated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and also a substantial inhibition in the respective mRNA expression levels was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Furthermore, BIBF1120 led to the inhibition of TGF&#x003b2;-stimulated fibroblasts activation as depicted by attenuation of mRNA expression levels of &#x003b1;-SMA (alpha smooth muscle actin); PDGF&#x003b2;R (Platelet derived growth factor beta receptor) and TIMP1 (Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D&#x02013;F</xref>). Periostin is a TGF&#x003b2; superfamily-responsive matricellular protein, produced by fibroblasts, has been shown to be important for collagen fibrillogenesis and overall organization of ECM. We also analyzed the effects of BIBF1120 on Periostin expression and observed substantial upregulation of Periostin in response to TGF&#x003b2; which was drastically reduced to normal levels following incubation with BIBF1120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1G</xref>). We also assessed the effects on the fibronectin receptor, Integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) since it has been shown that &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 is highly expressed in fibroblasts and promotes fibroblast motility and survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.

We demonstrate that tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF1120 strongly attenuated TGF&#x003b2;-activated fibroblasts and HSC activation, collagen deposition, HSC contractility and migration <italic>in vitro. In vivo</italic> in CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced early liver fibrogenesis in mice, BIBF1120 significantly inhibited collagen deposition and HSC differentiation. Remarkably, BIBF1120 suppressed intrahepatic inflammation and angiogenesis. To understand the role of BIBF1120 in inflammation and angiogenesis, we performed conditioned medium <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and showed that BIBF1120 inhibited fibroblasts induced paracrine effects on macrophages (inflammation) and endothelial cells (angiogenesis). This preliminary pre-clinical investigative study exploring BIBF1120 in liver fibrosis suggests the potent inhibitory effects of BIBF1120 and suggests that BIBF1120 should be explored in the clinical trials for the treatment of liver fibrosis.</p><p>Liver fibrogenesis is a chronic progressive disease, characterized by scar formation due to the increased production and deposition of ECM proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The key fibrogenic effector cell type is the activated hepatic stellate cells also known as myofibroblasts. HSCs have matrix producing functions and contractile properties resulting in liver distortion and dysfunction. HSCs also make a major contribution to the important aspects of the wound healing process including regeneration, inflammation and angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Upon activation due to liver damage, activated HSCs secrete growth factors e.g. PDGF, FGF, TGF, EGF, VEGF and chemokines i.e. MCP1, IL-6 etc. These mediators stimulates HSCs in autocrine fashion and also stimulates other cell types i.e. hepatocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells in paracrine manner important for liver regeneration, intrahepatic inflammation and angiogenesis respectively. HSCs are also shown to induce the expression of several receptors importantly PDGFR&#x003b1; and PDGFR&#x003b2;, VEGFR and FGFR and are important for the autocrine activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Simultaneous blocking of these receptors will therefore induce significant de-differentiation of HSCs and therefore would influence downstream processes like intrahepatic inflammation and angiogenesis.</p><p>BIBF1120 (or Nintedanib) is a potent tyrosine inhibitor that blocks PDGFR, VEGFR and FGFR. It has been shown in lung fibroblasts that apart from these receptors, BIBF1120 has inhibitory effects on Lck, Lyn as analyzed using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. BIBF1120 has been extensively examined in lung fibrosis mouse models, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and demonstrated inhibitory effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and therefore currently actively investigated in ongoing clinical trials for IPF patients. But this potent multikinase inhibitor has not been explored in liver fibrosis. In lung fibroblasts, it has been shown that BIBF1120 exert inhibitory effects by inhibiting PDGFR phosphorylation, fibroblasts proliferation and activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In this study, we showed that BIBF1120 at increasing doses inhibit PDGF-induced fibroblasts proliferation. BIBF1120 exerted significant reduction in Collagen I expression and deposition, fibroblasts activation and matrix remodeling proteins i.e. TIMP1 (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1) inducing collagen degradation by MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases), Integrins (ITGA5) and periostin (ligand for integrins) that support cell adhesion and migration via signaling through FAK-mediated signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We further examined the specific effects of BIBF1120 in human HSCs, and found that BIBF1120 attenuated TGF&#x003b2;-stimulated HSCs activation, collagen I expression, HSCs migration and contractility.</p><p>BIBF1120 has shown to exhibit anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in lung fibrosis mouse models. In this study, we first demonstrate upregulation of PDGFR, VEGFR and FGFR in acute liver fibrogenesis mouse model. Thereafter, we analyzed BIBF1120 in acute liver fibrogenesis mouse model. Interestingly, we observed anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects of BIBF1120. We found that BIBF1120 significantly inhibited adhesion proteins (Periostin, fibronectin, ITGA5 and cadherin-11) that are important in cell adhesion, motility and contractility which are important factors for portal hypertension since increased portal hypertension further deteriorates the liver function. Furthermore, we observed strong inhibition of angiogenesis partially exhibited due to the drastic inhibition of Notch signaling pathway and SOX9 expression that has shown to regulate many developmental processes including angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. To delineate the anti-inflammatory effects, we analyzed specific M1 and M2 macrophages markers and we found that inflammatory M1 macrophages remained unchanged while there was significant upregulation in suppressive M2 macrophages suggesting BIBF1120 via indirect pathways stimulate M2-directed macrophage polarization. Since inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1; and CCL2 play an important role in development of fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, the inhibition of these pro-fibrogenic factors resulted in reduced fibrosis.</p><p>To further understand the effects of BIBF1120 on angiogenesis and intrahepatic inflammation, we performed paracrine cross-talk studies with fibroblasts (and HSCs), macrophages (and kupffer cells) and endothelial cells (and LSECs). We observed that fibroblasts conditioned medium contains factors that stimulate macrophage activation, and endothelial cells activation in paracrine fashion. Interestingly, BIBF1120 incubated fibroblasts inhibited release of these paracrine factors and therefore exhibited attenuated macrophage activation, and endothelial cells activation.</p><p>However, there are number of limitations within this study. This study has been performed in acute (or mild) liver fibrogenesis model that does not correspond to the clinical situation. Patients normally presents to the clinic when liver damage progresses to cirrhosis associated with portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. Nevertheless, this study provided first proof-of-concept results suggesting BIBF1120 can be an effective therapeutic drug to be explored further in liver fibrosis. Multi-kinase inhibitors however have shown to be highly toxic since they inhibit number of crucial pathways that are involved in number of cellular processes and long-term treatment or multi-dose treatment might be needed to overcome poor pharmacokinetics of these small molecule inhibitors might lead to toxicity. Therefore, HSC-selective delivery of these inhibitors using nanocarriers should be investigated as future promising therapies for the treatment of liver fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated the anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects of BIBF1120 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in acute liver fibrogenesis mouse model. These findings unveil the novel pathways regulated by BIBF1120 in fibrosis and further studies are warranted to investigate therapeutic efficacy of BIBF1120 in advanced models of liver fibrosis and finally poses an interesting drug to be explored in the clinical trials for the treatment of liver fibrosis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell Lines</title><p>Human hepatic stellate cells (LX2 cells), immortalized human derived cell line were kindly provided by Prof. Scott Friedman (Mount Sinai Hospital, New York).
