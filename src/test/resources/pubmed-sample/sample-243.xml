NP genome-mining aims at extracting biosynthetic information from the genomes of microbes presumed to produce these compounds. Typically, canonical enzyme sequences from known biosynthetic systems are identified after sequence similarity searches. Despite this being an efficient process, the likelihood of identifying truly novel systems by this approach is low. To overcome this limitation, we previously introduced EvoMining, a genome-mining approach that incorporates evolutionary principles. Here, we release and use our latest EvoMining version, which includes novel visualization features and customizable databases, to analyse 42 central metabolic enzyme families (EFs) conserved throughout <named-content content-type="phylum">

We found that expansion-and-recruitment profiles of these 42 families are lineage specific, opening the metabolic space related to &#x02018;shell&#x02019; enzymes. These enzymes, which have been overlooked, are EFs with orthologues present in most of the genomes of a taxonomic group, but not in all. As a case study of canonical shell enzymes, we characterized the expansion and recruitment of glutamate dehydrogenase and acetolactate synthase into scytonemin biosynthesis, and into other central metabolic pathways driving Archaea and Bacteria adaptive evolution. By defining the origin and fate of enzymes, EvoMining complements traditional genome-mining approaches as an unbiased strategy and opens the door to gaining insights into the evolution of NP biosynthesis. We anticipate that EvoMining will be broadly used for evolutionary studies, and for generating predictions of unprecedented chemical scaffolds and new antibiotics.

</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Impact Statement</title></caption><p>EvoMining allows the study of expansion-and-recruitment events in enzyme families (EFs) in Archaea and Bacteria lineages, with the goal of providing both evolutionary insights and a genome-mining approach for the discovery of truly novel natural product (NP) biosynthetic gene clusters. Thus, by better understanding the origin and fate of gene copies within EFs, this work contributes towards the identification of lineage-dependent enzymes that we call &#x02018;shell&#x02019; enzymes, which are ideal beacons to unveil &#x02018;chemical dark matter&#x02019;. We show that enzyme functionality is a continuum, including transition enzymes located between central and specialized metabolism. To exemplify these evolutionary dynamics, we focus on the genes directing the synthesis of the sunscreen peptide scytonemin, as the two key enzymes of this biosynthetic pathway can be considered as canonical examples of shell enzymes. We also show how evolutionary approaches are suitable for studying unexplored lineages, such as those belonging to the domain Archaea, which is systematically mined here for novel NPs. The release of EvoMining as a stand-alone tool will allow researchers to explore their own EFs of interest, within their own genomic lineages of expertise, by considering the lessons learned from this work.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1-4"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural products (NPs), or specialized metabolites, are naturally occurring molecules widely used in medicine and in other applications [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. NPs are typically encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) found in the genomes of a wide range of organisms. From sources as diverse as bacteria, fungi and plants, there are around 1800&#x02009;NPs with their cognate BGCs experimentally characterized. This body of knowledge, contained in a community-driven hierarchical repository called the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], allows the investigation of newly sequenced Archaea and Bacteria genomes as never before. Indeed, current availability of around half a million bacterial genomes in public databases (DBs) has not only invigorated research into NPs, but it has also prompted the development of novel genome-mining bioinformatic tools [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>]. The latter have evolved from simple sequence similarity searches of known biosynthetic enzymes, with an emphasis on the domains of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>], to genome-mining platforms that look into complete BGCs, such as the antibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell (antiSMASH) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For instance, from only 6200 closed bacterial genomes, a total number of 32&#x0200a;584 BGCs have been identified using antiSMASH [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Known classes of NP BGCs are successfully predicted by antiSMASH; nevertheless, not all BGCs correspond with well-known biosynthetic enzyme classes. Within MIBiG there are 231 BGCs (12.7&#x0200a;%) classified as &#x02018;other&#x02019;, which indeed lack a PKS, NRPS or any of the other enzyme classes characteristic of specialized metabolism. Absence of known biosynthetic enzymes makes these BGCs &#x02018;atypical&#x02019;, hard to identify, relating them to the term &#x02018;chemical dark matter&#x02019; [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An example of this scenario is provided by the BGC of the cyanobacterial sunscreen scytonemin [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which includes ScyB and ScyA as the two key biosynthetic enzymes sustaining the synthesis of this specialized metabolite [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>]. Interestingly, ScyB and ScyA are distant homologues of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and acetolactate synthase (ALS), respectively, which take part in the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate and ammonia [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and in the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], respectively.</p><p>Therefore, despite the overwhelming amount of accurately predicted BGCs, there is still plenty of space to discover and prioritize novel biosynthetic systems. For example, in our previous work, it was estimated that EvoMining expanded antiSMASH predictions between 15 and 26&#x0200a;% in <named-content content-type="phylum">

</named-content> genomes [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To address the problem of the limited novelty revealed by genome-mining approaches based on sequence similarity searches, we have previously introduced the use of evolutionary principles driving the emergence of NP BGCs [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>]. The latter gave place to EvoMining, which recapitulates enzyme evolutionary events as follows: any given enzyme family (EF) may undergo expansions [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] due to gene duplication, leading to paralogues, and/or horizontal gene transfer, leading to xenologues. The emerging extra gene copies may be retained in the genome when they provide an advantage, as they evolve into novel enzyme functions [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] serving as raw material for new metabolic pathways. Since genes involved in a metabolic pathway tend to cluster together in bacterial genomes, conserved genomic vicinity can be taken as an indication of related gene functionality [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], whereas phylogenetic reconstruction of these EFs can differentiate between conserved copies devoted to central metabolism [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and expansions recruited into NP biosynthesis or other metabolic adaptations.</p><p>To date, EvoMining has been used to show the occurrence of conserved EFs that fulfill related biochemical functions with different physiological roles [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16, 20</xref>]. It has also been used for the discovery of NP BGCs with unprecedented biosynthetic enzymes essential for the synthesis of arsenolipids in <italic><named-content content-type="genus">
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1601/nm.6817">Streptomyces</ext-link>
</named-content></italic> [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As a related but independent follow-up of EvoMining, we have very recently released a phylogenomic approach, termed CORe Analysis of Syntenic Orthologs to prioritize Natural product BGCs, or <sc>corason</sc>. This algorithm addresses the evolutionary relationships between BGCs, allowing one to comprehensively identify all genomic vicinities in which particular biosynthetic gene cassettes are found [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Based on similar evolutionary ideas to those embraced by EvoMining, the Antibiotic Resistance Target Seeker, or <sc>arts</sc> [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], exploits the fact that some antibiotics function by interfering with central metabolic enzymes and, therefore, antibiotic-producing bacteria have mechanisms of self-protection encoded in extra gene copies. Although examples of the discovery of novel biosynthetic systems using <sc>corason</sc> or <sc>arts</sc> remain to be reported, these approaches together with EvoMining add to the growing notion that evolutionary paradigms can aid in the discovery of antibiotics [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Although elegant in their simplicity, the aforementioned evolutionary ideas oversimplify a far more complex scenario in which different evolutionary histories can involve different metabolic origins and fates [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For instance, the boundaries of central metabolism are hard to define, as conserved or core enzymes of genomic lineages tend to differ broadly [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], even within closely related clades or organisms [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, not all extra copies of expanded enzymes are recruited into specialized metabolism, as previously highlighted as a criticism of EvoMining [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some of the expanded EFs may remain in central metabolism providing a certain level of metabolic redundancy, as it is the case of pyruvate kinases in glycolysis [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or ketol-acid reductoisomerases in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in <italic><named-content content-type="genus">
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1601/nm.6817">Streptomyces</ext-link>
</named-content></italic> species. Alternatively, expanded EFs could serve other physiological roles related to morphological development [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or may represent metabolic adaptations that involve the use of different cofactors as in GDH of Archaea species [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13, 28</xref>]. Although EvoMining overcomes the latter caveats by prioritizing extra copies that are similar in sequence to enzymes from NP BGCs with genome neighbourhood or vicinity support, there is much to be understood about the evolution of enzymes during the assembly of BGCs directing the synthesis of NPs.</p><p>An open question along these lines is whether we can identify novel enzymes that define a completely new class of BGCs, rather than only identifying accessory or precursor-supply enzymes. To address this question, here we developed EvoMining to allow customization of its DBs. We then performed a systematic analysis of expansion-and-recruitment events in different Archaea and Bacteria lineages, including divergent taxa (<named-content content-type="phylum">

Selected results were visualized with <sc>corason</sc> [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as a feature that can be integrated into EvoMining, depicting the evolutionary dynamics leading to new BGCs.

Our results directed us to rethink EvoMining to incorporate &#x02018;shell&#x02019; enzymes [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast with core EFs, with a copy in every genome of a given lineage, shell EFs are defined by 50&#x0200a;% conservation. By better understanding the origin and fate of metabolic enzymes, we demonstrate that expansion-and-recruitment profiles of EFs are taxa dependent, and that these observations relate to shell enzymes, which have great potential for the discovery of novel NP BGCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1-5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>EvoMining container</title><p>EvoMining version 2.0 was developed as a standalone comparative genome-mining tool using Perl as the coding language and Docker [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] as the packaging platform.

For this work, we adopted our previous approximation to describe significant expansions [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>], defined as at least one genome with an enzyme copy number beyond the mean plus two standard deviations. The resulting expansions are presented by EvoMining in a heat plot (Fig. S1), available with the online version of this article), which pinpoints, for each EF, all the organisms that have extra copies and significant expansions. It should be noted that not all extra copies are expansions, but may nevertheless be EvoMining predictions (see Results and Discussion). An advice for users, evolutionary patterns are better appreciated after reordering organisms in the heat plot as they appear in a species tree. Expanded EFs are then <sc>blastp</sc> queried using an <italic>E</italic> value 0.001 against a DB of NP biosynthetic enzymes (NP DB) or MIBiG [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

As a result, the three EvoMining inputs, (i) Genome DB, (ii) Enzyme DB (originally called PSCP, from Precursor Supply Central Pathways) and (iii) NP DB, can be modified, replaced or expanded by the user (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a)</xref>. For each EF, the pipeline produces an interactive, colour-coded tree of the expanded EF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b)</xref>. Colours in the tree show information about the metabolic origin and/or fate of homologous enzymes present in the Genome DB. Red stands for central metabolism, which can be orange if it coincides with the seed enzyme; purple is used for transition enzymes; grey for expansions of unknown origin and/or fate; cyan for antiSMASH hits; blue for MIBiG recruitments; and green for EvoMining predictions. Visualization of the genomic vicinities in which each of these enzymes is encoded can be displayed. Thus, the newly incorporated changes allow, at a glance, exploration of the evolutionary dynamics of EFs, from central to different forms of specialized metabolism, with an emphasis on NP biosynthesis.

The concept of shell enzymes and its potential to unveil novel pathways is then presented. As further discussed, we define core EFs as those with a copy in every genome of a lineage, whereas shell EFs are defined as those enzymes that are shared by more than 50&#x0200a;% of the genomes of any given genomic lineage. Second, the scytonemin BGC is characterized as an example of the potential and intrinsic features of the EvoMining algorithm. The selection of this BGC follows the fact that it is composed of atypical biosynthetic enzymes that happened to be included within the 42 EFs analysed herein, namely, GDH and ALS. These EFs were detected by EvoMining as having originated in central metabolism, with their fate in specialized metabolism or central metabolic pathways related to adaptive physiologies involving different cofactors, depending on the taxon analysed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6-2"><title>Enzyme expansion profiles are lineage dependent</title><p>To further gain insights into the evolution of enzymes and the pathways in which they take part, we exploited the taxonomic coverage of the selected lineages.

Indeed, even when the 42 EFs were found conserved throughout the seed genomes selected for each of the four taxa investigated, certain enzymes were not present in some of the genomes not used as seed organisms, but included in the Genome DB. Yet, the independent expansion profiles of each EF, in general, showed the same pattern as that recorded overall, with <italic><named-content content-type="genus">

However, there are certain families that do not follow this trend, including some of the eight selected cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3(a)</xref>. For instance, GDH is one of the four EFs with the largest number of expansions in Archaea. Moreover, GDH has less than one copy per genome in the other three taxa, to the point that this EF is not part of the core of these lineages. This contrasts with AroB, which shows extra copies and a mean copy number beyond one in all four genomic lineages analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b)</xref>.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>EvoMining profiles of selected conserved enzymes.

Although Archaea tends to be the least expanded taxa, this tendency reverts in the GDH family. (<bold>b)</bold> An example of a core versus a shell EF is provided.

Furthermore, as a consequence of this behaviour not unique to GDH, and to allow evolutionary analysis of selected enzymes within the scytonemin BGC, we focused on conserved EFs with extra copies beyond the mode. This criterion is different to that used for significant expansions, as defined in Methods, but allows calling for (shell) enzymes with interesting EvoMining profiles, opening the door to better understanding the origin and fate of biosynthetic enzymes. A conceptual scheme explaining the differential behaviours of GDH and AroB, where the differences between extra copies and significant expansions is emphasized, is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3(b)</xref>.</p><p>We also found that our GDH EvoMining results included antiSMASH predictions for <named-content content-type="phylum">

Thus, based on these observations, we specifically investigated the relationship between BGCs, expansion profiles and genomic lineages and, thus, we expanded our analyses to the ALS EF, which is one of the 42 conserved enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a)</xref>. Together with TrpA, TrpB, TrpC, TrpD, TrpEG and AroB (analysed in following sections), which are conserved amongst the 42 EFs, GDH and ALS have been recruited by the scytonemin BGC [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>], but not by the pactamycin BGC [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2-6-4"><title>EFs from the same BGC may experience different evolutionary dynamics: the case of GDH and ALS</title><p>The enzyme GDH, distributed in all domains of life because of both an ancestral origin and horizontal gene transfers [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28, 42</xref>] (Fig. S12), catalyses the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate into &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate and ammonia. This EF exists in three classes according to their use of cofactors. The first class uses NAD+ and&#x02009;it is referred to as GDH(NAD+). The second class utilizes NADP+ and&#x02009;it is known as GDH(NADP+). And the third class uses both NAD+ and NADP+;&#x02009;it is, therefore, referred to as GDH(NAD+ and NADP+) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, GDH enzymes are very diverse and can be divided according to their taxonomic distribution and structural features [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, although this GDH classification reflects more closely on the evolutionary history of this enzyme, for the sake of simplicity we adopted for our analysis the three GDH classes according to their cofactor specificity. GDH(NAD+) is utilized for glutamate oxidation and GDH(NADP+) for fixing ammonia, although some enzymes from Archaea can perform equally well with both cofactors [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. NAD or NADP specificity has probably emerged repeatedly, as it has been shown that a few mutations can reverse specificity [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

In addition to regulatory genes, this BGC includes the main biosynthetic genes, <italic>scyABC</italic>; tailoring-enzyme genes involved in late dimerization and oxidation steps, <italic>scyDEF</italic>; and in some cases, genes involved in precursor supply, namely, <italic>tyrA</italic>, <italic>dsbA</italic>, <italic>aroB</italic>, <italic>trpE/G</italic>, <italic>trpC</italic>, <italic>trpA</italic>, <italic>tyrP, trpB</italic>, <italic>trpD</italic>, <italic>aroG</italic>. The enzymes TrpABCDEG and AroB are part of the aromatic amino acid and shikimic acid pathways, and they seem to provide precursors for the synthesis of scytonemin in the form of <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan and prephenate. Interestingly, ScyA and ScyB have an origin in central metabolism, as they are homologues of ALS and GDH, but they have evolved different substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). ALS joins two pyruvates, leading to S-2-acetolactate [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while ScyB joins indole-3-pyruvate with <italic>p</italic>-hydroxy-phenyl-pyruvic acid. Analogously, but in central metabolism, GDH converts <sc>l</sc>-glutamate into 2-oxoglutarate [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while ScyA catalyses an oxidative deamination of tryptophan. The product of these two enzymes, acting sequentially, is a dipeptide, which is cyclized by ScyC. The pathway finishes with a series of oxidations and a dimerization step to yield scytonemin [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Metabolic origin and fate of GDH/ScyA and ALS/ScyB and scytonemin biosynthesis. AroG and AroB participate in the synthesis of chorismate, an intermediary that is transformed in the precursors leading to ScyA substrates, i.e. <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan and prephenate. The reaction catalysed by ScyB converting tryptophan into indole-3-pyruvate is similar to the conversion of <sc>l</sc>-glutamate into 2-oxoglutarate, catalysed by GDH (square with a solid outline). ScyA catalyses the decarboxylation of indole-3-pyruvate and <italic>p</italic>-hydroxy-phenyl-pyruvic acid (p-HPP) to form a dipeptide that serves as a scytonemin precursor. This reaction is analogous to the decarboxylation of two pyruvates by the original ALS enzyme (rectangle with a dotted outline). ScyC performs a cyclization followed by oxidation and dimerization steps that conclude with the scytonemin pathway. Enzymes in the scytonemin BGC devoted to synthesis of precursors are coloured in brown and scytonemin biosynthetic enzymes are coloured in blue.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mgen-5-260-g006"/></fig><p>In addition to GDH and ALS, 6 of the EFs that are present in the scytonemin BGC are part of the 42 EFs analysed herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>a, Table S3). All of them have an origin in central metabolism and have been recruited into the scytonemin BGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref> and S3&#x02013;S9). From these, six of the seven EvoMining trees contain expansions that turned out to be EvoMining predictions, as the expansion branches include scytonemin genes, an indication of specialized metabolism. These families include AroB, as well as all of the genes of the <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, other than <italic>trpF.</italic> The EvoMining predictions include enzymes from other sunscreen biosynthetic systems, such as shinorine and mycosporine-like amino acids [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] (Fig. S8), as well as other unrelated NPs, including welwitindolinone [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], ambiguine [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and fischerindoline [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] (Figs S3&#x02013;S7). These results illustrate how EvoMining can complement antiSMASH by identifying sequences that belong to non-traditional NP BGCs, even when substrate specificity has not been changed. To further investigate the presumed co-evolution of ScyA and ScyB, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of these enzymes by concatenating their sequences, and contrasting the resulting phylogenetic reconstruction with the genomic vicinity of their cognate BGC, using <sc>corason</sc> [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The resulting phylogenomic analysis revealed 34 cyanobacterial organisms with chemical diversity around their scytonemin BGC.</p><p>We could predict five additional putative chemical structures related to scytonemin, which correlate with episodes of gene loss-and-gain at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The incorporation of genes that encode other enzymes, such as hydrolases (blue pattern), prenyltransferases (yellow pattern), phosphodiesterases (purple pattern) and monooxygenases (pink pattern), could be forming the congeners of scytonemin compounds 1 and 2. Moreover, gene losses related to the enzymes ScyDEF and the appearance of other enzymes, such as tyrosinase (grey pattern) and/or an amidase (orange pattern) might be driving the synthesis of compounds 3 and 4. We also found that <italic>scyA</italic> and <italic>scyB</italic> are part of a BGC that contains a hybrid NRPS-PKS (green and black pattern, respectively). Following biosynthetic logics related to these enzymes, a predicted compound 5 is proposed. The chemical diversity suggested by these predictions, which can only be validated by further experimental characterization, emphasizes the evolutionary dynamics of specialized metabolism. Notably, these dynamics were traceable by means of using ScyA and ScyB as sequence beacons. These results suggest the increased predictive power of EvoMining for opening new metabolic spaces typically overlooked by standard NP genome mining approaches.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>Phylogenomic analysis of <italic>scyA</italic> and <italic>sycB</italic> showed chemical diversity around the scytonemin BGC.

Our analyses lead to the conclusion that expansion-and-recruitment events are both EF and genomic lineage dependent, an important consideration when using EvoMining. Although genome size seems to matter, we also found exceptions where EvoMining could predict novel BGCs in relatively small genomes, suggesting that further analyses are needed to assess this relationship. Along these lines, we opted to compare genomic lineages that are not only highly divergent, and in some cases poorly understood with regards to NP biosynthesis, but also disproportionate in terms of their taxonomic resolution and distances. Thus, it is possible that these factors could have imposed a bias when establishing relationships between genome size, the rate of gene expansions and metabolic diversity.</p><p>After comprehensively analysing GDH, an EF notably expanded in Archaea but not in other taxa, we provide an example of a recruitment of a central metabolic enzyme by a NP BGC, as well as by other metabolic pathways. It is interesting to note that the most expanded EF in previous EvoMining proof-of-concept analyses [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] were asparagine synthase, 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphoheptanoate aldolase and 3-phosphoshikimate-1-carboxivinyl transferase, which lead to the discovery of unprecedented arsenolipid biosynthetic enzymes. Notably, none of these enzymes were part of the 42 EFs analysed herein, reinforcing the notion that not only conserved enzymes, but also shell enzymes with extra copies, can serve as beacons for the discovery of novel NP BGCs. These observations emphasize the predictive nature of EvoMining, which became apparent only after the origin and fate of enzymes could be traced back to evolutionary events at different levels, from genome dynamics involving large loci, to different mutations rates at the protein sequence level.</p><p>EvoMining users, therefore, should define beforehand the most appropriate EF to be used for a certain taxonomic group. The selected Enzyme DB should contain a set of EFs where expansion patterns could be detected. In turn, EFs with a distribution restricted to a small percentage of genomes are not suitable for EvoMining analysis. It is also important to determine which EFs are shared by most of the genomes within the genomic lineages of interest, and whether this is important for the type of EvoMining analyses to be performed. The original EvoMining DB included manually curated EFs only involving central metabolic enzymes, but, as it was demonstrated here, these did not necessarily represent the core enzymatic repertoire of <named-content content-type="phylum">
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1601/nm.5711">Actinobacteria</ext-link>
</named-content>. This relates to the difficulty of defining what is central metabolism; thus, we prefer to use the term core enzymes at different thresholds of conservation. In our case, we used 50&#x0200a;% to define shell enzymes. This notion implies the possibility of automatizing Enzyme DB integration by selecting for EFs in any given genomic lineage, avoiding the need to arbitrarily define what is central metabolism.</p><p>Another key point in EvoMining success relates to the improvement of the NP DB due to the availability of MIBiG [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The previous EvoMining version did not include a cyanobacterial NP BGC, and for this reason only this EvoMining version could identify hits for the ScyA and ScyB branches. Nevertheless, in the absence of the signals provided by MIBiG, the extra copies of these EFs would have been marked by EvoMining as expansions not involved in central metabolism. This maybe the case in Archaea, where some sequences in the GDH tree are labelled as such, possibly related to terpenes as well as to other metabolic fates yet-to-be discovered. The presence of only one Archaea BGC at MIBiG is clearly due to the limited research available of the potential of Archaea to synthesize NPs, as our results suggest that current methods based on previous knowledge from unrelated taxa impose biases that hamper our ability to unlock the metabolic diversity of this domain of life. We anticipate that this situation will be overcome by EvoMining, as it is a less-biased and rule-independent approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1-7"><title>Data Bibliography</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Nelly S&#x000e9;lem-Mojica.
