In the current study, as a first attempt, we examined the hypothesis that visual inputs during high-speed driving would activate the mesolimbic dopaminergic system that plays an important role in mediating motivational craving. To this end, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify speed-related activation changes in mesolimbic dopaminergic regions during the observation of driver-view videos in two groups that differed in self-reported speeding propensity. Results revealed, as we expected, greater activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in response to driver-view videos with higher speed. Contrary to our expectation, however, we found no significant between-group difference in speed-related activation changes in mesolimbic dopaminergic regions. Instead, an exploratory psychophysiological interaction analysis found that self-reported speeding propensity was associated with speed-related functional coupling between the VTA and the right intraparietal sulcus. Further validation of our hypothesis will require future studies examining associations between speed-related activation in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and individual differences in speeding propensity, using a more reliable measure of actual speeding propensity in real traffic.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The propensity for speeding is widespread. To our knowledge, all motorized countries have penal rules for excessive speeding. These rules are typically based on the premise that people often fail to stay within designated speed limits, reflecting the common propensity for speeding among drivers. Interestingly, speed-related vehicle specifications are often emphasised as a major contributing factor of <italic>driving pleasure</italic>, particularly in the context of car advertising<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This is also indicative of the prevailing propensity for speeding in the general population.</p><p id="Par3">Despite the ubiquity and importance of speeding offenses, there has been very little neuroscience research regarding speeding propensity. Beeli <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> reported that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reduced the number of speeding violations in a simulated driving environment. This suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in risk aversion or legal compliance in car driving situations, but does not provide information about the underlying neural mechanisms of speeding propensity per se. Meanwhile, Erk <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> explored brain activation in response to images of various types of car, revealing that the ventral striatum was selectively activated by images of sports cars. Sports cars are a symbol of high speed, and the ventral striatum is known to be part of the reward system in the brain, constituting a crucial structure for behavioural motivation. Thus, these findings suggest the possibility that car-related visual cue responses in the ventral striatum might be associated with speeding propensity. However, because sports cars are also a cultural icon signalling wealth and social dominance, Erk <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> concluded that the ventral striatum activation they observed in response to images of sports car may be likely to reflect brain responses to cultural properties of objects. Although many studies have identified brain regions associated with different aspects of car driving<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, no previous studies have directly investigated the issue of speeding propensity.</p><p id="Par4">In the current study, as a first attempt to identify the neural substrates underlying speeding propensity, we hypothesised that sensory inputs during high-speed driving would activate the brain reward system. Humans commonly crave sensory inputs that give rise to pleasant sensations, and abundant evidence indicates that the craving for pleasant sensations is associated with activation within the brain reward system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings suggest that the sensory cue reactivity in the brain reward system is critical for craving. To validate our hypothesis, we used functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) to explore activation in response to visual inputs during high-speed driving within mesolimbic dopaminergic regions, the core of the brain reward system. This study had two specific aims: (1) to examine speed-related activation changes in mesolimbic dopaminergic regions of interest (ROIs) during the observation of driver-view videos and (2) to compare speeding-related activation changes between two groups that would be expected to differ in speeding propensity (participants with and without a self-reported interest in sports cars).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Group characteristics</title><p id="Par5">Participants&#x02019; self-reported usual speed on expressways with a speed limit of 100&#x02009;km/h was significantly higher for participants who had high interest in sports cars, compared with those who had no interest (no interest: mean (M)&#x02009;=&#x02009;105, standard error (SE)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x02009;km/h; high interest: M&#x02009;=&#x02009;119, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x02009;km/h, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>).

This notion is consistent with an animal study reporting that visual stimuli containing rich global motion signals (i.e., action movies) are a more effective reinforcer of operant reactions, compared with still images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">The absence of speed-related activation in the NAc may provide further insight into the interpretation of speed-related VTA activation. The VTA is known to be activated not only by reward relevance of stimuli but also by stimulus novelty. Krebs <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> investigated functional segregation within the VTA using high-resolution fMRI, and found two distinct subregions that exhibited different response characteristics in terms of reward relevance and novelty of stimuli. While one was sensitive to reward relevance rather than novelty, just as it was for the NAc, the other was sensitive to novelty rather than reward relevance. Such a novelty-sensitive response was also found in part of the ventral stream of the visual system, including the fusiform gyrus and the parahippocampal area. In the current study, ROI and whole-brain analyses revealed that the VTA was co-activated with the ventral visual stream regions but not with the NAc. From a computational point of view, novelty-induced dopaminergic activity is interpreted as an <italic>exploration bonus</italic> that motivates animals to seek novel stimuli and situations for future reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In this context, our data suggest that VTA activation in response to visual inputs representing higher mobility can be a motivational driving force of environmental exploration, and therefore that speeding propensity might be a side effect of such exploratory motivation.</p><p id="Par12">Speed-related activation changes in the VTA did not differ between participants with no interest and participants with high interest in sports cars. Although there were significant between-group differences in self-reported driving speeds, those metrics may not have reflected the actual speeding propensity in real traffic. In fact, the number of speeding offenders was similar between the two groups. In addition, although risky driving tendencies, including speeding violations, have been reported to be associated with sensation-seeking personality traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, we found no significant between-group differences in SSS scores. Further validation of our hypothesis will require future studies to examine the associations between speed-related VTA activation and individual differences in speeding propensity. Group comparisons using a more reliable measure of actual speeding propensity in real traffic are desirable for future research. Combination of neuroimaging with recent technologies for recording naturalistic driving<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> could provide a valuable methodology.</p><p id="Par13">Our exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed speed-related changes in bilateral putamen activation. The putamen is also known to be a dopamine-rich brain structure that responds to reward-related sensory cues. Specifically, one study has shown putamen activation when people who received a monotonous diet before fMRI scanning imagined their favorite foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In another study, putamen activation in response to food pictures were positively correlated with the subjective feeling of appetite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a study has shown that smoking abstinence in smokers (which creates increased craving for smoking) potentiated putamen activation in response to photographic smoking cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that the speed-related changes in putamen activation that we observed support our hypothesis that sensory inputs during high-speed driving modify activation within the brain-reward system.</p><p id="Par14">The whole-brain analysis also revealed speed-related activation changes within the dorsal stream, as well as the ventral stream, of the visual system. In general, the dorsal visual stream is considered critical for visual-guided actions. In our experimental task, although driving-related actions (e.g., steering and using pedals) were not required, visual-guided eye movements were expected to occur because participants were asked to view the video clips as if they were the driver. Several previous studies have demonstrated that during curve negotiation, drivers keep looking at the tangent point (or its close vicinity) on the inside edges of bends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, although eye movements were not collected during fMRI scanning in this study, it is likely that pursuit eye movements to the tangent points occurred during the task blocks, and that their velocity and frequency were greater in the fast compared with the slow condition. Therefore, speed-related activation within the dorsal visual stream may be associated with driving-related eye movements. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that greater activation with increased driving speed in the frontal eye field and the cerebellar vermis because these regions are well known to play a role in pursuit eye movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">Meanwhile, the exploratory PPI analysis revealed a greater functional coupling of the VTA with the medial PFC in the fast condition than in the slow condition. Functional connectivity between these two regions has been reported in a previous resting state fMRI study in healthy individuals, using the VTA as a seed region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, according to a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies regarding positive aesthetic appraisal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, medial PFC contains a mosaic of small regions that are sensitive to positive valence of sensory inputs from different modalities. More specific to the vision, the medial PFC is known to be highly active when we look at beautiful paintings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, abstract figures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and mathematical equations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. These lines of evidence lead us to speculate that speed-related functional coupling between the VTA and the medial PFC is related to a favorable feeling towards the visual input generated by high-speed driving. However, because participants in the current study were not required to judge the favorableness of visual stimuli, further studies are needed to assess this possibility.</p><p id="Par16">Interestingly, the PPI analysis also identified a significant group difference in speed-related functional connectivity between the VTA and the right IPS. To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported contextual modulation of functional coupling between these regions. The IPS is known to play a crucial role in attentional control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, one interpretation of the result is that greater attention to visual inputs during high-speed driving in individuals with a greater propensity for speeding positively modulates the functional coupling between the VTA and the right IPS. This explanation seems to be aligned with the theoretical framework of craving (called attentional bias), in which reward-related sensory cues tend to grab the attention of people who have strong cravings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, this is merely a reverse inference based on a functional role of the IPS and therefore needs to be clarified.</p><p id="Par17">This study involved several limitations that should be considered. First, pursuit eye movements during curve negotiation are a potential confounding factor in our measure of speed-related VTA activation although previous neuroimaging studies of pursuit eye movements have not shown the involvement of the VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Second, our study focused only on the visual aspects of sensory inputs during high-speed driving. Vestibular inputs such as linear acceleration and centrifugal force are also important sensory cues for high-speed driving, but were not taken into account in the present experiment. Even regarding visual inputs, the visual angle of stimulus movie clips employed in the present experiment was too small to reproduce the actual optical flow observed by drivers in real traffic. Thus, it would be valuable for future research to utilise more realistic sensory inputs during high-speed driving in an MRI environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par18">Thirty-four healthy young adults who drove on a daily basis (with at least 2 years of experience as a licensed driver; annual mileage &#x02265;5000&#x02009;km) participated in this study.
