The expression of <italic>OCT4</italic> in cancers has been challenged in many studies. The existence of several <italic>OCT4</italic> spliced variants and absence of specific discriminating primers is the main reason of this controversy. Therefore, using specific primers and discriminating <italic>OCT4</italic> variants from each other might help to reduce these discrepancies in carcinogenesis and stem cell researches.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>17 various human cancer, pluripotent and normal cells were cultured and their RNAs were extracted. Related cDNAs were synthesized and the expression pattern of <italic>OCT4</italic> variants was investigated by RT-PCR assay. PCR products were cloned into pTZ57R/T vector and their authenticity was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression pattern of <italic>OCT4</italic> variants (OCT4A, OCT4B and OCT4B1) was analyzed by RT-PCR assay and the authenticity of PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A novel spliced variant of <italic>OCT4</italic> was discovered and named as OCT4B3. This variant was very similar to OCT4B2 transcript except that 207-nt of exon 1b is lost. Moreover, the expression pattern of OCT4B3 variant was investigated in 17 human cell types, where its expression was only found in astrocytoma and bladder cancer cell types 1321N1 and 5637, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p><italic>OCT4</italic> variants are differentially expressed in various human cancer cell lines. Moreover, a novel variant of <italic>OCT4</italic>, OCT4B3, was detected in two human cancer cell lines of bladder carcinoma (5637) and brain astrocytoma (1321N1) for the first time.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>Cell lines</kwd><kwd>Gene</kwd><kwd>Stem cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>OCT4</italic> gene, an important stem cell marker, maintains stemness properties of Embryonic Stem (ES) and Embryonic Carcinoma (EC) cells <sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Up until now, it is known that <italic>OCT4</italic> pre-mRNA can produce various splice variants such as OCT4A, OCT4B, OCT4B1 and also OCT4B2 under different situations <sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The OCT4A isoform is known as a prominent factor that sustains self-renewal and pluripotency in ES and EC cells. Compared to OCT4A, OCT4B isoforms such as OCT4B-164, OCT4B-190 and OCT4B-265 cannot sustain stemness properties in mentioned cells and respond to the cell stresses. OCT4B1 is a newly discovered variant and is known to be expressed in undifferentiated stem cells and down-regulated during induction of differentiation <sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The existence of several <italic>OCT4</italic> spliced variants and 7 transcribed pseudogenes might interfere in detection and discrimination of OCT4A, the main pluripotency marker, from other <italic>OCT4</italic> gene products (spliced variants and pseudogenes) <sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.

This process permits a single gene to produce several transcripts and proteins with different functions in various tissues and conditions. Recent genome-wide analysis suggests that nearly 95% of human genes are alternatively spliced <sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In many cases, alternative splicing patterns are tissue specific events <sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, regulatory elements in the pre-mRNA sequence (introns and exons) are associated with tissue specificity of these splice variants <sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. <italic>OCT4</italic> gene can generate various isoforms by alternative splicing expressed in different tissues and have disparate functions <sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. For example, OCT4A is an important transcription factor that donates stemness properties to the ES and EC cells <sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. OCT4B-190 and OCT4B-265 are two other <italic>OCT4</italic> spliced variants that response to cell stress <sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. OCT4B1 is expressed in the stem cells and undifferentiated cells and suggests to be a stemness marker. OCT4B2 is expressed in different cancer cells and up-regulated under stress conditions, as well <sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Here, the expression pattern of known <italic>OCT4</italic> variants was investigated (OCT4A, OCT4B and OCT4B1) by RT-PCR assay. Our results indicated that OCT4A is expressed in pluripotent cells such as embryonic carcinoma cells (NT2 and NCCIT) and some other cancer cell lines. OCT4B and OCT4B1 transcripts were detected in the most of examined cells in this study.</p><p>Moreover, another <italic>OCT4</italic> spliced variant was introduced, OCT4B3 that is very similar to the OCT4B2 transcript which lacks 207-nt of exon 1b. This variant has a low expression as usual, and was detected in the human bladder cancer (5637) and astrocytoma (1321N1) cell lines. It was supposed that OCT4B2 might lose a 207-nt fragment of its Exon1b by splicing and generates OCT4B3 under special conditions. However, it needs more experimental evidences to confirm this hypothesis definitely. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that OCT4B3 transcript can produce a hypothetical protein which is the same with OCT4B-164 isoform and composed of POU<sub>H</sub> and N-Terminal (NTD) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Since cancer cell lines are a mixture of &#x0201c;cancer stem cells&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;cancer cells&#x0201d;, reflecting the complex mixture of these cancer stem cells, stromal cells and invasive immune cells in an <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor, internal special micro-environmental conditions affect a complex interaction of these cell types that induce the production of these various spliced variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using specific primers, we have discovered a novel variant of <italic>OCT4</italic>, named as OCT4B3. The sequence of the variant is very similar to OCT4B2 transcript, except that a 207-nt segment of exon 1b is lost in OCT4B3. The expression of the variant was detected in two human cancer cell lines of bladder carcinoma (5637) and brain astrocytoma (1321N1) cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We gratefully appreciate the Iranian Stem Cell Council (IRSCC) which provided the fund for this work.
