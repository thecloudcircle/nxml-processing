Because influenza infections are initiated in and localized to the pulmonary tract, and newly formed viral particles egress from the apical side of the lung epithelium, we compared the effectiveness of hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-binding bNAbs administered through the airway (intranasal or via nebulization) versus the systemic route (intraperitoneal or intravenous). Airway deliveries of various bNAbs were 10- to 50-fold more effective than systemic deliveries of the same bNAbs in treating H1N1, H3N2, B/Victoria-, and B/Yamagata-lineage influenza viral infections in mouse models. The potency of airway-delivered anti-HA bNAbs was highly dependent on antiviral neutralization activity, with little dependence on the effector function of the antibody. In contrast, the effectiveness of systemically delivered anti-HA bNAbs was not dependent on antiviral neutralization, but critically dependent on antibody effector functions. Concurrent administration of a neutralizing/effector function-positive bNAb via the airway and systemic routes showed increased effectiveness. The small amount of airway-delivered bNAbs needed for effective influenza treatment creates the opportunity to combine potent bNAbs with different anti-influenza specificities to generate a cost-effective antiviral therapy that provides broad coverage against all circulating influenza strains infecting humans. A 3&#x02009;mg/kg dose of the novel triple antibody combination CF-404 (i.e., 1&#x02009;mg/kg of each component bNAb) delivered to the airway was shown to effectively prevent weight loss and death in mice challenged with ten 50% lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) inoculums of either H1N1, H3N2, B/Victoria-lineage, or B/Yamagata-lineage influenza viruses.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Influenza causes widespread illness in humans and can result in morbidity and death, especially in the very young and elderly populations.

Additionally, the potential for devastating influenza pandemics across the human population is high (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The limited effectiveness of influenza vaccines is primarily due to the ability of the virus to rapidly mutate, giving rise to new variations each year that necessitate annual reformulations of the vaccine (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Currently available treatment options, such as neuraminidase inhibitors, suffer from resistance (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and the limited postinfection time frame in which they are effective (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). There remains an acute need for new anti-influenza therapeutics that provide a high degree of effectiveness and broad coverage of the influenza strains that infect humans.</p><p>Antibodies to influenza viruses can be effective therapeutically. Passive immunization using hyperimmune serum derived from convalescent plasma of patients who recovered from infections caused by the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus has been shown to be effective in suppressing viral load, as well as improving survival in infected patients (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize the head region of the influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein have been shown to be effective in treating influenza infections in animal models (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, HA head-specific MAbs are generally not broadly reactive across many influenza virus isolates (with notable exceptions [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), due to the large degree of strain-to-strain variability in the amino acid residues within the HA head region (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). An effective alternative approach is to identify MAbs that bind to the highly conserved stalk region of the influenza HA protein (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These stalk-specific MAbs are often broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), as they recognize the highly conserved epitopes within the HA stalk region. They prevent viral infection by inhibiting the pH-sensitive conformational change of the HA protein essential for the virus/cell fusion event (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and require Fc gamma receptor engagement for full activity when administered systemically (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps because of the effectiveness of the classic systemic passive immunization approaches using infused antisera, the general approach to delivering anti-influenza MAbs has been via the systemic route. However, because infections caused by influenza viruses are initiated in, and generally localized to, the respiratory tract (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), it is reasonable to consider the administration of anti-influenza virus therapies directly to the patient&#x02019;s airway. In an early study, Akerfeldt et al. observed approximately 50-fold enhanced efficacy of airway delivery over systemic delivery when using human gamma globulin to treat influenza infections in mice (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Clinically, airway delivery for influenza therapy has been employed for the administration of the marketed neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and in clinical trials for DAS-181, an enzyme-based sialidase fusion protein (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Airway delivery of purified anti-influenza MAbs has not been clinically tested to date.</p><p>Administration of MAbs (or antibody-like derivatives) directly to the airway through inhalation for treating respiratory diseases has been characterized for a number of systems (see reference <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> for review and the references within). Generally, the results of these studies indicate that exposure to aerosolized MAbs is well tolerated, with no or minor impact on activity of the therapeutic (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For example, airway delivery of cetuximab has been proposed for treating lung cancer (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and studies indicate that this antibody can be nebulized successfully with little effect on activity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Airway-delivered nebulized anti-VEGF murine IgG2a MAb G6-31 has been shown to be effective in models of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). An anti-IL-13 antibody Fab fragment can be nebulized with no loss of activity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and airway delivery of the Fab has been shown to be effective in models of chronic asthma (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). ALX-0171, an inhaled anti-RSV camelidae-derived nanobody, has been tested in clinical trials and appears to be well tolerated in humans (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). For anti-influenza treatment, HA stalk-binding bNAbs delivered intranasally have been shown to be effective in murine models of influenza (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the attributes necessary for anti-influenza viral effectiveness for both airway- and systemic&#x02013;delivered bNAbs. The findings indicate that the neutralization and effector function engagement requirements are different for anti-influenza antibodies delivered via the airway versus those administered by the systemic route. Because of the orthogonal mechanisms of action of the two administration routes, we found relatively small amounts of effector function-positive bNAbs to be highly effective when dosed via the airway and systemic routes simultaneously. Given that the potency of airway-delivered bNAbs is at least one log greater than that of systemic-delivered bNAbs, there is an opportunity to combine several bNAbs and deliver them at relatively low doses via the airway to achieve broad coverage against multiple influenza strains. Here, we characterize CF-404, an inhaled three-bNAb combination that effectively treats infections caused by the circulating influenza strains commonly infecting humans, covering influenza A (IAV) groups 1 and 2 and both lineages of influenza B (IBV).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Airway delivery of anti-influenza bNAbs is more effective than systemic delivery for treating IAV and IBV infections.</title><p>Anti-influenza antibodies CR6261 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), CR8020 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and 5A7 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) were generated containing protein sequences identical to published sequences and are designated CR6261*, CR8020*, and 5A7*, respectively (see the Materials and Methods section). These antibodies are human IgG1 and should exhibit similar relative Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated biological activities in mouse models of disease (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Using a mouse model of influenza infection, we compared the therapeutic effectiveness of the anti-IAV-group 1 stalk-binding bNAb CR6261* (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) when delivered by different routes of administration. With CR6261* administered at 24&#x02009;h post-H1N1 viral infection, improvements in molar potency on the order of greater than 50-fold were observed for intranasal (i.n.) delivery compared to systemic delivery via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The weight loss profiles of the 10&#x02009;mg/kg i.p.- and 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg i.n.- dosed cohorts, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) analysis, were not significantly different, although the shape of the curves are clearly distinct (see the Discussion section). When a similar experiment was performed using a potent IAV-group 2 H3N2 virus and treatment with the stalk-binding anti-IAV-group 2 bNAb CR8020* (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), improvements in potency for the i.n.-delivered bNAb over the same bNAb delivered via the i.p. route was greater than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Similarly, when the anti-IBV stalk-binding bNAb 5A7* (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) was used to treat either IBV-Victoria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) or Yamagata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) lineage infections, improvements in potency for the i.n.-delivered bNAb over the same bNAb delivered via the i.p. route was greater than 50-fold.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><p>Airway delivery of anti-influenza bNAbs is more effective than systemic delivery for treating IAV and IBV infections.

However, when the defenses fail to provide adequate protection, newly replicated influenza virions are almost exclusively shed from the apical (airway-facing) side of infected lung epithelial cells (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). The asymmetric distribution of virions at the airway side of the lung epithelia, both at the beginning of the infection and persisting once the infection progresses, provides a rationale for administering anti-influenza HA antibodies to the airway side of the lung epithelia. It also provides a reason for why the neutralization attribute is critical for maximal efficacy of airway-delivered bNAbs, as neutralization of viral infectivity prevents the infection of lung epithelial cells, thereby effectively suppressing the initiation, and therefore the extent, of the viral infection.</p><fig id="F11" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 11</label><caption><p>Polarized lung epithelial cell topology dictates differential treatment outcomes for influenza bNAbs administered via different routes.

Only a small fraction of airway-deposited protein therapeutics cross the lung epithelial barrier and enter the bloodstream (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Similarly, only small amounts of systemically administered protein therapeutics cross the lung epithelial barrier and enter the airway (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). As a result, the vast majority of systemically administered antibodies primarily access the infected lung epithelial cells from the basolateral side. There they recognize viral antigens displayed on infected lung epithelial cells and engage NK and macrophage cells through the effector functions encoded by the antibody&#x02019;s Fc region (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), thereby facilitating the killing of virally infected cells. This provides an explanation for why effector function is critical for bNAb efficacy when administered through systemic routes. It also provides a rationale for the observation that neutralization is a relatively unimportant attribute for systemically administered bNAbs, as there are comparatively few viral particles at the basolateral side of the lung (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Because systemically administered bNAb doses are diluted throughout the vascular system of the treated host, relatively high doses must be administered to achieve effective bNAb concentrations at the site of action at the lung basolateral surface. This provides a rationale for the observed large differential in the dose levels required for efficacy between the airway-delivered and systemic-delivered anti-influenza bNAbs.</p><p>Consistent with this idea, we have observed a reproducible difference in the kinetic weight-loss profiles of airway-dosed versus systemic-dosed virally infected mice. An example of this weight-loss profile differential can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, comparing the low (0.1&#x02009;mg/kg) dose of the airway-delivered bNAb versus the high (10&#x02009;mg/kg) dose of the systemically administered bNAb. While the AUC analyses of these two curves yield similar values, the overall shapes are clearly different. The airway-administered low-dose profile shows initial weight-loss protection that persists until day 6 postinfection, followed by weight loss until the mice ultimately begin recovering at day 11. In contrast, the systemically dosed profile shows an initial weight loss indistinguishable from that of untreated mice which begins to stabilize at day 4 postinfection and begins recovering at day 7. Similar differential weight-loss patterns were observed in other experiments where systemic and airway administrations were compared (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). The two-log viral titer differential observed at day 3 postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>) demonstrates that infections taking place in systemically treated mice during the early times posttreatment were much more intense compared to the infections in airway-treated mice. These intense infections, with associated elevated cytokine levels, helped drive appetite suppression and the accompanying early weight losses seen in both the untreated and systemically treated mice.</p><p>The different weight-loss profiles seen between the two routes of administration and the day-3 viral titer differential may be explained by the fact there is a lag in the ability of the systemically delivered antibodies to exert their therapeutic effect because they primarily work by killing infected cells via effector-function-mediated cytotoxicity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Because cells must first become infected in order to engage the systemically administered bNAb&#x02019;s antiviral mechanism, systemically administered bNAbs exert their therapeutic effect relatively late in the overall infection cycle. In contrast, airway-delivered bNAbs directly neutralize the virus before infection rounds occur, thereby limiting the number of cells that become infected. The relative potency enhancement of airway-delivered bNAbs can be explained in part by attenuation of the amplification of the viral infection by direct neutralization of the virus at an early stage in the viral infection cycle, thereby limiting the rounds of cellular infection. Under experimental dose-limiting conditions where the weight-loss profile can be observed (e.g., the 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg i.n. dose in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), the protection afforded by the low dose of airway-delivered bNAb is not high enough to completely stop the infection and the virus ultimately breaks through over time, resulting in a delayed maximal infection giving rise to the observed kinetic weight-loss profile. But at higher doses, airway-delivered bNAbs neutralize a sufficient amount of virus present in the airway to protect the host from any weight loss due to the viral challenge.</p><p>While the outcomes for mice treated via the airway with the nonneutralizing antibody were not nearly as good as those treated with the neutralizing antibody, some of the nonneutralizing antibody-treated mice did survive, in contrast to the 0% survival rate for the untreated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>).

This difference is only significant at the lowest doses tested (0.1&#x02009;mg/kg) (<italic>P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;</italic>0.0001). It is not clear whether this difference is based on the presence of the Fc or the bivalent binding (and associated avidity enhancement) of the full IgG format. However, the somewhat diminished airway activity of the D265A mutant shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> may be consistent with Fc gamma receptor binding playing a role, because the D265A mutation abolishes binding to all Fc gamma receptors in mice (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It may be that the nonmutated form of the full-length IgG antibody binds to Fc gamma receptors on cells lining the airway tissue, prolonging the antibody airway residency time enough to confer apparent enhanced activity relative to the mutant D265A IgG form or the Fab forms (which have no Fc region).</p><p>The potency advantage of airway over systemic administration for therapeutic anti-influenza antibodies was demonstrated originally with human gamma globulin (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and later using monoclonal anti-HA-stalk antibodies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) for IAV infections. In a different respiratory viral model system, the cotton mouse model of RSV infection using IVIG as the therapeutic agent, a similar large efficacy differential was observed with airway treatment outperforming systemically administered treatments by 160-fold (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Similar to the influenza viral system (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), RSV viral particles also infect and bud from the apical side of the lung epithelial layer during viral infections (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The significant efficacy advantage afforded by airway delivery of therapeutic antibodies may hold for any respiratory viral system (such as SARS-CoV-2) where the virus exhibits asymmetric replication directed to the apical surface of lung epithelium.</p><p>Inflammatory cytokine levels are elevated in influenza-infected patients, causing discomfort, pain, and, in severe cases, life-threatening symptoms (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>, systemic delivery of bNAbs to treat influenza infections caused the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; levels to rise even higher than those seen in untreated infected animals. Because inflammatory cytokine production can be promoted by antibody engagement of Fc gamma receptors in conjunction with other stimulatory signals (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), the systemic administration of effector-function-positive HA-specific bNAbs to mice undergoing a proinflammatory influenza infection may cause heightened proinflammatory cytokine levels. In contrast, the mechanism of action of pulmonary-delivered bNAbs to treat influenza is independent of effector function and results in significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines compared to systemic delivery. The ability of airway-delivered bNAbs to suppress the levels of inflammatory cytokines is a positive aspect of this treatment option. This is an important factor when considering that influenza patients who may benefit from this treatment include immunocompromised or elderly individuals whose disease severity closely correlates with cytokine levels (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>Because the antiviral mechanisms of airway- and systemic-administered bNAbs are so different, we tested whether simultaneous coadministration of the same bNAb via the two different routes would provide a heightened benefit. The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> show that systemic doses at levels well below those needed for activity as a single systemically administered agent can significantly enhance the activity of a coadministered airway-delivered low bNAb dose. It appears that systemic bNAb doses that are too low to effectively treat ongoing high-level infections by themselves can augment therapies that limit the extent of viral infection (such as airway-delivered bNAbs). If the viral infection challenge is lowered enough (either by limiting the inoculum or limiting the infection level through viral neutralization by airway-localized bNAbs), it appears that only relatively low doses of systemically delivered bNAbs are needed to decrease the amplification of the viral replication cycle, presumably through the killing of infected cells. It is possible that prior exposure to influenza (including vaccination) induces sufficient systemic neutralizing antibody to potentiate the airway-localized antibody. If not, then it may be beneficial to treat patients with bNAbs simultaneously via both the airway and systemic routes. Additionally, airway delivery of bNAbs might be productively combined with currently marketed small molecule anti-influenza therapies, such as neuraminidase or polymerase inhibitors (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), which have very different mechanisms of action.</p><p>Recent clinical trials testing HA stalk-binding antibody therapies for treating influenza employ systemic administration of a single bNAb (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In <italic>in vivo</italic> IAV challenge trials in humans, efficacy of a systemically administered bNAb requires doses on the order of 40 to 50&#x02009;mg/kg or &#x0223c;3 g for an average-sized 70-kg adult patient (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). As a result, this therapeutic approach is limited in practice to a single bNAb, due to the high costs of goods and the administration volume that can be readily delivered. However, because bNAbs delivered via the airway can effectively prevent and treat influenza infections when delivered at doses on the order of 1&#x02009;mg/kg in mouse models, it is of interest to consider airway administration of a combination of relatively small amounts of bNAbs in order to achieve potent protection against all influenza viruses that infect humans. We have created a bNAb combination therapeutic termed CF-404, which is comprised of three bNAbs that have reactivities against IAV group 1 (CF-401), IAV group 2 (CF-402), and both lineages (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) of IBVs (CF-403). Each individual bNAb that comprise the CF-404 combination was selected based on its ability to neutralize a broad range of viruses in their respective viral types with high potency (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Although the dimeric IgA format, which is naturally found in mucosal secretions, could be considered, the IgG format was chosen because recombinant dimeric IgA is not easily produced at scale (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). When administered to mice at 3&#x02009;mg/kg (1&#x02009;mg/kg of each constituent bNAb) via the airway, CF-404 is highly effective against high viral challenges (10&#x000d7; LD<sub>50</sub>) of either IAV group 1, IAV group 2, IBV-Victoria lineage, or IBV-Yamagata lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). By exploiting the high potency afforded by airway administration, it is possible to create a single therapeutic agent that provides broad coverage against all classes of circulating influenza viruses that infect humans at a feasibly administrable dose.</p><p>For successful administration of nebulized protein biologics to the airway, it is important to establish optimal formulation and nebulization conditions that stabilize the protein during the nebulization process so that the integrity of the protein deposited in the lung is maintained (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). We have developed suitable nebulization conditions for the triple bNAb therapeutic combination CF-404 and have used nebulized CF-404 to successfully treat H1N1 infections in the mouse influenza infection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). The efficacies of intranasally administered and nebulized inhaled treatments were found to be comparable at equal lung-deposited doses. While the majority of the studies presented here were performed using i.n. administration, similar results are likely to be achievable with nebulized bNAbs dosed at comparable levels, since the lung concentration of the MAb is similar from both routes of administration. In one published study, even though an aerosol-delivered bNAb was therapeutically effective, it was found to penetrate less deeply into the mouse airway system than those delivered intranasally (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, the specific details of how the aerosol is generated (e.g., droplet size) greatly affect the extent to which aerosols are deposited into the lung tissue compartments (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), so it is difficult to directly compare our results with those of that study due to uncontrolled differences in specific experimental details.</p><p>While single bNAbs that neutralize most IAV isolates covering both groups 1 and 2 have been developed and are being tested clinically (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), none of these bNAbs can neutralize IBV strains. Although IBV has not caused pandemics to date, in some years IBV can be the predominant circulating influenza strain in certain geographic regions (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) and IBV infections can be as severe as or even more severe than infections due to IAV (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), especially in pediatric populations. For example, in the 2010 to 2011 season, IBV caused 25% of the influenza cases, while it was the cause of 38% of the pediatric deaths (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Additionally, the well-established anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir is less effective in treating IBV infections than IAV infections (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), although this issue is addressed with a class of recently introduced viral polymerase inhibitors (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Therefore, because the airway delivery route is highly effective and enables the combination approach, we include the anti-IBV bNAb CF-403 (also known as TRL-849 [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) in the antibody combination CF-404 to address prevalent and sometimes deadly IBV infections. IBV coverage is also a feature of a recently reported multispecific anti-influenza biologic (joined camelid domains) that provides broad coverage across multiple influenza viral types in preclinical studies (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>).</p><p>By exploiting the high efficacy of airway delivery, which allows for low doses, we have developed the novel triple antibody combination therapeutic, termed CF-404, that is designed to prevent and treat infections caused by IAV (both groups 1 and 2) and IBV (both Victoria and Yamagata lineages). Compared to the relatively narrow strain coverage of a single bNAb delivered using conventional systemic delivery, which requires a high dose, it is projected that exceptionally broad and potent coverage against strains that cause most influenza infections in humans can be achieved using the inhaled bNAb combination therapeutic candidate CF-404.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Antibodies.</title><p>All the MAbs used in this study were produced as recombinant MAbs and purified from HEK293 cell culture supernatants by standard methods.
