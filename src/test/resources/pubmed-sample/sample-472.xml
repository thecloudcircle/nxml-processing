As previous studies demonstrated that individuals with high subjective happiness level rated their current affective states more positively when they experience positive events, these two aspects of happiness are interrelated. According to a recent neuroimaging study, the cytosine to thymine single-nucleotide polymorphism of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 gene is associated with sensitivity to positive emotional stimuli. Thus, we hypothesized that our genetic traits, such as the human cannabinoid receptor 1 genotypes, are closely related to the two aspects of happiness. In Experiment 1, 198 healthy volunteers were used to compare the subjective happiness level between cytosine allele carriers and thymine-thymine carriers of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 gene. In Experiment 2, we used positron emission tomography with 20 healthy participants to compare the brain responses to positive emotional stimuli of cytosine allele carriers to that of thymine-thymine carriers. Compared to thymine-thymine carriers, cytosine allele carriers have a higher subjective happiness level. Regression analysis indicated that the cytosine allele is significantly associated with subjective happiness level. The positive mood after watching a positive film was significantly higher for the cytosine allele carriers compared to the thymine-thymine carriers. Positive emotion-related brain region such as the medial prefrontal cortex was significantly activated when the cytosine allele carriers watched the positive film compared to the thymine-thymine carriers. Thus, the human cannabinoid receptor 1 genotypes are closely related to two aspects of happiness. Compared to thymine-thymine carriers, the cytosine allele carriers of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 gene, who are sensitive to positive emotional stimuli, exhibited greater magnitude positive emotions when they experienced positive events and had a higher subjective happiness level.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (25750354 to MM).

Happiness as a scientific construct has been viewed as a temporary emotional state (hedonia) and a relatively stable state of being happy (eudaimonia) <xref rid="pone.0093771-Kozma1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Hedonia is usually experienced when we get the material objects and action opportunities we wish to possess or experience <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Otake1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, at the least, hedonia corresponds to a psychological state of pleasure and is greatly influenced by life events or circumstances, such as health, human relationships, household income, and housing conditions <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In contrast, according to previous studies, there is a relatively stable state of being happy, which is related to the sum of one's recent levels of affect, one's satisfaction with life, and disposition/propensity <xref rid="pone.0093771-Kozma1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although eudaimonia may be more difficult to define scientifically, at the least, it corresponds to a subjective assessment of one's life lived well (e.g., subjective well-being or subjective happiness level) rather than to an emotional feeling <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Lyubomirsky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Although there is a conceptual distinction between pleasure and subjective happiness level, these two aspects of happiness are interrelated. According to previous studies, individuals with a high subjective happiness level rated their current affective states more positively when they experience positive events <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Matsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Matsunaga2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Conversely, consecutive experiences of positive events also increased their subjective happiness level <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Seligman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Otake1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Psychologists have established two psychological models that explain the relationship between these two aspects of happiness: a top-down and a bottom-up model <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The top-down model assumes that individuals with a positive propensity, such as optimism, may evaluate their subjective happiness level and daily life events more positively than others who experience a similar number of positive life events <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In contrast, the bottom-up model suggests that hedonic experience in each of the life domains (e.g., household income, housing conditions) influence subjective happiness level positively <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, the sum of positive life events may be important for constructing a subjective happiness level. However, previous epidemiological data have suggested a more complex interaction between these two happiness components; there is both top-down and bottom-up processes in happiness processing <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, researchers have proposed a third psychological model, the up-down model, which allows for bidirectional interactions between the two happiness components <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have suggested that the human endocannabinoid system is associated with positive emotional processing <xref rid="pone.0093771-Chakrabarti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The endocannabinoid system refers to a group of neuromodulatory lipids <xref rid="pone.0093771-Moreira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The endocannabinoids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol <xref rid="pone.0093771-Devane1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> bind to brain cannabinoid receptors, which are involved in several physiological processes including appetite, nociception, mood, and memory <xref rid="pone.0093771-Moreira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The function of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is well known. In the brain, CB1 inhibits &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission presynaptically <xref rid="pone.0093771-Katona1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recent studies have demonstrated a role for CB1 in modulating the brain reward system; in fact, CB1 activation may induce dopamine release in the striatum including the nucleus accumbens <xref rid="pone.0093771-vanderStelt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Sperlgh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The human CB1 receptor gene (<italic>CNR1</italic>) is located at chromosome 6q14&#x02013;15 and there are multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <italic>CNR1</italic>; however, its effects on CB1 receptor function are still unclear <xref rid="pone.0093771-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A recent study indicated that a cytosine to thymine (C/T) SNP of <italic>CNR1</italic> (dbSNP number rs 806377), located in the untranslated exon 3, modulated striatal responses to happy faces <xref rid="pone.0093771-Chakrabarti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The striatal activity in the cytosine (C) allele carriers was higher than that in individuals with a thymine-thymine (TT) genotype when happy faces were presented <xref rid="pone.0093771-Chakrabarti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, suggesting that the C allele of the SNP of the <italic>CNR1</italic> may enhance CB1 activity.</p><p>Based on these previous observations, our genetic traits, such as the <italic>CNR1</italic> genotypes, are closely related to the two aspects of happiness. That is, compared to individuals with TT genotypes, C allele carriers of the SNP of <italic>CNR1</italic>, who are sensitive to positive emotional stimuli, may experience a higher magnitude pleasure response when they experience positive events and may have a higher subjective happiness level. In Experiment 1, to investigate the difference in subjective happiness level between C allele carriers and TT carriers, we assessed the subjective happiness level of 198 healthy participants. In Experiment 1, the participants were asked to evaluate their subjective happiness level using the Japanese version of the Subjective Happiness Scale (JSHS) <xref rid="pone.0093771-Matsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Matsunaga2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Shimai1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which included a subjective assessment of general happiness level and a subjective assessment of one's positive personal trait <xref rid="pone.0093771-Lyubomirsky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We predicted that subjective happiness level was higher in C allele carriers compared to TT carriers. Furthermore, in Experiment 2, we investigated the differences in brain responses and subjective ratings of temporal mood states between C allele carriers and TT carriers. To do so, we conducted a positron emission tomography (PET) study with an independent group of 20 healthy participants using the task of looking at one's favorite persons. Our previous PET study using the same task indicated that the act of looking at one's favorite persons evoked positive emotions <xref rid="pone.0093771-Matsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was positively correlated with the participants' self-rating of current positive mood states <xref rid="pone.0093771-Matsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, compared to TT carriers, we predicted that C allele carriers may evaluate their current mood state more positively and their mPFC may be activated to a greater degree when they looked at their favorite persons. Fortunately, the aim of this study was achieved through these experiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 198 healthy volunteers (76 males and 122 females; age range: 18&#x02013;40 years; age mean, 23.2&#x000b1;0.37 (standard error of the mean: SEM) years), following study approval by the Ethics Committee of Fujita Health University (previous affiliation of the first author; approval number: 09-018).

In brief, participants were instructed not to eat 2 h before the scanning session, but they were allowed to consume non-alcoholic and caffeine-free fluids. Either an emotionally neutral film (control film) or a film featuring people the participants considered attractive (positive film) was presented for 4 min on a 15-inch display positioned approximately 60 cm away from the participants. The PET (duration: 60 s) scans were performed in the first 2&#x02013;3 min of the screening. Mood states were evaluated before and after the screening. To obtain reliable PET data, each participant was assigned two distinct positive and two distinct control films, and four PET scans were obtained per participant. In order to assess the mood states of participants, they were asked to rate how positive their mood was before and after watching the films on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

In order to obtain the maximum effect, we did not standardize the actions performed by the actresses in the movies; the films did not contain erotic or sexually suggestive scenes. For example, one film contained scenes of their favorite person smiling. In addition, we compiled audiovisual clips because we thought that the favorite person's voice was important for the participants. The control film was a TV news program with a newscaster whom participants considered not so attractive. Since the newscaster reported past weather events, rather than new information, the participants were uninterested in the film.

Recent neuroimaging studies indicated that the mPFC is involved in the evaluation of self-related emotional events <xref rid="pone.0093771-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Buckner1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The dorsal part of the mPFC is involved in the monitoring of one' behaviors that enable the selection of goal-directed event sequences; the ventral part of the mPFC is involved in reward (outcome) processing <xref rid="pone.0093771-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Buckner1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The most rostral part of the mPFC allows the integration of information from the dorsal goal pathway with information from the ventral outcome pathway <xref rid="pone.0093771-Krueger1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, activation of the rostral mPFC may represent personal goal attainment. The emotional stimuli of the present PET study were the participant's personal favorite actresses (self-referential positive stimuli), suggesting that looking at their favorite persons may be linked to personal goal attainment. Thus, activation of the mPFC by looking at their favorite persons represents positive emotion evocation. In fact, our previous PET study indicated that the degree of mPFC activation is positively correlated with positive mood rating scores <xref rid="pone.0093771-Matsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, the present PET study indicated that, compared to the TT carriers, positive emotion-related brain region was activated to a greater extent in the C allele carriers when they watched the positive film, although there were fewer participants in the present study (i.e., 20 participants) compared to the current standards of neuroimaging studies. Considering all the information, compared to the TT carriers, the C allele carriers exhibited a higher sensitivity to positive emotional stimuli. This is consistent with our a priori hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Hedonic brain circuit and the endocannabinoid system</title><p>Berridge and Kringelbach <xref rid="pone.0093771-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> previously discussed the interaction between the endocannabinoid system and pleasure generators in the brain (hedonic hotspots), such as the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. In rodent studies, the nucleus accumbens can be activated by microinjection of the endocannabinoid (anandamide); anandamide microinjections into the nucleus accumbens doubled the number of positive &#x0201c;liking&#x0201d; reactions elicited by intraoral sucrose <xref rid="pone.0093771-Mahler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In humans, a previous study indicated that the activity of the globus pallidus in C allele carriers of <italic>CNR1</italic> was higher than that in TT carriers when happy faces were presented <xref rid="pone.0093771-Chakrabarti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, the endocannabinoid system may positively modulate the sensitivity to positive emotional stimuli through the modulation of hedonic brain hotspot functions. Although we did not focus on the activation of the striatum in the present PET study, several neuroimaging studies have shown that activity in the mPFC correlates with the activity in the striatum <xref rid="pone.0093771-Carlson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-vandenBos1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that higher activation of the striatum or strong connectivity between the striatum and the mPFC in the C allele carriers is observed by using the present psychological task. To test this hypothesis, we will have to conduct a further neuroimaging study in future.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Happiness and the endocannabinoid system</title><p>According to the psychological bottom-up model of subjective well-being, hedonic experiences in each life domain had a positive influence on subjective happiness level <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, the sum of positive life events may be important for constructing subjective happiness level. Because C allele carriers of <italic>CNR1</italic> have a high sensitivity to positive emotional events, positive life events may be more abundant in C allele carriers than TT carriers. Therefore, it is possible that the <italic>CNR1</italic> genotype is associated with subjective happiness level by means of abundant positive life events. In contrast, the top-down model of subjective well-being assumes that individuals with a positive propensity may evaluate their subjective happiness level and daily life events more positively than others who experience a similar number of positive life events <xref rid="pone.0093771-Stones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093771-Schimmack1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, the association between trait optimism and <italic>CNR1</italic> has not yet been examined; however, it is possible that our genetic traits are associated with our personality traits. In fact, a previous neuroimaging study demonstrated that the degree of trait optimism was positively correlated with the response of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) to positive stimuli <xref rid="pone.0093771-Sharot1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Although the rACC is anatomically divided from the mPFC by the cingulate sulcus, these prefrontal cortices are interrelated through the cingulate fasciculus <xref rid="pone.0093771-Etkin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093771-Petrides1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.
