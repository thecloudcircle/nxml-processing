Mechanisms determining altered isoform expression include somatic mutations in splice regulatory sites or altered splicing factors. However, since DNA methylation is known to regulate transcriptional isoform activity in normal cells, we predicted the highly dysregulated patterns of DNA methylation present in cancer also affect isoform activity. We analyzed DNA methylation and RNA-seq isoform data from 18 human cancer types and found frequent correlations specifically within 11 cancer types. Examining the top 25% of variable methylation sites revealed that the location of the methylated CpG site in a gene determined which isoform was used. In addition, the correlated methylation-isoform patterns classified tumors into known subtypes and predicted distinct protein functions between tumor subtypes. Finally, methylation-correlated isoforms were enriched for oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and cancer-related pathways. These findings provide new insights into the functional impact of dysregulated DNA methylation in cancer and highlight the relationship between the epigenome and transcriptome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>In eukaryotes, one gene can be transcribed into multiple RNA sequences (or isoforms) that are subsequently translated into proteins with different functions in response to specific cellular needs. Recent studies showed that cancer cells can obtain abnormal functions via expressing different isoforms. In normal cells, isoform expression can be regulated by DNA methylation&#x02013;a molecular signature with attached methyl groups on DNA sequences. Given that dysregulation of DNA methylation is a cancer hallmark, we suspect the same regulation holds in cancer and contributes to cancer progression. In this study, we analyzed data from 18 human cancer types and found frequent correlations in 11 cancer types between specific isoform usage and DNA methylation depending on the location of the methylated site in a gene. These correlation patterns can classify heterogeneous tumors in a cancer type into homogeneous subtypes and are predicted to change protein functions via isoform switching between subtypes. Finally, we found cancer-related genes often harbored more DNA methylation-isoform correlations than genes not implicated in cancer. This finding could help us to better understand the functional impact of DNA methylation alterations via regulation of isoform expression in tumorigenesis and to further improve the cancer treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHG200323-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1065-019X</contrib-id><name><surname>Elnitski</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding provided by the Intramural Program of the National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health (LE).

Utilizing these approaches, gene function can be tailored to fulfill specific cellular requirements, including regulating cell-fate in response to stress [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or nerve cell regeneration after injury [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, isoform switching&#x02013;differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions&#x02013;is also common, and often biased in cancer versus normal cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], where it is predicted to have deleterious consequences such as sustaining cell proliferation, disturbing apoptosis, and enabling cell motility and invasion [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed the presence of isoform switching in tumor cells can predict patient survival, independent of cancer type [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, researchers seeking to learn more about the mechanisms underlying aberrant isoform activity in cancer have primarily focused on mutations in splicing regulatory sites or altered/deregulated splicing factors. This line of study has been fruitful [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, we now know that mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <italic>BRCA1</italic> cause inappropriate exon skipping and inactivation of <italic>BRCA1</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], whereas upregulation of <italic>NUMA1</italic> splice isoforms in breast cancer cause increased cell proliferation [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the effect of highly dysregulated DNA methylation (DNAm), a distinguishing feature of cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], on isoform usage in tumorigenesis has not been fully investigated.</p><p>We now know that the methylation of intragenic CpG dinucleotides is known as an important regulatory mechanism for isoform switching in normal cells at promoters, internal splicing sites and transcription termination sites. For example, CpG island (CGI) methylation can regulate the activity of internal promoters to provide tissue-specific activity, as evidenced by differential isoform expression of <italic>SHANK3</italic> in distinct brain regions from a single cell type [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, intragenic DNAm within exons or near exon boundaries can regulate alternative splicing outcomes by (1) preventing access of the DNA-binding protein CTCF, whose presence mediates local RNA polymerase II pausing for inclusion of weak exons or (2) facilitating access of the DNA-binding protein MeCP2, involved in inclusion of alternatively spliced exons [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Affecting differential use of transcription termination sites, CGI methylation directs imprinting of murine <italic>H13</italic> isoforms between paternal and maternal alleles [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, DNAm also plays a more generalized repressive role by preventing spurious intragenic PolII initiation to ensure transcriptional fidelity throughout gene bodies [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite abundant evidence that DNAm can regulate isoform switching, research on whether this phenomenon might drive tumorigenesis has been limited, with past studies focusing on alternative transcription start site utilization in prostate cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or isoform switching among single genes in individual cancer types [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, recent advances in transcriptome sequencing and DNAm analysis, coupled with expansive collections of tumor samples, enabled us to test the hypothesis that DNAm dysregulation in cancers can disrupt isoform usage and contribute to tumorigenesis, as a common phenomenon. Further, we investigated whether correlated DNAm and isoform disruption explains differences in tumors from the same organ. Based on a comprehensive analysis of data for 18 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we report that, within 11 cancer types, DNAm in the top 25% of variable methylated sites is associated with isoform switching, and this isoform switching is predicted to have functional consequences for tumorigenesis, involving 10&#x02013;21% of genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Correlation between intragenic DNAm and isoform usage in cancer</title><p>To investigate the regulatory role of DNAm in isoform production, we first calculated Pearson correlations between intragenic DNAm and isoform usage (defined here as the proportion of a given isoform&#x02019;s expression over the expression of all isoforms for a gene). We did this for every isoform-methylation probe pair among tumor samples, for all 18 TCGA cancer datasets used in the study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Methods</xref>). A positive correlation indicates that isoform usage increases as DNAm increases, whereas a negative correlation indicates the opposite. We found significant correlations for at least one isoform-methylation probe pair [empirical false discovery rate (eFDR) &#x0003c; 0.1] in 16 out of 18 cancer types examined. Whether or not a cancer type met the significance threshold was mainly governed by sample size: those with fewer tumor samples required higher correlation coefficients, and two were not able to reach the designated eFDR level at all (colon and glioblastoma). The minimal correlation coefficients (measured as absolute values) required to pass the eFDR cutoff ranged from 0.65 in rectum adenocarcinoma ('READ', 33 samples) to 0.16 in breast invasive carcinoma ('BRCA', 268 samples) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007095.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, the significant correlations remained across multiple cancer types using Spearman correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007095.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), as well as data with batch effects removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007095.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) suggesting the observed significance was not affected by batch effects and outliers when using Pearson correlation.</p><p>To further investigate the connection between DNAm and isoform usage, for each cancer type we identified methylation probes with the most variable values, which were most likely to behave differently across samples (i.e., those whose standard deviation across tumors fell within the top 25% for all sites). From these highly variable methylation sites, we required an absolute correlation between DNAm and isoform usage &#x0003e; 0.3. To guarantee all of these pairs are significantly correlated, we excluded seven cancer types whose absolute correlation was above 0.3 at FDR = 0.1. Although this cutoff value lowered the number of cancer types, it yielded a substantial number of correlated isoform-probe pairs for downstream analyses in each of the 11 remaining cancer types (see 11 cancer types and their abbreviations in <xref rid="pcbi.1007095.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Depending on the cancer type, we identified significantly correlated isoform-probe pairs from 10% (n = 1,428 in thyroid carcinoma, or 'THCA') to 21% (n = 3,121 in bladder urothelial carcinoma, or 'BLCA') of genes analyzed. We hypothesized that, using this dataset, we could determine whether the location of DNAm in an isoform affects its usage; thus, these data form the basis for the analyses that follow.</p><table-wrap

To further investigate rules governing DNAm and TSS usage, we investigated all DNAm probe sites that fell within isoforms' first exons and flanking regions (including 2-kb upstream noncoding regions and 2-kb downstream intronic regions).

This suggests that DNAm in isoform bodies plays a role in transcriptional elongation. To take a closer look, we confined our analysis to methylation probes around isoforms' middle exons, defined as exons that were neither the first exons (i.e., those containing TSSs) nor the terminal exons (i.e., those containing TTSs). Around the second exon, we unexpectedly found enrichment of negative, rather than positive correlations between DNAm and isoform usage extending from 300 bp to 1 kb upstream (#gene = 84) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We reasoned this enrichment could be due to repression of transcription at the first exon, given that the median distance between first and second exons was minimal (i.e., 266 to 795 bps depending on cancer type).

(C) In bladder cancer (BLCA), DNAm within the exon and far from either exon boundary (&#x0003e;1kb) in <italic>BHLHE41</italic> is correlated with the inclusion of the long terminal exon, resulting in increased usage of the longer isoform but decreased usage of the shorter one.

When we pooled all terminal exons regardless of their positions within the isoform (2<sup>nd</sup> + 3<sup>rd</sup> + 4<sup>th</sup> + later; #gene = 125), we found evidence for slightly more positive correlations and enrichment remained for all cancer types. The signal was strongest when we focused on those DNAm probes whose distance to either boundary of the terminal exon was &#x0003e;1kb (#gene = 20), indicating exon length greater than 2 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Furthermore, these positively correlated methylation probes were enriched in CGIs (#gene = 6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007095.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that DNAm in terminal exons may be a signal for terminal exon inclusion, where the signal intensifies at long exons with CGI methylation.</p><p>We also examined DNAm existing outside the terminal exons and asked whether correlations gave insight to TTS use. We found more positive DNAm correlations than negative correlations, up to 1 kb downstream of the terminal exon but not beyond this distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that DNAm in distal downstream locations of a gene may correspond to usage of a latter TTS rather than a former TTS when alternative TTSs are present. Across all 11 cancer types, we collected 10,467 examples of DNAm-correlated isoform switching in which methylation at a single DNAm probe was positively correlated with use of one isoform of a gene but negatively correlated with use of another (this number excluded examples of DNAm-correlated alternative TSSs). Of these, we assessed the distance from the DNAm site to the correlated terminal exon and identified 5,707 instances in which the DNAm probe was located 1 kb beyond the preceding terminal exon boundary. In 70% of those cases (3,977/5,707), the DNAm site was negatively correlated with the use of the preceding TTS, but positively correlated with use of the more downstream TTS. These data support a hypothesis that in cases of isoform switching, DNAm more than 1 kb beyond a terminal exon can be a marker for use of an alternative, more distal TTSs.</p><p>Our findings are illustrated by two (DNAm-correlated) isoform switches we detected in tumor suppressor genes: <italic>BLHLE41</italic> (in BLCA) and <italic>ITGB3</italic> (in skin cutaneous melanoma, or 'SKCM'). In both cases, the DNAm corresponded to RNA isoform output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). For example, the very long terminal exon in <italic>BHLHE41</italic> contains two internal methylation sites positively correlated with the inclusion of a long terminal exon but negatively correlated with the shorter isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The shorter isoform is noncoding and lacks the helix-loop-helix and 'hairy_orange' domains, known for DNA binding and interaction with repressive chromatin modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007095.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>ITGB3</italic>, methylation of a site located &#x0003e;1 kb beyond the terminal exon of the shorter isoform positively correlates with use of the longer isoform and alternative TTS but negatively correlates with the shorter isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Here, both isoforms produce coding transcripts, but the shorter one lacks EGF_2 domains and integrin tail and cytoplasmic domains, necessary for activation of Src tyrosine kinase signaling used in cell movement and proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007095.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Of note, we identified DNAm at five sites near the TSSs also positively correlated with the longer isoform, but negatively correlated with the shorter one, suggestive of additional epigenetic relationships in isoform regulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Correlated DNAm and isoform usage can be used to classify tumors into known subtypes</title><p>In previous studies, DNAm patterns have been used to classify tumors into known or novel subtypes, with the goal of reducing heterogeneity and gaining insight into molecular similarities via unsupervised hierarchical clustering.

For example, in BLCA, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and SKCM, clusters displayed distinct DNAm and isoform usage patterns consistent with many subtypes predefined in TCGA analyses. This suggests that DNA methylation and related isoform usage are tightly coordinated in many cancer subtypes. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), although DNAm clusters were significantly associated with their correlated isoform usage patterns, DNAm clusters were stronger visually, suggesting that the expression changes are small in magnitude.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Functional implications of DNAm-correlated isoform switching in cancer</title><p>To determine whether these subtype-discerning, isoform switching-linked DNAm alterations could impact tumorigenesis, we analyzed the functional outcomes of isoform switching among BRCA subtype samples, and also in normal breast tissue samples, using software designed for this purpose, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

For each comparison except luminal A vs luminal B, we found more than 20 genes affected by one or more type of predicted functional change. Most functional changes involved a protein domain gain or loss, a switch from a coding isoform to a noncoding isoform or vice versa, or extension or shortening of an open reading frame.

We found clustering of numerous genes with PH or RhoGEF domains that were assigned to GTPase/Ras signal transduction, and a number of distinct genes with SH3 domains, which were assigned to developmental biology and cancer pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Thus, alteration of the DNAm of these genes may correspond to alteration of their functional domains and influence pathway functions in many types of cancer.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007095.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007095.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Genes exhibiting DNAm-correlated isoform usage in multiple cancer types show pathway and functional relationships.</title><p>Red squares indicate involvement in 21 pathways/gene sets (<italic>rows</italic>) for 60 genes with DNAm-correlated isoform usage (<italic>columns</italic>).

Within cancer types, DNAm correlated to isoform usage patterns can be used to classify tumors into known histopathological subtypes, implicating distinctive protein alterations in functional differences among tumors. Furthermore, we show that DNAm-correlated isoform usage is enriched in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as pathways pertinent to tumorigenesis, such as cell adhesion and signaling. Thus, this study shows that DNAm-correlated isoform usage alterations are common, could functionally contribute to cancer processes, and represent a new paradigm in the cancer epigenomic landscape.</p><p>Although this study focused on DNAm-linked isoform switching in cancer, some of the trends we identified are consistent with previous findings in normal cells. For example, we found DNAm near the 5&#x02019; end of a gene was primarily negatively correlated with the use of nearby TSSs, which is consistent with its previously documented repression of promoter activity [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We also noted that a few TSS showed positive correlations with methylation, which we predict this may occur when repression of one weakly defined TSS enables activation of another in close proximity. Such examples of proximal TSSs are strongly associated with CpG islands [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, our findings shed light on a subject of debate in the literature regarding the role of intragenic DNAm in transcript elongation [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] vs wholesale transcriptional repression [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Except for regions around first exons, we found primarily positive correlations between gene body DNAm and isoform usage, supporting a role of DNAm in transcriptional elongation.</p><p>Some trends identified in this study have not been previously reported in normal cells&#x02014;or in any study of DNAm and isoform switching. For example, we showed that DNAm that is negatively correlated with nearby TSSs shows enrichment for OSRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007095.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition, our data suggest that exonic DNAm occurring far from exon boundaries in alternative terminal exons, may promote the inclusion of those exons. These correlations suggest a potential blueprint for DNAm-regulated isoform activities worthy of further experimental elucidation while controlling for other isoform-regulating mechanisms such as aforementioned splicing factor alterations and recently reported regulation via miRNA binding at 3&#x02019;UTRs [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In the past, the connection between DNAm and dysregulated isoform usage in cancer has been overlooked for two main reasons. First, the main functional role established for cancer-associated DNAm alterations is gene silencing via promoter CGI methylation. Thus, most cancer studies have focused on causal relationships between aberrant promoter hypermethylation and tumor suppressor gene silencing [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], paying less attention to the functional consequences of intragenic DNAm alterations. Second, the impact of DNAm alterations on the transcriptome is mostly studied at the gene rather than the isoform level. For example, to detect promoter DNAm-induced gene silencing and to study the impact of intragenic DNAm on gene transcription, gene-level expression data are used [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, tumor samples with similar gene expression levels can display significant differences in isoform usage [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our findings emphasize the need to conduct analyses at the isoform level in order to understand the impact of DNAm on the transcriptome.</p><p>Our study has several important limitations. First, the potential regulatory paradigms reported in this study (e.g., DNAm around the TSS is correlated with decreased isoform usage) may vary in a condition-specific manner. Our findings were based on majority rule, but we noted a few exceptions, including positive correlations between DNAm and nearby TSSs at some sites and negative correlations between DNAm and expression of isoform bodies at other sites. Second, our analysis was based on correlations between methylation at individual CpG sites and usage of individual isoforms. Whether (and how) DNAm at CpGs dispersed throughout a locus collectively regulates isoform usage is still unclear. Third, we did not directly investigate the role of DNAm in alternative splicing, although such alterations have been shown to contribute to cancer progression [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and can be modulated by interactions between DNAm and proteins such as CTCF [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], MeCP2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and HP1 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Integrative analysis of these factors (using ChIP-Seq datasets, for example) coupled with exon-level expression data may provide insights into a mechanistic link between DNAm alterations and deleterious alternative splicing in cancer. Fourth, our analysis relied on Ensembl gene annotation. Thus, we may have missed links between DNAm and aberrantly expressed isoforms in cancer that have not yet been annotated. Finally, DNAm detected in this study could not distinguish its most abundant form, 5-mC, from other variants such as 5-hmC, 5-fC, and 5-caC, which might have different roles in isoform regulation.</p><p>In conclusion, this comprehensive analysis highlights the potential functional role of DNAm in dysregulating isoform usage in cancer. These findings provide new insights into the mechanistic links connecting DNAm and cancer, as well as the rules defining DNAm-isoform interactions. Experimentally validating the rules defining correlated DNAm-isoform expression in the future could give us more comprehensive understanding of cancer biology. Most importantly, given recent advances in targeted DNAm editing [<xref rid="pcbi.1007095.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], if researchers are able to identify DNAm-induced isoform switching that drives cancer progression, the findings could launch a new field focused on epigenetic therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed samples for which both isoform expression data and DNA methylation data were available.
