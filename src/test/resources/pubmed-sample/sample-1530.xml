With a high mutation rate and frequent recombination, enteroviruses are noted to evolve and change over time. Given the evidence that human enteroviruses are commonly found in other mammalian species and that some human and animal enteroviruses are genetically similar, it is possible that enzootic enteroviruses may also be infecting human populations. We conducted a systematic review of the English and Chinese literature published between 2007 and 2017 to examine evidence that enteroviruses may be zoonotic. Of the 2704 articles screened for inclusion, 16 articles were included in the final review. The review of these articles yielded considerable molecular evidence of zooanthroponosis transmission, particularly among non-human primates. While there were more limited instances of anthropozoonosis transmission, the available data support the biological plausibility of cross-species transmission and the need to conduct periodic surveillance at the human&#x02013;animal interface.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Enteroviruses (EVs) are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> that infect millions of people worldwide on an annual basis, especially infants and children under the age of one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. More than 300 serotypes of EV have been identified and demonstrated to cause a variety of diseases and morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Among the most notable EVs known to infect humans are coxsackie-, echo-, polio-, and rhinoviruses. While a majority of non-polio EV infections are asymptomatic or cause mild respiratory disease, more severe disease outcomes such as aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis are associated with certain EV types. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71), for example, is a type most commonly associated with severe hand, foot, and mouth (HFMD) disease. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a type that has caused sporadic but severe respiratory disease outbreaks across the United States, Asia, Africa, and Europe in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In 2012, a comparative analysis of phylogenic and genetic classification demonstrated a close relationship between animal and human picornaviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In February 2013, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) approved changes to EV and rhinovirus species names to remove all reference to the host species names. Former species names had been selected based upon the host species from which the virus was originally isolated; however, after many of the human EV species were identified and isolated in non-human hosts, the proposal was made to drop the designation of the viruses as human, bovine, porcine, and simian. Today, EVs are classified into 12 species, including enterovirus A&#x02013;L (EV-A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, and L) and rhinovirus A&#x02013;C (RV-A, B, and C) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Both reviews followed the standard systematic review procedures established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). In each of these databases, we empirically chose to search for citations during the last 10 years as molecular methods for virus detections have markedly increased during the last decade as compared to older diagnostic methods such as cell culture and immunoassays. The search was additionally limited to include the following publication categories: review, article, dissertation, thesis, or journal.

Interestingly, among these studies, the reverse zoonoses of EVs between NHP populations and humans are discussed most frequently. It also became evident through the review that there have been a number of diverse HEVs identified in NHPs. For instance, the Harvala et al. studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and Sadeuh-Mba et al. studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> detected diverse EV species, such as species A (A76, A89, A90, A119), species B (B110), and species D (D111, D120) through screening of fecal samples collected from wild chimpanzees and gorilla in Central African countries (primarily in Cameroon). These EV types have been also detected in humans or were found to be closely related to previously detected HEV types. Similarly, the Oberste et al. studies conducted in Bangladesh also reported that several types of HEVs (including species A, B, and C) detected from both captive and wild NHPs (primarily Rhesus macaques)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that EV-A76 was detected from both human samples and urban rhesus macaques in Bangladesh as well, although EV-A76 was not the most prevalent picornavirus detected among NHPs in the study. In similar studies conducted in Denmark and the USA, although researchers did not find the same types of HEVs as previously described in the studies conducted in Bangladesh and Central Africa, authors did find several new types of EVs that also closely related to HEVs circulating in rhesus macaques, including Coxsackie B3 (CB3, now assigned into species B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, simian enterovirus 46 (SV46), and EV92<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These results may indicate that NHPs are susceptible to more diverse types of HEVs than previously expected.</p><p id="Par20">In contrast to human infections with HEVs, which have been widely studied in the past decades, NHP infections with HEVs have not historically received as much attention. Based on the evidence from a growing number reported instances of NHP infection with diverse HEVs, as well as several instances of human infection with non-human EVs, there are compelling data to show the possibility for cross-species EV transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. It is, therefore, important to understand the relationship between humans and NHPs and consider the susceptibility of NHPs to HEV infection.</p><p id="Par21">Numerous previous reports mentioned that NHPs shared more than 90% of human DNA. Among these NHPs, chimpanzees (&#x0003e;99% with human DNA) were reported to be humans&#x02019; closest living relatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Our findings in this review support the hypothesis that NHPs (especially chimpanzees) may be at an increased risk for infection with human diseases because of their genetic similarity and due to less of a species barrier for pathogen transfer. However, the condition that this phenomenon is hinged on is close contact between NHPs and humans. It is well documented that there has been an increase in contact between NHPs and humans in recent decades, especially in Central African countries and South Asian countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. For instance, Wolfe et al. and Betsem et al. describe how the growing demand for bushmeat and intensified deforestation of tropical forests in Central Africa have escalated humans&#x02019; hunting activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. These hunting practices increase wild NHPs&#x02019; proximity to humans and heighten the risk of human pathogen infections in NHPs. In addition, due to rapid urbanization, an increase in population density and change in land use (i.e. forest encroachment) in recent decades, many South Asian countries (i.e. Singapore, and Bangladesh) have reported the NHPs (e.g. Rhesus macaques and long-tailed macaques) thrive in new human habitats, also thereby increasing the interactions between humans and NHPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">In 2007, Wolfe et al. reported, &#x0201c;primates constitute only 0.5% of all vertebrate species but have contributed about 20% of our major human diseases&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Indeed, there are many human infectious diseases with NHP origins that are well-known and documented, including HIV/AIDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, hepatitis B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Although no studies included in this review demonstrated human infection with an NHP EV, many of them indicate that NHP infection with human EVs might amplify human viruses or even facilitate recombination with primate EVs, yielding a novel source of future emerging diseases in humans. Thus, future studies exploring cross-species transmission of EVs between NHPs and humans are still needed.</p><p id="Par23">The zoonotic transfer of EVs is not, however, limited to NHPs and humans; other animal EVs have also been found to infect humans and diverse animal species, such as BEV and SVDV. Subsequent to the G&#x000fc;r et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> study of BEV-1 antibodies in humans, horses, dogs, goats, and sheep, McClenahan et al. (2013) found that alpacas had been infected with BEVs in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The review also demonstrated the close relationship between SVDV and an HEV-B serotype, coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5), suggesting that SVDV was produced by the recombination between CVB5 and one other EV-B serotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. These findings highlight the potential for cross-species transmission of SVDV. Cross-species transmission of animal EVs may also increase the risk for new emerging infectious diseases, as animal EVs may more easily mutate or recombine with other viruses in an animal host.</p><p id="Par24">This systematic review had a number of limitations. First, as we limited the online review to studies published during the past ten years (focusing upon the more frequent use of molecular methods), the review may have missed some early reports of possible EV zoonoses. For example, we learned of the 1973 report documenting probable SVDV infections among workers at the Animal Virus Research Institute (United Kingdom) through serological assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> through an external reviewer of the manuscript. Similar, non-molecular evidence of zoonoses may have been missed. Second, through our search strategy we focused heavily upon zoonoses, and may have missed some important reports of cross-species infections among nonhuman animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. We cannot exclude the possibility that partial genomes of viruses detected in animal feces were pathogens passing through the digestive system without active infection. Additionally, this review only found limited articles demonstrating evidence of anthropozoonosis&#x000a0; EV infection. Although the findings of these studies demonstrate the potential for animal EVs to infect humans, these results are not generalizable. For example, as a serological study, the G&#x000fc;r et al. study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> cannot provide evidence of active BEV-1 infection. In the other study demonstrating possible evidence of anthropozoonosis&#x000a0;, Grutzmacher et al. found only one human fecal sample testing positive for an animal EV. While our findings demonstrate that EVs may be transmitted from animals to humans, the current scientific data are still somewhat sparse and provide suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence.</p><p id="Par25">However, all of these findings convey an important message: the diversity of EVs and potential for cross-species transmission of EVs between humans and animals should not be underestimated. Further surveillance for cross-species EV infections among both humans and animals seem warranted. By leveraging a One Health approach, veterinarians, epidemiologists, and public health stakeholders will most effectively be able to provide targeted surveillance for EVs circulating in humans and animals. We recognize the barriers to active surveillance for EVs, including access to timely diagnostic tests, cross-reactivity in serology, and the limitations of primer-based molecular assays in detecting human as opposed to new animal EVs. As molecular diagnostic techniques continue to evolve, however, researchers may turn to more sensitive surveillance techniques, such as unbiased next-generation DNA sequencing as a solution to some of these hurdles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par26">This review found considerable molecular evidence supporting the occurrence of zooanthroponoses of EV infection, particularly among NHPs. While it is more limited, serological evidence of BEV-1 in humans and phylogenic evidence of an SVDV-like infection in a human fecal sample, demonstrate the possibility of anthropozoonotic transfer. From a One Health perspective, we must consider that anthropogenic factors such as deforestation combined with an overall global increase in industrialized animal production has led to intensified and more frequent interactions between humans and animals. In particular, should contact between humans and NHPs increase the risk of zoonotic transfer, active surveillance for EV infections will be increasingly important due to deforestation and the resulting trend of escalated interactions between wild primate populations and humans. Given our understanding of the possibility for zoonotic transfer, and the knowledge that zooanthroponotic transfer of EVs may commonly occur, surveillance for cross-species transmission of enteroviruses is recommended, regardless of the directionality of the transfer.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>These authors contributed equally: Jane K.
