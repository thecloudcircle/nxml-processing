Nucleolytic resection commits repair towards homologous recombination, which preferentially occurs between sister chromatids. DSB resection promotes recruitment of the Mec1 checkpoint kinase to the break. Rtt107 is a target of Mec1 and serves as a scaffold during repair. Rtt107 plays an important role during rescue of damaged replication forks, however whether Rtt107 contributes to the repair of DSBs is unknown. Here we show that Rtt107 is recruited to DSBs induced by the HO endonuclease. Rtt107 phosphorylation by Mec1 and its interaction with the Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 complex are both required for Rtt107 loading to breaks, while Rtt107 regulators Slx4 and Rtt101 are not. We demonstrate that Rtt107 has an effect on the efficiency of sister chromatid recombination (SCR) and propose that its recruitment to DSBs, together with the Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 complex is important for repair through the SCR pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by European Research Council ERC starting grant 202337 (LA) and by the Medical Research Council UK (LA).

DSBs trigger a cellular response that involves checkpoint, repair, chromatin and structural proteins many of which are recruited to the site of damage. This response is highly conserved, highlighting the importance of ensuring correct DSB repair to prevent genomic instability.</p><p>Cells can repair DSBs using a variety of pathways, including non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) <xref rid="pone.0020152-Daley1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and homologous recombination (HR) <xref rid="pone.0020152-Paques1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. HR involves the use of similar sequences as a template to repair the break, whereas during NHEJ the broken ends of DNA are directly rejoined. Because of its nature, HR requires an intact donor DNA molecule. Sister-chromatids are the ideal templates to repair DSBs via HR because they contain an exact copy of the broken site. Therefore it is not surprising that DSB repair by sister chromatid recombination (SCR) is the preferred choice in eukaryotic cells during the S and G2/M periods of the cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0020152-Kadyk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Upon DSB induction a response that culminates in the enforcement of cohesion around the break site is triggered, which involves the recruitment of cohesin, the protein complex that maintains sister chromatids paired <xref rid="pone.0020152-Guacci1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Michaelis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> to the DSB <xref rid="pone.0020152-Strom1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Unal1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Increased cohesion between the broken chromatid and the intact one is thought to promote post-replicative DSB repair between them. The Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 complex, related to cohesin, is also recruited to DSB sites <xref rid="pone.0020152-DePiccoli1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Potts1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Lindroos1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> to mediate repair via SCR <xref rid="pone.0020152-DePiccoli1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Potts1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although the exact role of Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 during SCR repair is not well understood, the fact that cohesin loading is altered in the absence of Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 raises the possibility that Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 mediates SCR by promoting cohesin loading to DSB sites.</p><p>In budding yeast, the checkpoint kinases Mec1 (ATM) and Tel1 (ATR) are recruited early to break sites <xref rid="pone.0020152-Lisby1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

H2AX is a Mec1 target, whose phosphorylation is required for cohesin loading <xref rid="pone.0020152-Unal1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Here, we report that the Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 interacting factor Rtt107 is also recruited to DSBs and affects SCR repair. We show that phosphorylation of Rtt107, which depends on Mec1p and Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 is sufficient for its recruitment to HO-induced breaks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rtt107 localises to HO-induced DSBs</title><p>On the basis of the interaction between Rtt107 and the Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 complex <xref rid="pone.0020152-Ohouo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we investigated whether Rtt107 localises to an HO endonuclease catalyzed DSB formed at a unique site in the MAT locus on chromosome III <xref rid="pone.0020152-Strathern1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Transcriptional regulation of the HO endonuclease using the galactose inducible promoter allowed us to control the timing of DSB induction <xref rid="pone.0020152-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. DSBs at the MAT locus are repaired by homologous recombination with HML and HMR loci <xref rid="pone.0020152-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To prevent repair of HO-induced DSBs, both HM loci were deleted in our strains, thus maximising the persistence of the break to facilitate possible detection of Rtt107 at this site.</p><p>Cells were engineered to express an epitope tagged version of Rtt107 (<italic>RTT107-9xMYC</italic>). Chromatin binding of this protein to sites around the DSB were assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We used different primer pairs covering at least 30 kb on either side of the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). DNA sequences were amplified from the input chromatin and chromatin immunoprecipitated to calculate the relative percentage of immunoprecipiated material. To control for DSB-independent effects on protein occupancy we also used a primer pair specific for sequences located in a different chromosome (chromosome VI). First we tested the efficiency of DSB induction and intact DNA damage checkpoint activation. We used the checkpoint protein Ddc2 fused to GFP as an <italic>in vivo</italic> marker of DSB formation in our strains <xref rid="pone.0020152-Melo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Two hours after galactose-mediated HO induction &#x0223c;80% of the cells arrested as dumbbells with a single Ddc2 focus (data not shown) demonstrating that the HO break at the MAT locus is efficiently induced and not repaired, thus causing G2/M arrest in our experimental system.</p><fig id="pone-0020152-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0020152.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Rtt107 is enriched on regions flanking the HO-induced DSB.</title><p>(A) A DSB was induced at the MAT locus in strains expressing Rtt107-9myc.

Cells were then split and one half transferred to galactose (cut), while the other half were grown in the absence of galactose (uncut). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed around the HO cleavage site in the MAT locus of chromosome III. The binding of Rtt107 around the locus was evaluated 2 and 4 hours post-induction (2 hrs, 4 hrs) or in the absence of the DSB (uncut). Input DNA and DNA immunoprecipitated were amplified with primers at the indicated distances from the HO site. The average of two independent experiments with the corresponding standard deviation is shown. A locus on chromosome VI was used as a control.

In the absence of a DSB, we found low Rtt107 binding across the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;B</xref>; uncut). After 2 hours of HO induction, we detected a general increase in binding around the regions flanking the break (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>; 2 hrs). The maximum DSB-induced increase was &#x0223c;7-fold and localised to regions 0.5&#x02013;10 kb away from the DNA break on either side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;B</xref>; 2&#x02013;4 hrs). The relative binding decreased with distances greater than 20 kb from the break, however the regions immediately adjacent to the DSB site were found to be also high in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;B</xref>; 2&#x02013;4 hrs). Thus the presence of a DSB induces a significant increase in Rtt107 binding in a domain around the DSB.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 complex contribute to Rtt107 phosphorylation</title><p>Rtt107 is extensively phosphorylated by Mec1 in response to DNA damage <xref rid="pone.0020152-Rouse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Consistent with this, we found that exposure to MMS, hydroxyurea, camptothecin (CPT) or an HO-induced DSB in wildtype cells expressing <italic>RTT107-9MYC</italic> led to substantial mobility changes of Rtt107 on SDS-PAGE gels. The mobility change was reversed by treatment of the extracts with &#x003bb;-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020152.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Previous studies of Rtt107 phosphorylation used western blot analysis with antibodies reported to recognise phosphorylated SQ/TQ motifs, which are sites of Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0020152-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We have been able to resolve Rtt107 phosphorylation through changes in protein mobility on SDS-PAGE gels using a 30&#x02236;1 ratio of acrylamide:bisacrylamide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020152.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We therefore tested whether in addition to Mec1 other factors contribute to Rtt107 phosphorylation. Rtt107 was tagged in different checkpoint kinase mutant backgrounds, including the effector kinases Rad53 and Chk1 and the adaptor kinases Rad9 and Mrc1, and cells were exposed to different genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that none of these kinases contributes to Rtt107 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In fission yeast, the Rtt107 homologue Brc1 was identified as a multi-copy suppressor of the UV hypersensitivity associated with loss of Rad18 <xref rid="pone.0020152-Verkade1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the homologue of Smc6. Recently, a physical interaction between budding yeast Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 complex and Rtt107 was described <xref rid="pone.0020152-Ohouo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 function contributes to Rtt107 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage.

In contrast, we observed Rtt107 phosphorylation only in wildtype cells under non-permissive temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020152-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

DSBs are one of the most serious lesions in DNA and can be lethal if not repaired or can generate deleterious effects to the genome if repaired improperly. Therefore, accurate mechanisms for DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) are important for all living organisms. Repair generally occurs in a stepwise manner and begins with the recruitment of different factors to the break site to orchestrate a coordinated response that involves signalling and repair activities. It is therefore important to understand the order of events at DSBs as well as the dependencies between the factors that are recruited.</p><p>The checkpoint kinase Mec1 is recruited to break sites early during the repair response <xref rid="pone.0020152-Lisby1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Mec1 phosphorylation then acts on a variety of proteins at the site <xref rid="pone.0020152-Rouse1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. One of Mec1 targets is the Rtt107 scaffold protein <xref rid="pone.0020152-Rouse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, however, prior to this study Mec1-dependent phosphoylation of Rtt107 had only been studied in the context of damaged replication forks <xref rid="pone.0020152-Rouse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Previous investigation of Rtt107 homologues in fission yeast <xref rid="pone.0020152-Verkade1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and mammalian cells, raised a possible function for Rtt107 at DSBs; PTIP (mammalian Rtt107 homologue) is indeed recruited to DNA damage sites formed by ionizing radiation <xref rid="pone.0020152-Manke1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Here, we have investigated the role of Rtt107, and its phosphorylation, at DNA double-stranded breaks. We observed that following the induction of an irreparable break by the HO endonuclease, Rtt107 is recruited to regions surrounding the break. We demonstrated that the Mec1 kinase is required for both Rtt107 phosphorylation in response to a single DSB as well as its recruitment, as both events are absent in <italic>mec1&#x00394;</italic> mutants. This result indicates that the recruitment of Rtt107 to DSBs is controlled by Mec1 phosphorylation. We confirmed this hypothesis showing that the phospho-mutant allele of Rtt107 (Rtt107-AQ) is unable to be recruited to breaks in the presence of Mec1 while a phospho-mimicking allele (Rtt107-DQ) is indeed recruited even when Mec1 is non-functional. The dependency of Rtt107 recruitment to DSB on phosphorylation by the Mec1 kinase is in contrast to Rtt107 recruitment to stalled forks, which is independent of Mec1 <xref rid="pone.0020152-Roberts2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and thus phosphorylation.</p><p>A number of protein interactions have been described for Rtt107 <xref rid="pone.0020152-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Chin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Roberts2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0020152-Ohouo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

We found that recruitment was drastically reduced in the <italic>smc6</italic>&#x02013;<italic>9</italic> mutant allele, suggesting that intact Smc5&#x02013;Smc6 function is a requirement for Rtt107 DSB-loading. Furthermore, we observed that Rtt107 phosphorylation is impaired in <italic>smc6</italic>&#x02013;<italic>9</italic> mutants, confirming that Rtt107 phosphorylation is important for recruitment.

Interestingly, Slx4 is also not essential for Rtt107 binding to stalled replication forks <xref rid="pone.0020152-Roberts2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

To detect Rtt107 phosphorylation for the various experiments, liquid cultures were grown overnight to a final concentration of 0.7&#x0003c;OD<sub>595</sub>&#x0003c;0.4 and were then incubated in the presence of different DNA damage agents; methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), camptothecin (CPT) or hydroxyurea (HU) and grown for 2 hours more before processing. Final concentration of MMS was 0.03%, final concentration of CPT was 5 &#x000b5;g/ml and the final concentration of HU was 50 &#x000b5;M. The drugs were added to the cultures as in <xref rid="pone.0020152-Rouse2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Cultures growing in liquid media were incubated at 25&#x000b0;C, 30&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C in flasks (the volume of the flask was 5 times the volume of the culture), shaken at high speed [250 rotations per minute (rpm) in a New Brunswick G25 shaking incubator (GMI Inc.), with 4 cm rotation diameter, or at 150 rpm in a SM1003 shaking incubator (Kuhner), with 44 cm rotation diameter].

Gels were run at 100 V in Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer (National Diagnostics) and were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences) in a Biorad blotting system in Tris- glycine transfer buffer (National Diagnostics) containing 20% methanol. Transfer was for 1.5 hours at 285 mA or overnight at 30 V. Membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for at least 30 minutes, then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc IgG1 antibody 9E10 (Roche), at a 1/5000 dilution (from stock 5 mg/ml) in blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in 2.5% milk powder in PBST. Following several washes in PBST, membranes were incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG Horseradish-Peroxidase-linked antibody (GE Healthcare) at 1/10000 in 2.5% skimmed milk powder in PBST. After several further washes in PBST, the ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) was used to detect the secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted as in <xref rid="pone.0020152-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Primers sites used were as in <xref rid="pone.0020152-DePiccoli1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Real-time PCR was used to quantify enrichment. PCR reactions were performed using the SensiMix NoRef Kit (Quatance). Reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions in a total volume of 20 &#x000b5;l, containing 1 &#x000b5;l of immunoprecipitated or input DNA and 1.5 &#x000b5;l of 10 &#x000b5;M oligonucleotide primer pairs. Reactions were amplified using a DNA Engine Opticon2 thermal cycler and were analysed using Opticon software (MJ Research). Each PCR reaction was reproduced in duplicate: reactions in which the difference between the two duplicates was bigger than 0.5 cycles were not considered. PCR amplifications were analysed for the melting curve profile to confirm the absence of contaminant PCR products. Mean &#x0201c;threshold cycle number&#x0201d; (or Ct value) was calculated for each PCR, selected in the window of exponential amplification phase. Enrichment was calculated using the following formula: enrichment&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2(Ct IP DNA &#x02013; Ct input DNA), where Ct IP is the Ct value for the immunoprecipitated sample, and Ct input is the Ct value for the input DNA. The specificity of the enrichment was tested by comparing the values from tagged and untagged strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Recombination assays for sister chromatid exchanges</title><p>The sister chromatid exchange used has been described before <xref rid="pone.0020152-Mozlin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In brief, yeast strains were grown on YPD plates for 2&#x02013;3 days at 30&#x000b0;C. 5 independent colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of YPD, and cultures were grown overnight at 30&#x000b0;C. For the Rtt107 phosphorylation mutants, strains were grown on YPD plates for 2&#x02013;3 days at 30&#x000b0;C. Colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of YPD, and cultures were grown overnight at 30&#x000b0;C. Cells were then washed and transferred to medium containing galactose, and the constructs were expressed for 2 hours, before washing and aliquoting into dilutions. Cells were then plated on SC medium, and SC medium minus adenine and tryptophan supplemented with galactose. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water. Aliquots of appropriate dilutions were plated onto SC medium to determine the number of viable cells in each culture and onto SC medium minus adenine and tryptophan for the recombination assay, to determine the total number of recombinants in each culture. Plates were incubated for 3&#x02013;5 days, after which the colonies were counted. For each strain, recombination rates were measured three times on independent isolates and the mean values are shown.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0020152.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
