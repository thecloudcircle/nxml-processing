The mechanisms of action of NVP-BKM120 in colon cancer cells are unclear. In the present study, we investigated how NVP-BKM120 suppresses colon cancer cells growth and potentiates effects of other chemotherapeutic drugs. We found that NVP-BKM120 treatment enhance PUMA induction irrespective of p53 status through the FoxO3a pathway following AKT inhibition. Furthermore, PUMA is required for NVP-BKM120-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells. In addition, NVP-BKM120 also synergized with 5-Fluorouracil or regorafenib to induce marked apoptosis via PUMA induction. Deficiency of PUMA suppressed apoptosis and antitumor effect of NVP-BKM120 in xenograft model. These results demonstrate a key role of PUMA in mediating the anticancer effects of NVP-BKM120 and suggest that PUMA could be used as an indicator of NVP-BKM120 sensitivity, and also have important implications for it clinical applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NVP-BKM120</kwd><kwd>PUMA</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>FoxO3a</kwd><kwd>colon cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are belong to a family of enzymes, which are response to growth, cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, DNA repair, motility, differentiation and survival [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In cell signaling pathway, PI3Ks function as intermediate signaling molecules including PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NVP-BKM120 (Buparlisib) is a small molecule orally-available compound, which has potent pan-class I PI3K inhibitory capability against the p110&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;/&#x003b3; catalytic subunit isoforms [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previously studies demonstrated that NVP-BKM120 exerts anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects on solid tumor and hematological malignancies via selective AKT inhibition [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several recent reports also demonstrated that NVP-BKM120 combine with other signaling pathways inhibitors promote its antitumor effects in mouse models [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>P53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA, also known as BBC3) belongs to proapototic protein, member of BH3-only Bcl-2 protein family. In cancer cells, PUMA play a key role in apoptosis regulation [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PUMA can be induced by p53 -dependent and -independent manner. In p53-dependent transcription manner, DNA damage agents, such as common chemotherapeutic drugs, &#x003b3;-irradiation, activate p53 and initiate apoptosis through PUMA induction [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, PUMA induction via p53-independent manner is modulated by the transcription factor such as p73, FoxO3a, E2F1, STAT1, or NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PUMA induction potently promotes apoptosis in cancer cells by binding to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL), which activates the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bax and Bak), resulting in dysfunction of mitochondrial leading to caspase cascade activity [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, our results indicate that NVP-BKM120-induced PUMA induction through the AKT/FoxO3a pathway, and PUMA plays a key role in therapeutic response to NVP-BKM120 in CRC. Our results suggest that PUMA induction is indicative of the therapeutic efficacy of NVP-BKM120.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>NVP-BKM120 induces apoptosis in CRC</title><p>To investigate the effective of NVP-BKM120 on CRC, six colon cancer cells were treated with different doses of NVP-BKM120 for 72 hours.

We exclude p73 and E2F1 due to lack of induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Interestingly, NVP-BKM120 treatment markedly dephosphorylation AKT at S473, also reduced FoxO3a phosphorylation, which is known to prevent its nuclear translocation and ensuing transactivation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

While the mechanism by which the chemo-sensitization effects of NVP-BKM120 is not well understood. From the above results, we reasoned that the chemo-sensitization effects of NVP-BKM120 were mediated by PUMA induction, due to concurrent PUMA induction following NVP-BKM120 and other agent treatment through different pathways. Importantly, we found that higher levels of PUMA was stimulated by NVP-BKM120 combined with 5-FU, compared to single agent alone treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The result is consistent with parallel PUMA induction via <italic>p53</italic>-dependent and -independent mechanism by DNA damage and NVP-BKM120. Following the combination treatment, the apoptosis level and caspase 3 and 9 activation were markedly increased in parental cells, in contrary to <italic>PUMA</italic>-KD HCT116 and DLD1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A-5D</xref>).

ALL four isoforms of Class I PI3K (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, and &#x003b4;) are selectively targeted by this oral PI3K inhibitor [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. NVP-BKM120 has demonstrated proapoptotic, anti-proliferative, and anticancer effects in a variety of cell lines and animal models through cancers-dependent and -independent aberrant PI3K pathway activation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the current study, we examined the effect of NVP-BKM120 on CRC. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the tumor suppression by NVP-BKM120 is at least in part mediated by the cell autonomous process of apoptosis induction, progressing from AKT inhibition, FoxO3a activation, leading to PUMA induction and onset of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.</p><p>PUMA induction in response to p53 and/or other apoptotic signals, which are associated with mitochondria and induce cell death when overexpressed in different kinds of cell lines, and the activity of apoptotic requires an complete BH3 domain [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. PUMA has been shown involved in the critical process of tumorgenesis [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previously study indicated that PUMA should be a potential chemotherapeutic target because activated PUMA inhibits tumor growth by restoring cell apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, PUMA can also be stimulated via a p53-independent way. In non-inflammatory toxin-stimulated conditions such as inflammatory cytokines, deprivation of growth factory and p53-independent PUMA induction can be mediated by various transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B, E2F1, FoxO3a, and p73 [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. PUMA induction strongly promoted cancer cell apoptosis by acting on other Bcl-2 family members, and triggered caspase cascade [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These findings suggest that antitumor effect of NVP-BKM120 via p53-independent PUMA induction.</p><p>The current study indicates that PUMA-induced by NVP-BKM120 initiates apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in CRC. Several reports showed that PUMA induction plays a key role in apoptosis induction in response to numbers of chemotherapeutic agents, and is likely to be a useful biomarker of chemo-sensitivity [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The results demonstrate that the induction of PUMA can be used as a biomarker for predicting response of CRC to NVP-BKM120.</p><p>In summary, our results revealed a novel anticancer mechanism of NVP-BKM120 via PUMA-mediated apoptosis. AKT/FoxO3a signaling pathway was involved in NVP-BKM120-induced PUMA expression. Our results indicated PUMA induction can be used as a biomarker for clinical trials testing NVP-BKM120, and can help important implications for the future development and application.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>The human colon cancer cell lines including HCT116, DLD1, HT29, Lim2405, SW480 and LoVo were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
