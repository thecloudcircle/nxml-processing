So far, the mitochondrial genomes of two cone snail species (<italic>Conus textile</italic> and <italic>Conus borgesi</italic>) have been described, and these feed on snails and worms, respectively. Here, we report the mitochondrial genome sequence of the fish-hunting cone snail <italic>Conus consors</italic> and describe a novel putative control region (CR) which seems to be absent in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of other cone snail species. This possible CR spans about 700 base pairs (bp) and is located between the genes encoding the transfer RNA for phenylalanine (tRNA-Phe, <italic>trnF</italic>) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (<italic>cox3</italic>). The novel putative CR contains several sequence motifs that suggest a role in mitochondrial replication and transcription.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study has been performed as part of the CONCO cone snail genome project for health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.conco.eu">www.conco.eu</ext-link>) funded by the European Commission within the 6th Framework Program (LIFESCIHEALTH-6 Integrated Project LSHB-CT-2007, contract number 037592) with Dr Torbj&#x000f6;rn Ingemansson as scientific officer.

All necessary permits were obtained for the described field studies from the Official Authorities of New Caledonia. The cone snails were kept in aquariums in the frame of the CONCO project. The foot tissue samples from one specimen of <italic>Conus consors</italic> (sample NC070619AB) were prepared early 2008. Several steps were optimized in order to produce the most DNA of acceptable molecular weight (greater than 10 Kbp dsDNA) per mg of tissue <xref rid="pone.0051528-Stockwell1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. For Roche/454 sequencing, <italic>Conus consors</italic> genomic DNA (gDNA) was initially isolated using the following steps. DNA extraction was achieved using the EDTA/EGTA/SDS/Proteinase K protocol developed at the J. Craig Venter Institute, which is a modification of standard techniques <xref rid="pone.0051528-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. 149.8 mg of <italic>Conus consors</italic> foot tissue was ground to powder using mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. The pulverized tissue was resuspended in TE/EGTA buffer and cells were lysed by three repeated freeze/thaw cycles, and treated with lysozyme and proteinase K. DNA was extracted with buffer saturated phenol, which was followed by overnight precipitation in 4&#x000b0;C ethanol. DNA extraction was achieved with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer to remove phenolics, polysaccharides, and other PCR inhibitors. The CTAB interface was back-extracted with chloroform to recover additional gDNA, which was followed by phenol, phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation and DNA resuspension. It was noted that even after multiple rounds of extraction/precipitation, the <italic>C. consors</italic> DNA exhibited an unusual brown-purple pigment and a relatively high viscosity. For Illumina/Solex sequencing an improved protocol was established for isolating <italic>Conus consors</italic> genomic DNA that was free of any pigments and exhibited a typical viscosity. The protocol was the same as above until DNA precipitation in 4&#x000b0;C ethanol. DNA was then extracted with CTAB/Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) buffer <xref rid="pone.0051528-Lodhi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> to remove phenolics, polysaccharides, and other PCR inhibitors. DNA was purified on a hydroxyapatite column <xref rid="pone.0051528-Bernardi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Seven column volumes of step gradient of 0.4 M phosphate and 1.0 M phosphate at 60&#x000b0;C were used to elute the gDNA from the column and fractions containing <italic>Conus consors</italic> gDNA were pooled. The <italic>Conus consors</italic> genomic DNA isolated using this revised protocol did not exhibit any pigment and was of typical viscosity. Analysis on 0.8% agarose gel indicated the pooled DNA was larger than 10 Kbp in size. UV/Vis spectrum of the pooled DNA showed a 260 nm/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.78, and a 260 nm/230 nm absorbance ratio of 1.99.

The assembled mtDNA sequence was 16,112 bp in size.

Based on analogy in the mitochondrial genomes of <italic>Lophiotoma cerithiformis</italic> and <italic>Ilyanassa obsoleta</italic>, the intergenic sequence between <italic>trnF</italic> and <italic>cox3</italic> was suggested to represent the CR in the mitochondrial genome of <italic>C. textile</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0051528-Bandyopadhyay2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Indeed, in <italic>C. consors</italic>, the mtDNA region between <italic>trnF</italic> and <italic>cox3</italic> showed several CR-specific characteristics: (I) the sequence represented the longest non-coding region in the mitochondrial genome, (II) exhibited a high (A/T) content (70.3%) and (III) contained possible stem-loop-like secondary structures as well as (IV) repetitive elements.</p><p>Interestingly, numerous homopolymeric sequence motifs (poly(A), poly(T) and a long poly(AT) tandem repeat stretch) were detected in the putative mtDNA CR of <italic>C. consors</italic>, while no comparable sequence motifs were reported in the mitochondrial genomes of <italic>C. textile</italic> and <italic>C. borgesi</italic>. In these cone snail species, the corresponding intergenic mtDNA sequence was found to be more than five times shorter than in <italic>C. consors</italic>. Recently, a partial nuclear genome of another cone snail (<italic>Conus bullatus</italic>) has been reported <xref rid="pone.0051528-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. None of the <italic>C. bullatus</italic> contigs provided matches against the putative mtDNA CR detected in the cone snails <italic>C. consors</italic>, <italic>C. borgesi</italic> and <italic>C. textile</italic>. Based on homology, some short contigs belong to the mitochondrial genome but no full-length sequence is available. Therefore, the existence of a similar CR on the mitochondrial genome of <italic>C. bullatus</italic> is currently unclear.</p><p>In order to exclude potential artifacts due to sequencing and/or data assembling repeated regions in the control region, the corresponding mtDNA section was further investigated. The original assembly which was based on Roche/454 sequencing reads contained 44 (AT) tandem repeat motifs (poly(AT)<sub>44</sub>) in the putative CR. Additional reads obtained from Illumina/Solexa sequencing were not useful to estimate the exact length of the poly(AT) stretch. These reads either ended before the poly(AT) sequence motif or reached up to a maximum of seven (AT) tandem repeats (poly(AT)<sub>7</sub>) only (data not shown). However, the other parts of the CR were well covered and confirmed the existence of long intergenic sequence motifs in the mitochondrial genome of <italic>C. consors</italic>. In addition, homology studies indicated that the CR did not exhibit any sequence homology in the nuclear genome of <italic>C. consors</italic> (data not shown). Thereby the possibility that sequencing reads from the nuclear genome had been misassembled into the mitochondrial genome was excluded.</p><p>The putative CR between <italic>trnF</italic> and <italic>cox3</italic> in the mitochondrial genome of <italic>C. consors</italic> represents the longest non-coding mtDNA sequence known among the cone snail species investigated so far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051528-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Although differing in length, this mtDNA region in <italic>C. consors</italic>, <italic>C. borgesi</italic> and <italic>C. textile</italic> is sharing one common aspect: All three mitochondrial genomes contain a short inverted repeat (IR1) motif that is very similar regarding sequence and location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051528-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>C. textile</italic> and <italic>C. borgesi</italic>, the IR1 contains 18 bp and 19 bp, respectively. Here, in <italic>C. consors</italic>, the IR1 was found to be shorter (8 bp) and immediately followed by a long segment, which is missing in the mtDNA of the other two cone snail species.</p><p>Furthermore, another, even longer inverted repeat (IR2) sequence motif consisting of more than 70 bp and surrounding the stretch of poly(AT) tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051528-g001">Figure 1</xref>) was found in the mitochondrial genome of <italic>C. consors</italic>. However, the exact length of the IR2 region remained unclear due to the existence of poly(T) and poly(A) sequence motifs. Based on the original assembly, the IR2 contained poly(T)<sub>12</sub> and poly(A)<sub>16</sub> homopolymers. Interestingly, manual validation with additional Illumina/Solexa sequencing reads resulted in longer homopolymer tracts, poly(T)<sub>22</sub> and poly(A)<sub>22</sub>, respectively.</p><p>In order to verify and to determine the exact length of the poly(T) and poly(A) IR2 sequence motifs, the putative CR was also analyzed in an additional and independent PCR-based approach followed by classical Sanger sequencing. Since poly(AT) motifs have been reported to create problems in CR sequencing <xref rid="pone.0051528-Machida1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051528-Maynard1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, this experimental strategy was also employed to determine the exact length of the poly(AT) stretch. Optimized PCR protocols were developed and applied to amplify the IR2 sequence parts containing the poly(T) and poly(A) motifs as well as the poly(AT) stretch. PCR-based amplification of both IR2 sequence parts including the poly(T) and poly(A) motifs was successful. However, in case of the poly(AT) stretch, no distinct PCR products of the expected size were obtained. PCR products exhibiting the expected size (poly(T) and poly(A) analyses) or an approximate size (poly(AT) analyses) were employed for Sanger sequencing.</p><p>Sequence analyses of multiple clones confirmed the existence of both IR2 poly(T) and poly(A) sequence motifs as well as the presence of poly(AT) tandem repeats. The length of the homopolymeric poly(T) and poly(A) sequence motifs and the poly(AT) tandem repeat stretch could not exactly be determined. However, the data obtained by Sanger sequencing suggested that, most likely, both homopolymeric IR2 sequence motifs (poly(T) and poly(A)) are 18 or 19 bp in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051528-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0051528-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0051528.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Analyses of poly(T) and poly(A) motifs in the IR2 sequence of <italic>Conus consors</italic>.</title><p>25 clones representing the first IR2 sequence part (blue bars; primer pair F/R-1.1, PCR product includes poly(T) stretch) and 17 clones representing the second IR2 sequence part (red bars; primer pair F/R-1.3, PCR product includes poly(A) stretch) were sequenced according to Sanger and analyzed. Since, the quality of the poly(A) sequences obtained had been suboptimal, the reverse complement sequences containing a poly(T) stretch instead of the poly(A) motif were analyzed. For both IR2 sequence parts investigated, variations in length due to the phenomenon of strand slippage were observed. Accordingly, it was not possible to determine the exact length of the poly(T) and the poly(A) stretches. Most likely, both homopolymeric sequence motifs are 18 or 19 bp in length.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0051528.g003"/></fig><p>In order to determine the exact length of the poly(AT) tandem repeat stretch and to exclude errors of the sequencing data by contamination with genomic DNA, a novel protocol for the extraction of mtDNA from cone snail tissue was established and pure mtDNA was employed for Sanger sequencing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051528.s002">Data S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051528.s003">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051528.s004">S3</xref>). The existence of the poly(AT) sequence motif was confirmed by this experimental strategy. However, the exact length of the stretch was still not clear, since the detected signals could not be analyzed after 10 to 12 poly(AT) tandem repeats (data not shown).</p><p>In invertebrates the CR apparently lacks conserved sequence blocks and is not as well characterized as in vertebrates. However, it is known that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mtDNA the origin of the light/minor coding strand is located in the middle of the large AT-rich non-coding region <xref rid="pone.0051528-Wolstenholme1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Increased AT-content is one characteristic that is used for the identification of the replication origins. Similarly, the AT-rich section in <italic>C. consors</italic> mtDNA could refer to the existence of the replication origin inside the intergenic sequence between the genes for <italic>trnF</italic> and <italic>cox3</italic>. Among vertebrate species, the conserved sequence located around the replication origin of the light strand could form stem-loop configuration which is suggested to be required for the initiation of replication by acting as the recognition structure for the mitochondrial primase enzyme <xref rid="pone.0051528-Hixson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The analysis of the secondary structure of the mtDNA molecule via <italic>mfold</italic> showed that the region preceding the IR2 has a potential to form stem-loop-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051528-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

However, this region is even longer (848 bp) and does not align well with the putative CR in the mitochondrial genome of <italic>C. consors</italic>. Both regions share short and very similar segments, including the preceding mtDNA sequence and also 39 bp of the IR2 sequence motif itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051528-g005">Figure 5</xref>). It would be of interest to investigate the possible correlation of this observation with the venomous function. So far, no long IRs in the CR of the mitochondrial genome of <italic>T. dimidiata</italic> have been reported. However, in that genome, a short (10 bp) IR is located in the mtDNA region which is homologous to the IR2 sequence motif of <italic>C. consors</italic>. In addition, the intergenic mtDNA sequence between <italic>trnF</italic> and <italic>cox3</italic> in <italic>T. dimidiata</italic> contains a poly(AT) motif, but it is shorter and preceded by a poly(AC) tandem repeat. No similar mtDNA segments were observed between the putative control region of <italic>C. consors</italic> and the largest intergenic sequence of <italic>Cancellaria cancellata</italic>, located between the genes for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (<italic>nad1</italic>) and the tRNA for proline (<italic>trnP</italic>). The CR is found to be the fastest evolving region of the mtDNA <xref rid="pone.0051528-Aquadro1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051528-Cann1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It is hard to speculate which specific mechanisms are involved in the CR variation among cone snails. In some organisms long non-coding regions were shown to contain pseudogenes <xref rid="pone.0051528-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051528-Arndt1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, no known pseudogenes were observed in the mtDNA of <italic>C. consors</italic>. When comparing the intergenic mtDNA region between <italic>trnF</italic> and <italic>cox3</italic> with the whole mitochondrial genome sequence, no homologies were found that would refer to duplications of the coding areas. Also, no homologies were detected when compared to the corresponding nuclear genome sequence. A comparative study of the mitochondrial genomes from other cone snail species and neogastropods would be useful to estimate the extent of variation of the long non-coding mtDNA sequences in this group. It is likely that the variable control region will prove to be additional feasible and valuable marker sequence for phylogenetic analysis of cone snails or neogastropods. The existence of comparable region in <italic>T. dimidiata</italic> supports the potential usability, however due to the limited number of available mitochondrial genome sequences among neogastropods it remains to be studied in the future.</p><p>Tandem repeats (like poly(AT) motifs) as well as the high (A/T) content are well known features of the CRs in animal mtDNA <xref rid="pone.0051528-Boore1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

It is also possible that those mtDNA regions could be highly polymorphic. Previously, several variations of the poly(AT) stretches in molluskan mitochondrial genomes have been reported <xref rid="pone.0051528-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051528-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051528-Gjetvaj1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Therefore, it would be reasonable to compare the lengths of the poly(AT) stretches in other specimens of <italic>C. consors</italic> to prove whether such polymorphisms also occur in this cone snail species. On the other hand, several variations of the mtDNA region may exist due to a phenomenon called strand slippage which can occur during enzymatic replication. Strand slippage is a result of mispairing between the template and the newly synthesized strand and can occur especially when long homopolymeric and/or short tandem repeat sequence motifs are present.</p><p>Several sequence motifs similar to well known <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements are also present in the mtDNA CR of <italic>C. consors</italic>.

It is possible that the mtDNA sequence region around the poly(AT) stretch in <italic>C. consors</italic> exhibits a similar function.
