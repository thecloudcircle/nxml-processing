In this study, a new mannitol stearate ester-based aluminum alkoxide (MSE-Al) was designed and synthesized as a novel additive for PVC. The thermal stability and processing performance of PVC stabilized by MSE-Al were evaluated by the Congo red test, conductivity measurement, thermal aging test, ultravioletevisible (UV&#x02013;Vis) spectroscopy test, and torque rheometer test. Results showed that the addition of MSE-Al could not only markedly improve the long-term thermal stability of PVC, but also greatly accelerate the plasticizing and decrease the balance torque, which demonstrated that MSE-Al possessed a lubricating property. Thus, MSE-Al was demonstrated to be able to provide tri-functional additive roles, e.g., thermal stabilizer, plasticizer, and lubricant. The test results for the thermal stability of PVC indicated that the initial whiteness of PVC stabilized by MSE-Al was not good enough, thus the synergistic effect of MSE-Al with zinc stearates (ZnSt<sub>2</sub>) on the thermal stability of PVC was also investigated. The results showed that there is an appreciable synergistic effect between MSE-Al and ZnSt<sub>2</sub>. The thermal stabilization mechanism and synergism effect of MSE-Al with ZnSt<sub>2</sub> are then discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>poly(vinyl chloride)</kwd><kwd>tri-functional additive</kwd><kwd>mannitol stearate ester-based aluminum alkoxides</kwd><kwd>synergistic effect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-polymers-11-01031"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is formed by the polymerization of a vinyl chloride monomer. PVC has many attractive characteristics, for example, corrosion resistance, wear resistance, flame retardancy and insulation, and therefore has been widely used in industries, agriculture, construction, electric power, and so on. PVC has become one of the most widely used plastics in the world because of its outstanding properties [<xref rid="B1-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to defects in the chain structure, there is a small amount of unstable chlorine in PVC. When PVC is exposed to heat, ultraviolet radiation, etc., unstable chlorine atoms are released in the form of hydrogen chloride. Unsaturated C&#x02013;C bonds will appear in the molecular chains of PVC. The unsaturated C&#x02013;C bonds will lead to newly emerged unstable chlorine atoms, for instance, allyl chloride. Thermal degradation would normally occur when PVC is heated to more than 100 &#x000b0;C, while the processing temperature of PVC is 180 &#x000b0;C. Thus, thermal stabilizers must be added to improve the thermal stability of PVC during processing. Furthermore, being a strong Lewis acid, hydrogen chloride produced from the degradation of PVC catalyzes the further degradation of PVC. This leads to the formation of a &#x0201c;zipper&#x0201d; dehydrochlorination reaction, resulting in a change in the color of PVC (from white to brown, and finally to black), which further changes the properties of the PVC [<xref rid="B4-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In general, PVC thermal stabilizers should have at least two functions: (1) replacing or passivating labile chlorine atoms in the PVC chain, such as allyl chloride atoms, preventing the formation of conjugated double bonds; and (2) absorbing or neutralizing HCl produced during the degradation of PVC to inhibit the autocatalytic dehydrochlorination reaction [<xref rid="B6-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At present, common thermal stabilizers of PVC include lead salts [<xref rid="B9-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], organotin [<xref rid="B6-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], rare earth [<xref rid="B10-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], calcium and zinc soap salts (especially the calcium and zinc stearates) [<xref rid="B11-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The lead salts have an excellent long-term thermal stability, simple production process and low price. However, due to the toxicity on humans and the environment, their use has been restricted. The organotin thermal stabilizers are effective, but they are often used in high-grade PVC products because of the complex production processes and high production costs, which reduce their competitiveness with other thermal stabilizers. Moreover, certain organotins based on mercaptides also generate unpleasant odors [<xref rid="B6-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The rare earth thermal stabilizers are similar to organotin, but more expensive than the others, and the cost hinders the widespread application of rare earth thermal stabilizers. Ca/Zn soap salts are non-toxic, environmentally friendly thermal stabilizers. Calcium stearate (CaSt<sub>2</sub>) and zinc stearate (ZnSt<sub>2</sub>) stabilizers contain fatty acid root, which gives these thermal stabilizers good lubrication properties, and they are relatively easy to process [<xref rid="B12-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, ZnSt<sub>2</sub> has an ability to replace the active chloride atom and then significantly increase the initial color of PVC. Thus PVC products with Ca/Zn thermal stabilizers have a good initial color and smooth surface characteristics. However, the reaction of ZnSt<sub>2</sub> to replace the active chloride atom and to absorb HCl will produce zinc chloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>). ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, as a Lewis acid that can play a catalytic role in the degradation of PVC, would further accelerate degradation of PVC. When the accumulation of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> reaches a certain amount, the degradation rate of PVC will increase suddenly, making the PVC product quickly turn black. This phenomenon is called &#x0201c;zinc burning&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B14-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In order to avoid this phenomenon, ZnSt<sub>2</sub> is often used together with calcium stearate (CaSt<sub>2</sub>). After ZnSt<sub>2</sub> is reacted with HCl to produce ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, it can continue to react with CaSt<sub>2</sub> to form CaCl<sub>2</sub> and ZnSt<sub>2</sub>. CaCl<sub>2</sub> does not catalyze the degradation of PVC, and therefore it inhibits &#x0201c;zinc burning&#x0201d; over a period of time [<xref rid="B13-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>As an important organic auxiliary thermal stabilizer, some polyols, for example, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, trimethylolpropane, etc., are often used in combination with CaSt<sub>2</sub>/ZnSt<sub>2</sub> stabilizers to improve the long-term thermal stability of PVC [<xref rid="B16-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Polyols have a large number of hydroxyl groups that can form a stable chelate with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> to inhibit its further catalytic degradation of PVC. In previous studies, we reported the synthesis of lanthanum-pentaerythritol alkoxides [<xref rid="B17-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and aluminum-pentaerythritol alkoxides [<xref rid="B18-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and their improved performances for the thermal stability of PVC. However, most polyol-based metal alkoxides have high melting points, which make them less dispersible in PVC. In addition, polyols have a certain degree of water solubility, resulting in poor miscibility with PVC and poor PVC plasticization. The presence of these drawbacks limits the widespread use of polyol-based metal alkoxides.</p><p>In this study, mannitol stearate ester (MSE) was synthesized through a direct esterifying reaction between mannitol and stearic acid, then the mannitol stearate ester-based aluminum alkoxide (MSE-Al) was prepared through the alcohol exchange reaction between MSE and aluminum isopropoxide [<xref rid="B19-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Compared to pentaerythritol, mannitol has a lower melting point of 166 &#x000b0;C and possesses a greater number of hydroxyl groups per unit mass. The design idea was just to improve the lubricity and reduce the melting point of MSE-Al to obtain a better compatibility with PVC by introducing a stearate functional group. The results of the thermal stability test further indicated that MSE-Al could provide tri-functional additive roles, namely thermal stabilizer, plasticizer and lubricant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-polymers-11-01031"><title>2.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01031-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the PVC sheets with 4 phr of MSE-Al added showed a very light pale yellow initial color, would keep the color stable for 110 min, and did not turn black within 360 min, meaning that MSE-Al has an excellent long-term thermal stability on PVC.

We could assume that, when the complex of MSE-Al and ZnSt<sub>2</sub> were used as a PVC thermal stabilizer, the reaction rate of MSE-Al, with an active chlorine atom in PVC, and neutralizing hydrogen chloride was not as fast as zinc stearate due to steric hindrance. That is to say, when the dosage of ZnSt<sub>2</sub> in the complex is low (e.g., 1 phr), due to the low concentration of unstable structures (e.g., allyl chloride) in PVC molecules, the 1 phr of ZnSt<sub>2</sub> could replace/inactivate the allyl chloride and produce the corresponding amount of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. Having plenty of hydrogen groups, 3 phr of MSE-Al could form a stable chalet with the low content ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. When the amount of ZnSt<sub>2</sub> was increased, in addition to replacing allyl chloride, the excess ZnSt<sub>2</sub> would also react with HCl, which would produce a large amount of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. The increase in the amount of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> would make it difficult for the MSE-Al to effectively complex with the ZnCl<sub>2</sub>.

The balance torque of the PVC sample stablized by 4 phr of MSE-Al was much lower than that of pure PVC. All of the results showed that MSE-Al and ZnSt<sub>2</sub> had good lubrication.

Generally speaking, most of the common plasticizers of PVC are esters, such as phthalate esters [<xref rid="B25-polymers-11-01031" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Therefore, the good plasticizing effect of MSE-Al on PVC was because that MSE-Al had the mannitol stearate ester acting as an efficient plasticizing functional group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01031-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows that the plasticizing time of PVC stabilized by 4 phr of ZnSt<sub>2</sub> is 255 s, longer than that of pure PVC.

Furthermore, the torque rheometer test results demonstrated that MSE-Al was able to significantly enhance the plasticizing effect and lubricity of PVC.</p><p>The thermal stability of PVC samples stabilized by MSE-Al, and MSE-Al/ZnSt<sub>2</sub> was also evaluated by Congo red tests, conductivity measurements, thermal aging tests, and UV-vis spectroscopy tests. The results showed that MSE-Al could significantly improve the long-term thermal stability of PVC, attributed to the fact that MSE-Al replaced the labile chlorine atoms in the PVC chain and had an ability to neutralize HCl. A synergistic effect between MSE-Al and ZnSt<sub>2</sub> was observed. It was also found that PVC stabilized by 3 phr of MSE-Al and 1 phr of ZnSt<sub>2</sub> showed a good initial color and excellent long-term thermal stability. This was because ZnSt<sub>2</sub> had a strong ability to absorb hydrogen chloride, and MSE-Al would not only replace unstable chlorine atoms in the PVC chain, but also chelate the ZnCl<sub>2</sub> produced by absorption of HCl by ZnSt<sub>2</sub>, thereby inhibiting the &#x0201c;zinc burning&#x0201d; phenomenon.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Formal analysis, B.A.; Funding acquisition, D.L.; Investigation, W.H., D.L., M.Z., T.D., and H.S.; Project administration, D.L.; Resources, D.L.; Writing&#x02014;original draft, W.H.; Writing&#x02014;review and editing, D.L., J.D., and H.S.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the University Research Program of Shandong Provincial Department of Education (No. J16LC24), the SDUT and Zibo City Integration Development Project (No. 2016ZBXC057), the Yellow River Delta Research Institute Innovation Research Fund Project, and the project of Zhaoyuan industrial technology research institute, shandong university of technology.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-polymers-11-01031"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Avalos</surname><given-names>A.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hakkarainen</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Odelius</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Superiorly plasticized PVC/PBSA blends through crotonic and acrylic acid functionalization of PVC</article-title><source>Polymers</source><year>2017</year><volume>9</volume><elocation-id>84</elocation-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/polym9030084</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">30970763</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2-polymers-11-01031"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Q.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhan</surname><given-names>H.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Y.Q.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>X.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Y.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Synthesis and Study of Zinc Orotate and Its Synergistic Effect with Commercial Stabilizers for Stabilizing Poly(Vinyl Chloride)</article-title><source>Polymers</source><year>2019</year><volume>11</volume><elocation-id>194</elocation-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/polym11020194</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">30960179</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3-polymers-11-01031"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>T.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>D.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>W.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>L.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sunarso</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>S.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Design and synthesis of polyol ester-based zinc metal alkoxides as a bi-functional thermal stabilizer for poly(vinyl chloride)</article-title><source>Polym.
