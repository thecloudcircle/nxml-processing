The currently available metal clips are made of pure titanium (Ti) and Ti alloys, which are strong and ductile enough to occlude vessels in soft tissues using forceps. However, Ti clips have several drawbacks; they form metallic artifacts, which hamper the image quality in computed tomography (CT) evaluations, and they permanently remain in the human body, sometimes resulting in adhesion or endo-clip penetration and migration.

Besides suitable biodegradability, it requires sufficient ductility and mechanical strength for enabling tissue ligation. Considering this, we developed a novel metal clip made of Mg alloys, which has enough strength for ligation, biodegradability, and reduces artifacts on CT imaging.

Two rats were placed inside each cage in a temperature-controlled room, with food and water provided ad libitum under a 12-h light/dark diurnal cycle. Operations were conducted under general anesthesia with isoflurane. The animals were placed in a supine position, and laparotomy was performed with a midline abdominal incision. After the median lobe was retracted to the cranial side and the caudate lobe to the caudal side, the vascular pedicle, including hepatic artery, portal vein, bile duct, and hepatic vein of the left lateral lobe, was encircled. Lastly, the pedicle was ligated using the Ti or Mg alloy clip, and the left lateral lobe was removed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

In addition, there was no evidence that the serum concentration of Mg elevated throughout the observation period.</p><p id="Par33">Our Mg alloy clips possessed sufficient properties for the 10-min occlusion of a renal vein in a rat model, and for the 24-week occlusion of a cystic duct in a canine model. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] However, the hemostatic performance and the degradation behavior of our Mg alloy clips after vessel sealing for a long observation period has not been evaluated yet. When we apply the Mg alloy clip for vessel sealing, we should consider the effects of the blood flow on the clip. After tightening the clip, it might cause absorption from the blood vessel wall or come in direct contact with the blood flow of capillary vessels. These conditions may induce rapid degradation of the clip, considerable hydrogen gas production, and elevation of serum Mg levels resulting in failure of vessel sealing. In this study, we first applied our Mg alloy clip for vessel sealing in rat hepatectomy and demonstrated that our Mg alloy clips possess sufficient characteristics for vessel sealing during hepatectomy.</p><p id="Par34">Pure Mg has excellent biodegradability in a physiological environment. However, in turn, this high degradation rate of pure Mg and the resulting evolution of hydrogen gas are the main obstacles to clinical application as a surgical clip. To regulate the degradation velocity, several previous studies devised methods of coating using other materials such as gold, silicon, and polymer; these coating methods resulted in slow degradation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] However, the surface coating is in danger of peeling off through mechanical irritation during surgery or postoperatively. Moreover, it may trigger localized degradation through crevice corrosion. Therefore, we need to develop new ways to overcome this in vivo instability. Our Mg alloy clips showed continuous biodegradability in the abdominal cavity and approximately 64% of them were absorbed at 24&#x02009;weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This is slower than that seen in the canine cholecystectomy model; approximately 87% of the clips were absorbed at 24&#x02009;weeks. This difference in biodegradability may be affected by the differences among animal species, targets of Mg alloy clips and circumstances of their placement. Altogether, we believe that this degradation speed is sufficient for vessel sealing because the clot formation in the vessel occurred early after tightening the clip.</p><p id="Par35">Metallic artifacts that interfere with CT and magnetic resonance imaging are problematic. Modern CT units can reduce metallic artifacts induced by Ti or stainless steel by using advanced technologies. However, they result in reduced image quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or high peak voltage of x-ray radiation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] Previous studies reported that replacing metal clips with polymeric absorbable clips reduce the artifacts. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] However, currently available polymer clips have several disadvantages compared with metal clips. Since they are thicker and larger than metal clips, surgeons feel that it is difficult to close vessels without the sufficient margin of clipping. In addition, it is difficult to remove them because they have a rigid outer polyglycolic body or locking system. In contrast, our previous studies demonstrated that Mg alloy clips form fewer metallic artifacts than that with Ti clips. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] Moreover, this study demonstrated that an Mg alloy clip maintains its shape for 12&#x02009;weeks, the volume of the clip gradually decreases because of its biodegradability, and that metallic artifacts eventually completely disappear. Thus, visualization of ligation after using clips with minimal artifacts provides a sense of security when postoperative CT is performed to determine the cause of complications, at least in the perioperative period. Conversely, disappearance of the clips facilitates accurate diagnosis of recurrence of cancers without artifacts in the late postoperative phase.</p><p id="Par36">In liver surgery, many vascular structures need to be ligated and divided during parenchymal transection. Over the last three decades, open and laparoscopic liver resection has been increasingly performed for the treatment of liver diseases, but the type of instruments by energy sources and technique used for hepatic transection vary among institutions. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] Although various vessel-sealing devices and ultrasonic scalpels have been developed and widely used, whether vascular systems, including bile ducts and thick vessels, are completely occluded with these devices has not been proven. Conversely, clip ligation of biliary and vascular structures is a safe and time-saving technique compared to ligation with thread. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Thus, we believe that Mg alloy clips are useful for ligation of biliary and vascular structures during hepatectomy. Additionally, surgeons who prefer metal clips to polymeric clips would believe that our Mg alloy clips close thin vessels relatively easily and remove themselves in mis-ligation cases similar to Ti clips.</p><p id="Par37">The price of Mg alloys is an important issue. The market prices of raw Mg is approximately less than one third of that of Ti, and the melting temperatures of Ti and Mg are 1941&#x02009;K and 923&#x02009;K, respectively. These facts indicate that the fabrication cost of the present Mg-Zn-Ca alloy is considerably lower than that of conventional Ti alloy for medical application (e.g., Ti-6Al-4&#x02009;V alloy). Therefore, we expect that the production cost of our Mg alloy clips would be lower than that of currently available Ti clips. Furthermore, the deformation behavior of our Mg alloy is relatively similar to that of Ti, compared with a polymer material, due to the work-hardening property and/or plastic deformation capability. This suggests that the Mg alloy clips can be used with conventional clip dispensers. We believe that this ability also contributes to the total production cost.</p><p id="Par38">The main limitation of this study is that we only used a minimum number of healthy small animals for hepatectomy. Hepatectomy for patients with liver tumors requires much more ligation of vessels and leads to more intraoperative bleeding and postoperative ascites that might influence the degradation behavior of the Mg alloy clips. Thus, further examinations, including hepatectomy, in large animals are required to apply the Mg alloy clips in clinical situations.</p><p id="Par39">In this study, we revealed that Mg alloy clips enabled closure of vessels with good hemostasis. In addition, there was no evidence that the serum Mg concentration elevated, and the degradation behavior was not problematic when we applied the biodegradable Mg alloy clips for vessel ligation in rat hepatectomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">This study aimed to examine the tolerability and safety of the novel biodegradable Mg alloy clips compared with those of standard Ti clips for hepatectomy in a rat model. These Mg alloy clips have the potential to replace standard metal clips in the near future. However, further studies are needed to investigate the use of biodegradable Mg alloy clips for the same indication in large animals as well as in clinical human models.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p id="Par5">Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p id="Par6">Aspartate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ca</term><def><p id="Par7">calcium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cre</term><def><p id="Par8">creatinine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par9">Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Mg</term><def><p id="Par10">magnesium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MR</term><def><p id="Par11">Magnetic resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ti</term><def><p id="Par12">titanium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Zn</term><def><p id="Par13">zinc</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Tomoo Ito and Dr. Masayuki Akita for their great efforts in evaluating the histologic findings.
