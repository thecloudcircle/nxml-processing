Elucidating the mechanism by which E2A-PBX1 induces lymphoid leukemia would be expedited by the availability of a tractable experimental model in which enforced expression of E2A-PBX1 in hematopoietic progenitors induces pre-B-cell ALL. However, hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated mice with bone marrow infected with E2A-PBX1-expressing retroviruses consistently gives rise to myeloid, not lymphoid, leukemia. Here, we elucidate the hematopoietic consequences of forced E2A-PBX1 expression in primary murine hematopoietic progenitors. We show that introducing E2A-PBX1 into multipotent progenitors permits the retention of myeloid potential but imposes a dense barrier to lymphoid development prior to the common lymphoid progenitor stage, thus helping to explain the eventual development of myeloid, and not lymphoid, leukemia in transplanted mice. Our findings also indicate that E2A-PBX1 enforces the aberrant, persistent expression of some genes that would normally have been down-regulated in the subsequent course of hematopoietic maturation. We show that enforced expression of one such gene, <italic>Hoxa9</italic>, a proto-oncogene associated with myeloid leukemia, partially reproduces the phenotype produced by E2A-PBX1 itself. Existing evidence suggests that the 1;19 translocation event takes place in committed B-lymphoid progenitors. However, we find that retrovirus-enforced expression of E2A-PBX1 in committed pro-B-cells results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our findings indicate that the neoplastic phenotype induced by E2A-PBX1 is determined by the developmental stage of the cell into which the oncoprotein is introduced.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by operating grants to DPL from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP-81333), The Cancer Research Society and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Canada.

Approximately 5% of ALL cases are associated with a reciprocal translocation between chromosome bands 1q23 and 19p13.3 [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the vast majority of cases, this leads to the fusion of the <italic>E2A</italic> (also called <italic>TCF3</italic>) and <italic>PBX1</italic> genes, resulting at the protein level in fusion of the N-terminal two thirds of E2A with most of PBX1 to create the oncogenic transcription factor E2A-PBX1. Relative to other B-progenitor ALL subtypes, leukemic blasts with t(1;19) typically manifest a more mature immunophenotype characterized by expression of cytoplasmic &#x003bc; heavy chain thus justifying the term &#x0201c;pre-B-cell ALL&#x0201d; to denote such cases [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Although t(1;19) is associated almost exclusively with pre-B-cell ALL, B-lymphoid disease is generally not replicated in murine models of E2A-PBX1 oncogenesis. In the initial transgenic mouse model, E2A-PBX1 expression directed by the E&#x003bc; enhancer resulted in T-progenitor lymphoma after a brief latency period [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. More recently, Bijl <italic>et al</italic>. were successful in forcing the development of B-progenitor ALL by crossing CD3&#x003b5;<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which fail to develop mature T-cells, with transgenic mice expressing E2A-PBX1 under the control of lymphoid specific promoter/enhancer elements [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some of these progeny developed leukemia that manifested B-lymphoid immunophenotypic features and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements after a long latency period, although in half of the cases a combined lymphoid/myeloid phenotype was evident. Therefore, these transgenic approaches have not addressed the need for an experimentally tractable model of E2A-PBX1-driven pre-B-cell leukemia in order to elucidate mechanistic aspects of E2A-PBX1-mediated oncogenesis in the context of B-lymphopoiesis.</p><p>Adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells that have been transduced <italic>ex vivo</italic> with an E2A-PBX1-expressing retroviral vector generally leads to an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm, although instances of T-progenitor ALL have also been observed [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These transplantation studies have not adequately delineated the impact of E2A-PBX1 on lymphopoiesis, in part because the phenotypic analyses performed on engrafted, E2A-PBX1-expressing cells were carried out after the recipient animals began to show signs of illness, when the bone marrow was densely packed with immature myeloid progenitors rendering it difficult to assess the effect of E2A-PBX1 on non-myeloid lineages. Furthermore, these experiments were carried out using retroviral vectors that did not allow transduced cells and their progeny to be distinguished on a cell-by-cell basis by flow cytometry.</p><p>Therefore, the need persists to investigate the hematopoietic impact of E2A-PBX1 on the fate of early progenitors in order to elucidate E2A-PBX1 function and inform the eventual development of an experimentally tractable model of E2A-PBX1-induced B-lymphoid ALL. In the present study, we establish stable, retrovirus-mediated expression of E2A-PBX1 in uncommitted hematopoietic progenitors or committed B-lymphoid progenitors and determine the hematopoietic and transcriptional consequences <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mice</title><p>BALB/c mice 8&#x02013;12 weeks old were purchased from Charles River and housed in the Queen&#x02019;s University Animal Care Facility.

Furthermore, co-staining for CD4 and CD8 showed a marked impairment in the ability of E2A-PBX1-expressing cells to mature beyond the double-negative stage. Equivalent results were observed in 4 animals transplanted with E2A-PBX1-transduced cells. Therefore, retrovirus-enforced expression of E2A-PBX1 in lin<sup>-</sup> bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors markedly impairs lymphoid development and, in particular, imposes an almost absolute block to B-lymphopoiesis.</p><fig id="pone.0130495.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0130495.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>E2A-PBX1-expressing bone marrow cells reconstitute early myeloid but not B-lymphoid development in transplanted mice.</title><p>Primary murine bone marrow cells were transduced with E2A-PBX1-expressing or control retroviral vectors and injected into the tail vein of lethally-irradiated, syngeneic recipient mice.

Therefore, the competency of E2A-PBX1-expressing, lineage-uncommitted progenitors to respond to environmental signals that normally induce B-lymphoid differentiation was investigated using an established, more experimentally tractable <italic>in vitro</italic> system. Lin<sup>-</sup> hematopoietic progenitors harvested from day 12 to 14 fetal livers differentiate to committed pro-B-cells (also called &#x0201c;pre-B1 cells&#x0201d;) after 9 to 14 days of co-culture with OP9 stromal cells in the presence of IL-7 and SCF [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Whereas the immunophenotype of control cells confirmed their CD45R<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup>, B-lymphoid-committed, status (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), most E2A-PBX1-transduced cells displayed a relatively immature, lineage-ambiguous phenotype characterized by the absence of CD45R or CD19, persistent expression of abundant CD117 and Sca-1, and variable expression of IL-7R and CD11b. Initially, minor populations of CD45R<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup> (24%) and CD45R<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>-</sup> (11%) cells were observed. While the CD45R<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup> population was lost with continued culture (compare the CD45R/CD19 plots at 14 and 25 days), the CD45R<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>-</sup> population was retained. The presence of these cells could reflect slight leakiness of the differentiation block or the presence at the time of retroviral transduction of a small number of lin<sup>-</sup> progenitors with a bias towards the B-lymphoid fate. Equivalent results were obtained in two experiments. Despite its obvious effect on hematopoietic differentiation, expression of E2A-PBX1 did not affect growth kinetics during the first 14 days after retroviral transduction (<xref rid="pone.0130495.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). However, the ability of GFP<sup>+</sup>, E2A-PBX1-transduced cells to out-compete GFP<sup>-</sup> cells by 25 days after transduction (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) suggests the outgrowth of more proliferative subpopulations of cells many of which express E2A-PBX1 more abundantly. This is further supported by the right-ward shift in GFP signal intensity observed by day 25 for E2A-PBX1-transduced cells (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). However, given the persistent expression of CD117 in E2A-PBX1-transduced FLPs, we considered whether the immature, E2A-PBX1-transduced cells were dependent on SCF, the ligand for CD117. Lin<sup>-</sup> FLPs were deprived of SCF 5 days after transduction and the cumulative number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was determined 9 days later. E2A-PBX1-transduced FLPs suffered a greater impairment of proliferation upon SCF deprivation than did control cells, indicating greater dependency on this cytokine (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Limiting dilution in 96-well plates and the web-based ELDA tool were used to determine the prevalence of culture-initiating cells. Whereas culture-initiating cells were present at a frequency of 1/12.6 cells among vector-infected FLPs, the frequency among E2A-PBX1-infected FLPs was nine-fold higher, at 1/1.4 (95% CI 1/17.5-1/9.06 versus 1/2.13-1/0.954, respectively, p &#x0003c; 0.001); <xref rid="pone.0130495.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Equivalent results were obtained in three replicate experiments. The presence of features characteristic of early hematopoietic progenitors, including an immature immunophenotype, persistent differential responsiveness to SCF and a higher prevalence of culture-initiating cells in FLPs forced to express E2A-PBX1, supports the idea that E2A-PBX1 antagonizes aspects of hematopoietic maturation and enforces persistence of features characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or early progenitors.</p><fig id="pone.0130495.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0130495.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>E2A-PBX1 blocks B-lymphoid differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title><p>(A) Immunophenotype of E2A-PBX1-expressing FLPs after 14 days (top and middle rows) and 25 days (bottom row) of propagation in medium containing IL-7 and SCF.

The L20A amino acid substitution within activation domain 1 (AD1) of E2A-PBX1 markedly impairs binding to the transcriptional co-activator and histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 whereas the N51S substitution in the PBX1 homeodomain disrupts DNA binding [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Accordingly, FLPs were transduced with a <italic>Hoxa9</italic> retrovirus and grown under B-lymphopoietic conditions in order to investigate whether enforced expression of <italic>Hoxa9</italic> could replicate the phenotype produced by E2A-PBX1. Flow cytometry carried out 14 days after transduction demonstrated that Hoxa9 blocked B-lymphoid commitment in what appeared to be a dose-dependent manner; whereas GFP-dim cells that presumably produced Hoxa9 less abundantly succeeded in achieving CD19<sup>+</sup>, CD11b<sup>-</sup> pro-B-cell status, GFP-bright cells expressing more abundant Hoxa9 instead manifested a CD19<sup>-</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup> phenotype suggestive of myeloid differentiation (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). The PcG protein Bmi1 normally silences the B-lymphopoietic transcription factor genes <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Pax5</italic> in early, lineage-uncommitted progenitors and has been implicated as a mediator of E2A-PBX1-driven oncogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the Bmi1 transcript was not over-expressed in E2A-PBX1-expressing FLPs and retrovirus-enforced expression of Bmi1 failed to block B-lymphoid commitment (Fig <xref rid="pone.0130495.g007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0130495.g007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>).

Thus, the pre-B-cell phenotype typically observed in cases of t(1;19)-associated ALL could reflect occurrence of the leukemia-initiating translocation event in a committed B-lymphoid progenitor. In an attempt to model this leukemogenic event, FLP-derived pro-B-cells were transduced with an E2A-PBX1-expressing retroviral vector and then monitored for GFP prevalence by flow cytometry (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). The prevalence of E2A-PBX1/GFP-expressing cells declined over time in culture, indicating that E2A-PBX1 exerts an anti-proliferative effect; this experiment was carried out twice with equivalent results (data not shown). Next, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for GFP was followed over time in FLP-derived pro-B-cells versus lin<sup>-</sup> FLPs after transduction with a E2A-PBX1/GFP-expressing retrovirus (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>).

In contrast, the MFI amongst pro-B-cells declined over time, implying selection against clones expressing higher levels of E2A-PBX1. Equivalent results were obtained in multiple experiments. In order to investigate the mechanism by which E2A-PBX1 exerts its anti-proliferative effects we developed a system in which the function of E2A-PBX1 could be regulated in committed murine B-lymphoid progenitors. "Pre-B-1" cells from the bone marrow of adult mice were isolated, expanded <italic>ex vivo</italic> according to an established protocol [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and rendered stromal cell- and IL-7-independent by stable, retrovirus-mediated expression of p210<sup>BCR-ABL</sup>.

Accordingly, much of the impetus for the current study arose from a desire to understand the observation that mice transplanted with E2A-PBX1-tranduced bone marrow succumb mostly to myeloid rather than B-lymphoid neoplasms [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We also considered that elucidating differential effects of E2A-PBX1 expression on hematopoietic progenitors of diverse lineages would provide insights into E2A-PBX1 function that would inform future, more directly mechanistic studies. Our findings indicate that, when expressed in uncommitted progenitors, E2A-PBX1 antagonizes aspects of both myeloid and lymphoid maturation and enforces the persistence of phenotypic features characteristic of HSCs or early progenitors. Our results also demonstrate differential E2A-PBX1-mediated effects on lymphoid relative to myeloid differentiation: whereas impairment of myeloid differentiation is merely relative such that it permits the expansion of leukemogenic myeloid progenitors in a myeloid-inductive local environment, the block to B-lymphopoiesis is near-absolute. Furthermore, in contrast to the selective advantage it confers when introduced into uncommitted progenitors, E2A-PBX1 causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in committed B-lymphoid progenitors. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the phenotype conferred by E2A-PBX1 is critically dependent on the maturity and lineage of the hematopoietic cells into which it is introduced.</p><p>Several recent findings allow us to speculate as to how E2A-PBX1 might perturb hematopoiesis when it is introduced into lin<sup>-</sup> progenitors. Lineage specification is governed to an important degree by the lineage-specific activity of enhancers [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Wild-type PBX1 has been shown to bind DNA in a manner influenced by the presence of specific chromatin marks, and the leukemogenic transcription factors PML-RAR&#x003b1; and AML1-ETO were shown recently to bind preferentially to enhancers that are associated with accessible chromatin and local binding by p300 [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results suggesting that E2A-PBX1 must bind to DNA by means of the PBX1-derived homeodomain in order to abrogate the lymphoid lineage potential of uncommitted progenitors (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) are consistent with previous results indicating that the PBX1-derived homeodomain is required for impeding myeloid differentiation by E2A-PBX1 [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that, upon its introduction into uncommitted progenitors, E2A-PBX1 binds regulatory elements through a mechanism that involves the PBX1 homeodomain and in a genomic distribution that is determined in part by the status of local chromatin. It may then associate with transcriptional co-regulators including CBP/p300 and perturb enhancer function, thereby impairing normal maturation and promoting the expansion of progenitors that remain responsive to myeloid-inductive environmental stimuli but blocked in a proliferative stage of development. Hematopoietic lineage specification is associated with major alterations in the accessibility of the chromatin at, in particular, lineage-specific enhancers and a progressive, overall decrease in chromatin accessibility [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, the striking effect of the stage of hematopoietic cell differentiation that we have demonstrated on the phenotypic consequences of E2A-PBX1 expression could reflect the influence of different chromatin states in determining the genomic location and downstream transcriptional consequences of E2A-PBX1 binding.</p><p>In contrast to its proliferative and oncogenic effects in lin<sup>-</sup> FLPs (Figs <xref rid="pone.0130495.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0130495.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), we demonstrate that forced expression of E2A-PBX1 in FLP-derived pro-B-cells induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). The ability of E2A-PBX1 to induce apoptosis in B-lymphoid progenitors has been reported previously, albeit not in FLP-derived cells [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The distinctive response of committed B-lymphoid cells to E2A-PBX1 could reflect a cellular response to oncogene activation. For example, the ability of p185<sup>BCR-ABL</sup> to induce murine B-lineage ALL, but not myeloid neoplasia, is enhanced dramatically by inactivation of the <italic>Arf</italic> tumor suppressor gene [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. <italic>Arf</italic> lies within the <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> locus and its product, p19<sup>Arf</sup>, can induce p53-mediated cellular senescence or apoptosis in response to oncogene activation [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The differential susceptibility of FLP-derived pro-B-cells to E2A-PBX1-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest could reflect the distinctive status of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> in these cells; whereas this locus is epigenetically silenced in HSCs, it is poised for induction in committed B-progenitors [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In support of the existence of an antagonistic relationship between E2A-PBX1 and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> in the clinical context, deletions affecting <italic>CDKN2A</italic> at chromosome band 9p21 are exceptionally prevalent amongst human ALL samples associated with t(1;19) [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. More generally, our results suggest that additional oncogenic alterations, such as inactivation of tumor suppressors or activation of pro-survival oncogenes, may be required for the oncogenic effects of E2A-PBX1 to be manifested in in B-lymphoid cells. Other possible explanations for the failure of E2A-PBX1 to impart a selective growth advantage in our FLP-derived progenitors include possible deficiencies in the specific culture conditions that we provided relative to the requirements of E2A-PBX1-expressing B-lymphoid cells, failure to target E2A-PBX1 expression to a specific, more permissive stage of B-lymphoid ontogeny, and inherent differences between human and murine progenitors.</p><p>Sykes and Kamps used an approach similar to our own to investigate how the hematopoietic fate of bone marrow cells is affected by retrovirus-driven expression of E2A-PBX1 [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These authors determined that unfractionated mononuclear bone marrow cells infected with an E2A-PBX1 retrovirus and then cultivated in the presence of SCF and IL-7 developed into early T-lymphoid progenitors, whereas control cells developed into CD19-expressing pro-B-cells. Although methodological differences, including the use of bone marrow- versus FLP-derived progenitors for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, impede direct comparison of this study with our own, it is noteworthy that, whereas the evidence supporting T-lymphoid lineage was derived exclusively from <italic>in vitro</italic> data, our current study is the first to include transplantation experiments in which the lineage potential of E2A-PBX1-expressing lin<sup>-</sup> hematopoietic cells was determined directly in reconstituted mice. Instead of an expansion of T-lymphoid progenitors, we demonstrate profound defects in thymic seeding and thymocyte development by E2A-PBX1-transduced cells and a dramatic expansion of Gr-1<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> myelomonocytic progenitors in the bone marrow and spleen (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). These findings are corroborated in our <italic>in vitro</italic> FLP model: the lymphoid potential of lin<sup>-</sup> FLPs expressing E2A-PBX1 is blocked prior to the CLP stage (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), these FLPs are amenable to myeloid differentiation induced by GM-CSF, and they confer myeloid leukemia upon transplanted mice (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). We infer from our findings that the myeloid phenotype of the neoplasms that generally develop in mice transplanted with E2A-PBX1-expressing bone marrow is explained by a profound reduction of T- and B-lymphoid potential that is imposed early, prior to the CLP stage, coupled with retention of myeloid lineage potential. We speculate that the T-progenitor neoplasms that occasionally develop in mice transplanted with E2A-PBX1-transduced bone marrow cells may be explicable based on the relatively greater ability of E2A-PBX1-expressing progenitors to penetrate into the pool of committed T- relative to B-lymphoid progenitors (compare Fig <xref rid="pone.0130495.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0130495.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>)[<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Two of the genes that we demonstrate to be up-regulated in E2A-PBX1-expressing FLPs, <italic>Mycn</italic> and <italic>Meis1</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0130495.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), were identified recently among genes that were down-regulated in early myeloid progenitors from <italic>Pbx1</italic>-null mice, suggesting an overlap between genes regulated by wild-type Pbx1 and E2A-PBX1 in the myeloid context [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Meis1 is also a dimerization partner of wild-type Pbx1 [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. <italic>Meis1</italic> expression has been associated with both increased self-renewal and increased SCF responsiveness [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Hoxa9 can block myeloid differentiation, immortalize myeloid progenitor cells and collaborate with Meis1 and E2A-PBX1 in the induction of murine AML [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We and other investigators have shown that <italic>Meis1</italic> and <italic>Hoxa9</italic> are expressed in HSCs but subsequently down-regulated during differentiation (<xref rid="pone.0130495.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In investigating a possible role for Hoxa9 in mediating the effects of E2A-PBX1, we observed that when lin<sup>-</sup> FLPs are infected with a Hoxa9-expressing retrovirus, only cells that express Hoxa9 especially abundantly manifest blocked B-lymphopoiesis; Hoxa9-expressing cells were enriched in cells expressing CD11b relative to cells infected with an E2A-PBX1 virus (compare Figs <xref rid="pone.0130495.g007" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0130495.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), suggesting that Hoxa9 is less effective than E2A-PBX1 in blocking myeloid differentiation. These observations suggest that factors in addition to Hoxa9 contribute to the differentiation block imposed by E2A-PBX1. Especially pertinent to this possibility are the findings of Wang and colleagues, who showed that lin<sup>-</sup>, bone marrow-derived progenitors subjected to retrovirus-enforced co-expression of <italic>Hoxa9</italic> and <italic>Meis1</italic> were more impaired with respect to B-lymphopoiesis and more potent in initiating acute myeloid leukemia than were cells transduced with <italic>Hoxa9</italic> alone, suggesting that Hoxa9 and Meis1 may cooperate to mediate the hematopoietic effects of E2A-PBX1 that we observed in our experiments [<xref rid="pone.0130495.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the failure of mouse bone marrow transplantation experiments to model to E2A-PBX1-induced B-lymphoid neoplasia is attributable to the ability of E2A-PBX1 to block B-lymphoid commitment prior to the CLP stage while permitting retention of myeloid potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130495.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Growth curves are shown from from lin<sup>-</sup> fetal liver cells infected with a retroviral vector expressing E2A-PBX1b (EP1b, dashed lines) or a control, empty vector (MIEV, solid lines).</title><p>Results are shown for experiments lasting 14 (red lines) or 15 (blue lines) days after retroviral transduction.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130495.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130495.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Effects of the functional induction of E2A-PBX1 on the morphology of B-lymphoid progenitors.</title><p>B-lymphoid 3PER12 cells stably expressing EP&#x00394;623ER and cultured for 72 hours in the presence of estradiol (E2) appeared small and refractile compared to control cells treated with ethanol alone (vehicle), suggesting the occurrence of widespread apoptosis.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130495.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130495.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Antibodies used for flow cytometry.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130495.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130495.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Genes expressed differentially at least four-fold in E2A-PBX1-expressing fetal liver progenitors relative to control pro-B-cells.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130495.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130495.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Expression patterns of genes expressed differentially downstream of E2A-PBX1 in primary lin- and myeloid cells.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130495.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130495.s006"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Probe ID numbers of genes in KEGG pathways overrepresented by genes up-regulated downstream of E2A-PBX1.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130495.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130495.s007"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Probe ID numbers of genes in KEGG pathways overrepresented by genes down-regulated downstream of E2A-PBX1.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130495.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Erin Burnett for assistance with mouse husbandry, Dr. Barbara Kee for helpful advice on experimental procedures, Dr. Christopher Paige for providing the J558-IL-7 cells, Dr. Juan Carlos Z&#x000fa;&#x000f1;iga-Pfl&#x000fc;cker for providing OP9 cells, and Dr. Mark Kamps for providing the pGD-E2A-PBX1-N51S vector.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0130495.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
