Previous studies have revealed that host immune reaction to allogeneic transplants could be regulated by thymus transplantation. However, physiological thymus involution hinders the clinical application of these insights. Here, we report an efficient generation of thymic epithelial-like tissue derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and its potential to regulate immune reaction in allogeneic transplantation. We established an iPSC line which constitutively expresses mouse <italic>Foxn1</italic> gene and examined the effect of its expression during <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of thymic epithelial cells (TECs). We found that <italic>Foxn1</italic> expression enhances the differentiation induction of cells expressing TEC-related cell surface molecules along with upregulation of endogenous <italic>Foxn1</italic>. iPSC-derived TECs (iPSC-TECs) generated T cells in nude recipient mice after renal subcapsular transplantation. Moreover, iPSC-TEC transplantation to immuno-competent recipients significantly prolonged the survival of allogeneic skin. Our study provides a novel concept for allogeneic transplantation in the setting of regenerative medicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Stem-cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>Allotransplantation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The thymus is a crucial lymphoid organ for T-cell generation. During intrathymic development, T cells produce a vast receptor repertoire for defending individuals from invasive microorganisms or eliminating <italic>de novo</italic> malignant neoplasms. However, repertoire expansion also provides a potential cost for self-reactivity, which leads to autoimmune disorders. To prevent the release of auto-reactive T cells from the thymus, immature T cells encounter thymic antigen presenting cells (APCs), which express a wide spectrum of self-antigen-derived peptides combined with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This process allows elimination of auto-reactive T cells and also induces regulatory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Given that the thymus functions as a site of T-cell tolerance establishment, previous research attempted thymus transplantation to prevent immunological rejection in experimental transplantation models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Immune rejection is mainly mediated by T cells, and eliminating T cells themselves or preventing their activation contributes to prolonged survival of transplanted organs. Indeed, most currently available commercial immunosuppressants target T cells and inhibit their activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">There are several subsets of APCs in the thymus, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, or thymic epithelial cells (TECs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, thymic lobes transplanted without haematopoietic cells, but containing epithelial structure, tolerizes the host immune system to the thymus donor mouse strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These results suggest that intrathymic haematopoietic APCs are not necessary for establishing donor-specific unresponsiveness. Therefore, transplantation of thymic epithelium might be beneficial for preventing immune rejection. However, despite its therapeutic potential, thymus grafting to organ transplantation recipients has not reached clinical settings. This would be because of physiological involution of the thymus. The thymus has its maximum size and potential for T cell generation during childhood; its function decreases with aging. The degenerated thymus is typified by a reduced number of T cells and TECs; however, adipose tissues are broadly observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, considering that organ donors are usually adult individuals, physiological involution results in decreased thymus availability from organ donors. Even though it is possible to graft an aged thymus, there would be less ability to tolerize the recipient immune system.</p><p id="Par5">Pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs are expected to be an alternative source of grafts for transplantation.

We first focused on constructing a step-by-step protocol for induction of TECs through definitive endoderm (DE), anterior foregut endoderm (AFE), and pharyngeal endoderm (PE) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). DE is known to be induced by a high concentration of Activin and is defined by cell surface expression of Cxcr4, c-Kit, and EpCAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We established a protocol for DE induction by modifying several induction methods to optimize them for our iPS cell line (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis revealed highly overlapped expression of these marker molecules, suggesting efficient (c-Kit<sup>+</sup>Cxcr4<sup>+</sup> cells were 86.7%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.25) DE induction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Additionally, upregulation of DE marker genes, defined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), also indicated appropriate differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We also examined Foxa2 protein expression and found it to be primarily localized to the nucleus, whereas protein expression of Sox2, one of the key factors responsible for pluripotency, was not detected (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These results are consistent with the estimated efficiency determined by flow cytometry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Generation of iPSC-TECs.

The early anterior-posterior formation is regulated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling. Previously, screening multiple combinations of signal agonists and antagonists revealed that DE cells could be anteriorized by simultaneous inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF) and BMP signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. By culturing DE cells in the presence of these signal inhibitors, i.e., SB431542 and LDN193189, anterior marker genes were significantly upregulated, and immunofluorescence imaging showed merged expression of Sox2 with Foxa2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref>). Importantly, suppressed Sox2 expression at the DE stage was restored after the anteriorization process. To induce pharyngeal endoderm, anterior foregut endoderm cells were exposed to 6 factors to stimulate BMP, FGF, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, and retinoic acid (RA) signalling whilst under combinatory inhibition of TGF and the sonic hedgehog signalling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Physiological TEC differentiation is dependent on region-specific expression of forkhead box protein, Foxn1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Hence, we employed <italic>Foxn1</italic> as a key differentiation marker and quantified its expression on day 14. A small but significant increase in <italic>Foxn1</italic> expression indicated the existence of a TEC population in the obtained cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). We also analysed marker molecules on the cell surface by flow cytometry. TECs are categorized as an epithelial cell subset, and approximately 5% of obtained cells expressed epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). TECs are further classified into two subsets based on their surface expression of Ly51 and UEA-1, which are expressed by cortical and medullary TECs, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Flow cytometry analysis revealed minimal levels of these populations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>).

However, it is indicated by cell surface analysis that the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture condition promoted terminal differentiation without receiving signals from T cells. Notably, gene expression of delta-like 4 ligand (<italic>Dll4</italic>) was also determined by qPCR, and the results suggest the possibility of T-cell differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transduction of exogenous Foxn1 gene promotes iPSC-TEC differentiation</title><p id="Par10"><italic>Foxn1</italic> is known as a key transcription factor of thymus morphogenesis.

Although skin allograft rejection and antigen-specific T-cell clone deletion were previously investigated in PSC-TEC recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, our study demonstrates for the first time that iPSC-TECs contribute to allograft survival in immunocompetent mice.</p><p id="Par15">Previous studies aiming to generate thymic epithelium from PSCs showed successful differentiation from PSCs to TECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, the efficiency of the TEC differentiation was generally low, and Su <italic>et al</italic>. utilized a recombinant transcription factor, HOXA3, and FOXN1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. They demonstrated promotion of the differentiation efficiency and functional T-cell generation in nude mice. We induced exogenous <italic>Foxn1</italic> expression during iPSC differentiation that promoted <italic>in vitro</italic> TEC generation. This result suggests that <italic>Foxn1</italic> influences the fate of differentiating cells. Consistent with this, Bredenkamp <italic>et al</italic>. showed that enforced expression of <italic>Foxn1</italic> in mouse fibroblasts promotes TEC-like phenotype acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The induction efficiency of target cells varies depending on cell line, and protocols often need to be optimized for each cell line. Although it is difficult to exactly compare the utility of the TEC induction protocol with another mouse iPSC-TEC study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, enforcement of Foxn1 expression in iPSC may enhance differentiation efficiency, whichever protocol is used. Future studies are needed to extend our findings.</p><p id="Par16"><italic>Foxn1</italic> is also known to be expressed and function in hair follicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, we excluded the possibility of hair follicle cell generation by analysing ectodermal gene expression. Moreover, these types of genes were not detected in our differentiation protocol (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that the T-cell generating function was not simply due to phenotypic acquisition but also caused by successful differentiation toward TECs. Transplanted iPSC-TECs were only sufficient to generate a small number of T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. One of the possible reasons is that iPSC-TECs after isolation can survive for only a short period. The differentiation medium contains various supplements that may influence the cells&#x02019; demand for nutrients. Fine-tuning of medium supplements may be beneficial for sustained engraftment of iPSC-TECs. Another possible reason is that iPSC-TECs are not capable of efficiently recruiting immature T cells from peripheral circulation. Consistently, double-negative thymocytes mixed with iPSC-TECs differentiated into mature T cells within aggregates. iPSC-TECs expressed T-cell recruiting chemokine <italic>Ccl25</italic>; however, its protein level and secretion may not be effective for T-cell infiltration into iPSC-TEC aggregates.</p><p id="Par17">B6 iPSC-TECs significantly prolonged the survival of skin grafts from the B6 donor, specifically, albeit to a lesser extent. It could be reasoned that there is a hierarchy in the susceptibility of different allografts to rejection, and the skin is ranked as one of the most susceptible transplants&#x000a0;to rejection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thymus transplantation following appropriate pre-treatment reconstitutes the recipient&#x02019;s T-cell immune system. To establish immune tolerance against the thymus donor, T cells developed in the donor thymus would need to be dominant. It is supposed that donor thymus-derived T cells exist as a small proportion and could not convert the T-cell immune system to donor tolerant. Regulatory T cells also play significant roles in T-cell tolerance. Even in cases where those cells were generated through iPSC-TECs, their numbers were not sufficient to regulate anti-donor response. While we treated recipient mice with a T-cell depletion antibody and total body irradiation to modify their immune system to become similar to that of nude mice, there is an involved preconditioning regimen in addition to T-cell depletion (e.g., co-stimulatory molecule blockade). In addition, anti-recipient thymus treatment is also needed to precisely balance T-cell development. Treating recipient mice with another kind of conditioning method prior to iPSC-TEC or skin transplantation would facilitate allograft survival for even longer periods.</p><p id="Par18">Our research group has recently achieved the regulation of recipient immune response against PSC-derived allograft by the administration of PSC-derived immunoregulatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Although in several previous studies, thymus transplantation surmounted discordant allogeneic barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, this approach has still not reached the clinic. Our notion will provide a possibility for iPSCs to be an alternative source of thymus graft which is difficult to procure from a living or cadaveric donor.
