The aim of this study was to evaluate cellular immune responses (CIR) induced by an IL-18 binding protein gene (<italic>C12L</italic>) deleted vector (MVA&#x00394;C12L).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were immunized with different doses of MVA&#x00394;C12L or MVA wild type (MVAwt), then CIR to VACV epitopes in immunogenic proteins were evaluated in spleen and draining lymph nodes at acute and memory phases (7 and 40 days post-immunization respectively). Compared with parental MVAwt, MVA&#x00394;C12L immunization induced a significant increase of two to three-fold in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses to different VACV epitopes, with increased percentage of anti-VACV cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells (CD107a/b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) during the acute phase of the response. Importantly, the immunogenicity enhancement was also observed after MVA&#x00394;C12L inoculation with different viral doses and by distinct routes (systemic and mucosal). Potentiation of MVA's CIR was also observed during the memory phase, in correlation with a higher protection against an intranasal challenge with VACV WR. Of note, we could also show a significant increase in the CIR against HIV antigens such as Env, Gag, Pol and Nef from different subtypes expressed from two recombinants of MVA&#x00394;C12L during heterologous DNA prime/MVA boost vaccination regimens.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study demonstrates the relevance of IL-18 bp contribution in the immune response evasion during MVA infection.

During this process of attenuation, MVA underwent deletion of 31 kbp (15&#x00025;) of its genome, as compared to its parental strain, including a number of genes that contribute to viral evasion from host immune responses and that determine virus host range <xref rid="pone.0032220-Antoine1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Blanchard1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As a result, MVA lost its ability to replicate in most mammalian cells, including primary human cells <xref rid="pone.0032220-Sutter1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, MVA has conserved the characteristic ability to induce robust T-cell immune responses against recombinant antigens, comparable to those generated by more virulent replication competent VACV strains <xref rid="pone.0032220-Belyakov1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Earl1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Its safety as a vaccine vector has been largely proved during the vaccination of more than 100.000 individuals against smallpox without side effects <xref rid="pone.0032220-Stickl1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, the highly advantageous safety characteristics showed by MVA, in addition to its ability to express high levels and numbers of foreign genes, has converted it as one of the leading candidates for evaluation as a vaccine vector in multiple human clinical trials against different infection diseases <xref rid="pone.0032220-Mwau1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Moorthy1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-McShane1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and also melanoma <xref rid="pone.0032220-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Despite its large loss of genomic regions during the attenuation process, MVA still retains viral genes involved in host immune response evasion, raising the possibility to increase its vaccine potential by removing some of them. Examples of this test of concept have been recently shown in the literature, as the enhancement of MVA immunogenicity after the removal of the gene that encodes an interleukin 1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;)-binding protein that is secreted from infected cells <xref rid="pone.0032220-Staib1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; or the increment of its vaccine efficacy after the removal of the gene <italic>A41L</italic> that encodes for a chemokine-binding protein <xref rid="pone.0032220-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; or removal of the gene <italic>C6L</italic> that encodes an inhibitor of IFN-&#x003b2; induction <xref rid="pone.0032220-GarciaArriaza1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Another gene with immunomodulatory properties that has been conserved in the MVA genome is the <italic>008L</italic> gene (<italic>C12L</italic> in VACV) that codes for an interleukin 18 binding protein (IL-18 bp) <xref rid="pone.0032220-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Symons1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. IL-18 bps have been described in humans and mouse as soluble inhibitors that bind and neutralize endogenous IL-18 <xref rid="pone.0032220-Novick1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. IL-18 has important roles in the regulation of both innate and specific immune responses. This cytokine is an important mediator in the Th1 response, primarily by induction of IFN-&#x003b3; secretion from T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells <xref rid="pone.0032220-Dinarello1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, it also enhances T and NK cell maturation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0032220-Yoshimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Okamura1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Gracie1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, IL-12 and IL-18 act synergistically to promote Th1-mediated immune responses, which play a critical role in defense against intracellular microbes through the production of IFN-&#x003b3; <xref rid="pone.0032220-Yoshimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Past reports have firstly described that the orthopoxviruses VACV, ectromelia virus (EV), and cowpox virus express a soluble IL-18 bp (vIL-18 bp), encoded by homologs of the variola virus D7L ORF that is secreted from infected cells <xref rid="pone.0032220-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Born1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Expression of this immunomodulator by distinct poxvirus strains emphasizes the importance of IL-18 in the course of viral infections as immune evasion mechanisms. The <italic>C12L</italic> gene of the VACV Western Reserve (WR) strain was previously characterized in BALB/c mice. Results showed that after inoculation of mice by intranasal (i.n) route, a deletion mutant for this gene was attenuated and induced lower weight loss and signs of illness compared to controls <xref rid="pone.0032220-Symons1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Afterwards, the same authors performed a more in depth study in which they demonstrated a role for the vIL-18 bp in counteracting IL-18 in both the innate and the specific immune response to VACV infection, highlighting the ability of IL-18 to promote vigorous antiviral T-cell responses <xref rid="pone.0032220-Reading1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. A more recent study described the effects of the deletion of the IL-18 bp gene from the genome of another replicating VACV strain, the Tiantan Vaccinia virus (TV) vector, in which the deletion diminished the virulence of the parental virus while immunogenicity was not affected <xref rid="pone.0032220-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Although the studies in which the deletion of IL-18 bp coding gene from the VACV WR genome documented an improvement in the cellular immunity induced by the deletion mutant, in relation to the MVA attenuated strain, the only report performed until now in which the <italic>C12L</italic> gene was deleted from a MVA-BAC suggested that no improvements in the cellular immunogenicity could be made by the deletion of this gene <xref rid="pone.0032220-Cottingham1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we have done an in depth characterization of the immunological effects in mice after deleting the IL-18 bp coding gene from the MVA genome. We found that IL-18 bp contributes to immune response evasion during MVA infection, as the deletion enhances T-cell immune responses against vector antigens. Importantly, the deleted vector enhanced the immune response to HIV antigens expressed from recombinant vectors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1. In vitro characterization of a MVA deleted of the IL-18 bp gene: MVA&#x00394;C12L</title><p>To analyze the possible role of the <italic>C12L</italic> gene, codifying for IL-18 bp, during MVA infection, we constructed an MVA with a deletion in the <italic>C12L</italic> gene, following the methodology described under <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. To verify removal of the <italic>C12L</italic> viral gene we performed a PCR with DNA extracted from CEFs infected with parental or mutant virus (MVAwt or MVA&#x00394;C12L), using oligonucleotide primers specific for MVA genomic sequences adjacent to the IL-18 bp gene locus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g001">Figure 1A</xref> (left panel), shows an amplified band of nearly 1100 bp from the wild type template, whereas this band was absent in the PCR corresponding to MVA&#x00394;C12L. As an internal control, we performed a PCR amplification of another viral gene, the hemagglutinin gene (HA), that produced a band of nearly 900 bp which was present in both DNA templates. To directly verify the absence of <italic>C12L</italic> gene expression, RT-PCR with RNA extracted from CEFs infected with MVAwt or MVA&#x00394;C1L was performed. In the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, a 363 bp fragment specific for the IL-18 bp RNA was only present in the sample from CEFs infected with MVAwt. Previous reports demonstrated that the <italic>C12L</italic> gene was not essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of VACV employing the WR strain <xref rid="pone.0032220-Symons1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. But, as differences in both viral genetic background and in the generation process of the deleted mutant may affect the final virus obtained, we therefore considered important to evaluate the <italic>in vitro</italic> replication capacity of the generated MVA&#x00394;C12L mutant. In agreement with the previous report, the virus yields for both intracellular and extracellular virus measured in CEF cells were indistinguishable between parental and mutant virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Previous studies have shown IL-18 binding activity for different Vaccinia strains <xref rid="pone.0032220-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> including MVA, and that MVA expresses a soluble factor that inhibits the IL-12-induced production of IFN-&#x003b3; by mouse splenocytes <xref rid="pone.0032220-Symons1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, suggesting in an indirect form an IL-18 bp activity. Thus, our following aim was to evaluate the loss of function of IL-18 bp in the mutant virus demonstrating that MVA <italic>C12L</italic> gene encodes a protein with a biological activity directly correlated with IL-18. For this, a functional assay was conducted using supernatants of CEFs infected cells to analyze the ability of the C12L protein to inhibit the biological activity of mouse IL-18 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In this assay mouse recombinant IL-18 (rIL-18) was added to mouse splenocytes in the presence of supernatants from MVA infected CEFs and 24 hs later the levels of IFN-&#x003b3; secreted in the supernatants of the splenocyte cultures were measured by ELISA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows that preincubation of rIL-18 with supernatants from CEF infected with parental MVA triggered significant reduction of IL-18 biological activity, indicated by reduction in the induction of IFN-&#x003b3; by mouse splenocytes. The loss of function of this activity in MVA&#x00394;C12L was demonstrated by the fact that if rIL-18 was incubated with supernatants from CEFs infected with mutant MVA&#x00394;C12L, the inhibition observed was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0032220-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0032220.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>In vitro characterization of MVA&#x00394;C12L.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Corroboration of correct <italic>C12L</italic> gene deletion and abrogation of IL-18 bp expression.

To achieve this aim, we firstly analyzed the modulation effects induced after mice inoculation with a high dose of the virus (5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> pfu) by intraperitoneal (i.p) route. The specific cellular immune response was analyzed 7 days after inoculation, during the acute phase of the response. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g002">Figure 2</xref> describes the results found in BALB/c mice (H-2<sup>d</sup>). The specific anti-vector immunogenicity was evaluated against the Vaccinia E3 and F2(G) CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell epitopes previously defined. Both epitopes are located on proteins that are expressed early during virus infection <xref rid="pone.0032220-Tscharke1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, similarly to the IL-18 bp product which is expressed before viral DNA replication. Therefore, if the inhibition of the host IL-18 effect mediated by the viral IL-18 bp is causing a depression of the final anti-viral cellular immune response this would be expected to be reflected in the response against these epitopes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g002">Figure 2A</xref> (left panel) describes the specific cellular immune response (IFN-&#x003b3; secreting cells) against the E3 and F2(G) peptides found in the spleen of mice from both groups, where it is shown that for those MVA&#x00394;C12L inoculated, significant increments (p&#x0003c;0,01) (2 and 2,5 fold against E3 and F2(G) peptides respectively) were found.

Increments afforded by the MVA mutant against the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) were of nearly two-fold in the IFN-&#x003b3; secreting cells determined by Elispot after a restimulation period of 24 h, whereas extending this period to 72 h and quantifying levels of specific IFN-&#x003b3; secreted, the differences between both vectors were pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, increments of 2.5 (H3L) to 3 fold (L4R) in relation to MVAwt induced responses were observed. Moreover, in this model we also evaluated if MVA&#x00394;C12L modulated the cytotoxicity of the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> specific response, with the findings of a significant increase in B8R specific CD107a/b cells in those mice inoculated with the mutant MVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0032220-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0032220.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Immunogenicity of MVA&#x00394;C12L in C57BL/6 mice.</title><p>Groups of four C57BL/6 mice were i.p vaccinated with 5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> pfu of MVAwt (white bars) or MVA&#x00394;C12L (black bars) and seven dpi T-cell responses against VACV peptides B8R (CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-specific), E9L, H3L and L4R (CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-specific) were evaluated in the spleen.

MVA&#x00394;C12L elicits higher cellular responses at lower doses of immunization and by different immunization routes</title><p>The results of the experiments described above clearly showed that the deletion of the IL-18 bp codifying gene, produced beneficial effects on the immunogenicity generated by MVA. Those experiments were performed by inoculating mice with 5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> pfu, a somehow high viral dose, compared with the standard doses (10<sup>7</sup> pfu) employed in the majority of the MVA studies performed in mice and by i.p route. Thus, our following aim was to analyze if at lower doses of immunization and after application of the vector by other routes, the deletion of the IL-18 bp still had an improved effect on the MVA vaccine potential. In these experiments a five-fold lower viral dose was applied to BALB/c mice (10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mouse) by alternative routes, such as the intramuscular (i.m) and the intranasal (i.n) and, for comparison, we also evaluated the responses generated after this lower viral dose by the i.p route.

Analysis of the immune response generated by MVA&#x00394;C12L in local draining lymph nodes to the site of immunization</title><p>The primary adaptive immune response to most pathogens and vaccines is initiated in regional lymph nodes draining peripheral sites of antigen exposure. Lymph nodes are highly organized structures designed to efficiently transfer antigen transported from the periphery to node-resident cells specialized in acquiring, processing and presenting antigen to lymphocytes. It is uncertain how antiviral lymphocytes are activated in draining lymph nodes, the site where adaptive immune responses are initiated. Recent studies have demonstrated that na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells rapidly migrated to VACV-infected cells in the peripheral interfollicular region and then formed tight interactions with dendritic cells (DCs), leading to complete T-cell activation <xref rid="pone.0032220-Hickman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It was also shown how the administration route can target different APCs that differentially shape the virus-specific cell-mediated immune response of both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, in such a way that the accessibility of MVA antigens to different APCs at the site of immunization dictates the occurrence and extent of cellular immunity <xref rid="pone.0032220-Abadie1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, considering the importance that the draining lymph nodes (LNs) to the site of inoculation have in the final outcome of the immune response, our following goal was to analyze MVA-specific T-cell responses in the regional draining LNs after different immunization routes. Responses were evaluated in the inguinal LNs, (ILNs) after sub-cutaneous (s.c), and i.m inoculations and cervical LNs (CLNs) after i.n immunizations. For the three routes evaluated, we continued to observe differences between both MVAs, finding improved T-cell responses in those groups MVA&#x00394;C12L immunized. Importantly, we found that after s.c inoculation in BALB/c differences between both MVAs were incremented in the ILNs, resulting in a three-fold superior improvement of the responses against E3 and F2(G) peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Therefore, in line with previous reports we found that the final T-cell response was influenced by the APCs at the site of immunization, as differences between both vectors detected in the spleen, after administration by the i.p route with the same or even higher viral doses (1 to 5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mouse), were always nearly 2-fold. After i.n immunization, increments in the responses found in the CLNs of MVA&#x00394;C12L were nearly 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), following a similar pattern to that previously detected in the spleen for this mouse strain. In C57BL/6 mice we could also find in the draining ILNs an incremented response against both peptides analyzed (B8R and E9L) when MVA&#x00394;C12L was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0032220-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0032220.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Analysis of the immune response generated in local draining lymph nodes (LNs) to the site of immunization.</title><p>Groups of four mice were immunized as indicated in the bar charts with 10<sup>7</sup> pfu of MVAwt (white bars) or MVA&#x00394;C12L (black bars) and seven dpi specific T-cell responses against the indicated peptides were evaluated in the regional draining LNs to the different immunization routes as depicted in the Figure.

While these studies showed modest efficacy (31&#x00025;), they provide for the first time evidence of a candidate HIV vaccine capable of preventing HIV infection.

And more recently, it has been demonstrated that deletion of the viral IL-18 bp lessened the virulence of the Tiantan VACV strain in both mice and rabbit models <xref rid="pone.0032220-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It was previously reported that the MVA genome encoded an IL-18-binding activity <xref rid="pone.0032220-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Then, the first experiments performed in BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032220-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) indicated the importance of IL-18 modulation on MVA immunogenicity. Thus, mice infected with MVA&#x00394;C12L, and therefore in the absence of an inhibitory effect against host IL-18, generated responses against CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> epitopes of a higher magnitude, rendering two-fold increments in the number of specific IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 secreting cells against the E3 and F2(G) VACV peptides.</p><p>In C57BL/6 mice, these observations were corroborated, finding significant T-cell enhancements that reached three to four-fold increments against the immunodominant CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B8R peptide, and also a positive modulation against CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> epitopes. A critical function of the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells is their cytotoxic capacity, a parameter which directly correlates with protective anti-viral immunity. Importantly, we found that in both mouse strains BALB/c and C57BL/6, MVA&#x00394;C12L administration also improved the number of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells with cytotoxic properties (cells positive for the CD107a/b markers).

In relation with this, the relevance that the application of distinct routes of immunization could have on the final adaptive cellular response induced after MVA immunization was analyzed in a recent study <xref rid="pone.0032220-Abadie1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. It was found that MVA administration after i.d. or i.m routes target different APCs that differentially shape the virus-specific cell-mediated immune response. In the present study, the improved immunogenicity described for the MVA&#x00394;C12L mutant vector was corroborated after the inoculation of different viral doses (from 5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> to 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> pfu/mouse) and even more, this optimization was verified after i.p, i.m or i.n immunizations. In relation to the impact that the inoculation route could have on the final adaptive immune response generated, comparing the i.p vs the i.m routes, we found that after this last route a significant enhancement (of nearly 3 times) on the final magnitude of the specific responses detected in the spleen were observed against both peptides and in animals inoculated with MVA or MVA&#x00394;C12L. A possible explanation to the results obtained here may be differences in the principal types of APCs that are participating in the initiation of the immune response after i.p or i.m inoculation. Another factor that may be influencing the differences observed between the i.p and i.m routes, may be a differential pattern of the MVA viral gene expression. Therefore, previous studies have demonstrated higher levels of gene expression post-intramuscular inoculation than those recorded after i.p inoculation <xref rid="pone.0032220-Gomez3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Given the application of MVA as a vaccine vector, the observation that the beneficial immunogenicity effects after the deletion of the <italic>C12L</italic> gene were also observed during the memory phase is an issue of high relevance. Our results suggest the importance of IL-18 to induce and longer maintain the improvements induced in the anti-viral T-cell immune responses. Early exposure to distinct cytokines most commonly influences the balance between the development of short-lived, terminally differentiated effector cells and memory precursors CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells <xref rid="pone.0032220-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Beyond the induction phase, cytokines contribute to the regulation of the contraction of the response, as well as the long-term maintenance of memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells. It has been described that increasing the amount or duration of IL-12 stimulation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells results in elevated expression of the transcription factor T-bet (Tbx 21), which enforces an effector (CD127<sup>lo</sup>KLRG-1<sup>hi</sup>) phenotype <xref rid="pone.0032220-Joshi1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

Regarding the relevance of IL-18 in the promotion of T-cell memory responses, a recent paper indicated that a positive regulatory loop involving IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-18 signaling contributes to the accelerated memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell proliferation during a recall response to antigens presented by DCs <xref rid="pone.0032220-Iwai1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Although another study described that, despite the induction of IL-18-related genes during the contraction phase, they do not play major roles in regulating the dynamics or function of the T-cell response to <italic>Listeria Monocytogenes</italic> or VACV infection <xref rid="pone.0032220-Haring1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>The biological relevance of the immunization with the MVA&#x00394;C12L mutant was also evaluated by analyzing its efficacy in conferring protection against a challenge with the virulent VACV WR strain in the well established i.n challenge BALB/c model <xref rid="pone.0032220-Alcami1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In these experiments, mice were inoculated with low immunizing doses (2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> pfu, by i.p route), after which low levels of anti-VACV antibodies were induced <xref rid="pone.0032220-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, in order to have a window for a more direct correlation between T-cell immunity induced and protection afforded. But, it must be taken it into account that although low levels of anti-VACV antibodies are induced after that viral dose, possibly higher levels may be present in MVA&#x00394;C12L inoculated mice, as it was found in mice inoculated with 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mice (data not shown). The challenge experiments showed that mice that received MVA&#x00394;C12L presented an increased protection against the WR challenge at the memory T-cell phase, highlighting the improved protective capacity of the T-cell responses generated by the IL-18 bp deleted vector. Previous studies performed with other genes deleted MVA mutants also correlated the improvements on the cellular immunity with an enhancement in their protective capacity <xref rid="pone.0032220-Staib1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032220-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. To notice, this is the first study in which the <italic>C12L</italic> gene effects on the T-cell memory responses are analyzed, as in other previous works in which the <italic>C12L</italic> gene was characterized, immune responses were only studied during the early phase.</p><p>When we analyzed the vaccine potential of the MVA&#x00394;C12L with respect to recombinant expressed antigens, in particular HIV antigens, we applied the MVA dose as a booster in relation to the recombinant antigens (in a DNA/MVA scheme). We employed two MVA&#x00394;C12L recombinants one expressing a single HIV protein: NefBF <xref rid="pone.0032220-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and another one expressing a codon-optimized Env as a monomeric gp120 and a <italic>syn</italic> polyprotein Gag-Pol-Nef of HIV-1 from clade C <xref rid="pone.0032220-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Importantly, in both cases the delivery of the HIV antigens during the booster dose from the MVA&#x00394;C12L vectors generated an enhancement of the specific cellular response, and moreover the breadth of the HIV-responses was improved as positive T-cell responses against a wider spectrum of peptides were detected for both recombinants. For the NefBF antigen we have previously reported that after DNA/MVA immunization a low immunogenicity was detected against NefBF, which could be incremented if 3&#x000d7;DNA sequential immunizations were applied during priming <xref rid="pone.0032220-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. A fact to be denoted is that when the MVA&#x00394;C12L-NefBF was applied at boosting after the DNA priming doses, a significant increment in the response against Nef HIV was achieved, comparable to that found when three DNA priming doses were applied. A possible mechanism explaining why the absence of IL-18 bp viral activity at the moment of the MVA boost can mediate an enhancement of the DNA-primed HIV responses, may be the positive regulatory loop involving IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-18 signaling recently proposed to be contributing to the accelerated memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell proliferation during a recall response to antigens presented by DCs <xref rid="pone.0032220-Iwai1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, these results showed that the MVA <italic>008L</italic> (<italic>C12L</italic>) gene encodes for a protein with a clear biological activity that inhibits the action of IL-18, and that the deletion from its genome abolished this inhibitory activity. Analysis of the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of IL-18 bp after immunization with MVA&#x00394;C12L showed that at early times post-inoculation higher numbers of T CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> anti-VACV IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 secreting cells were generated. Importantly, we found that MVA&#x00394;C12L administration also improved the number of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells with cytotoxic properties. At later times post-immunization MVA inoculated mice still maintained higher CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell VACV-specific responses, which were correlated with an increased protection against an i.n WR challenge. Finally, in DNA prime/MVA boost regimes, the delivery of HIV antigens during the booster dose from a MVA&#x00394;C12L vector generated an enhancement of the T-cell response against the HIV proteins, improving the breadth, as significant responses against a wider spectrum of antigens were detected.

The presence of <italic>008L</italic> and <italic>165R</italic> (coding for viral hemagglutinin) genes were evidenced by the amplification of a 1060 or 948 bp fragments using the following pairs of primers: 008i1/008d2 and HA1/HA4 <xref rid="pone.0032220-Ferrer2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, respectively. In order to evaluate the transcription of <italic>008L</italic> gene a RT-PCR was performed. Briefly, BHK-21 cell monolayers were uninfected or infected with MVA (wt o MVA&#x00394;C12L) at moi of 1. Twenty-four hs post inoculation (hpi) cells were harvested and RNA was extracted using Trizol&#x000ae;, according to the manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen, CA, USA). RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and conserved at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until used. RNA was reverse-transcribed with the reverse transcriptase M-MLVRT (200 U, Promega) using random hexamers. The cDNA obtained was used to amplify by PCR a fragment of 363 bp corresponding to the complete coding sequence for IL-18 bp. Primers used were 008L-F <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;ATGAAAATCCTATTTCTCATCGC</named-content> and 008L-R <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; CTACTTCAGCCAAATATTCT</named-content>. To analyze kinetics of virus growth, CEFs monolayers grown in 60 mm tissue culture dishes were infected at 0.01 pfu/cell with MVAwt or MVA&#x00394;C12L. After 45 min of virus adsorption, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed twice and incubated with fresh medium plus 2&#x00025; of FBS. For each virus and time-point (0; 6; 12; 16; 20; 24; 36; 48 and 72 h post-infection) cells (intracellular virus) and supernatants (extracellular virus) were collected separately, frozen/thawed three times and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until virus titers were determined by visualization of lysis plaques on CEFs. Each time point was evaluated by duplicate and each fraction was tittered twice.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>5. Viral immunization stocks</title><p>Viral stocks were grown in BHK-21 cells (for MVA vectors) or BSC-40 cells (for VACV WR strain), viruses were released from the infected cells by several rounds of sonication, then purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and titrated by immunostaining <xref rid="pone.0032220-EarlPL1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> in BHK-21 cells using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against VACV antigens (for MVA) or by plaque formation in BSC-40 cells using crystal violet (for WR).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>6.

Briefly, cultures of CEF cells were infected with MVAwt or MVA&#x00394;C12L at 5 pfu per cell. Supernatants from infected cells were harvested one day post-infection (dpi), centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C and the pellet was discarded. Residual viral particles were removed by centrifugation at 16.500 rpm for 60 min at 4&#x000b0;C and supernatants were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until use. Then, splenocytes from BALB/c na&#x000ef;ve mice were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10&#x00025; FBS (RPMIc) with 200 ng/ml concanavalin A (Con A) and 5 ng/ml murine IL-18 for 24 hs at 37&#x000b0;C. To test for inhibition of IL-18 action by the C12L protein, recombinant murine IL-18 was pre-incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with clarified supernatants from CEF cells that had been infected with the viruses. Finally, levels of IFN-&#x003b3; in the culture medium were determined by a standard ELISA following the instruction of the manufacturer (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>7.

The protocol was approved by the Committee of Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the School of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires (Permit Number: 508/2009). Immunizations with viral vectors were given intraperitoneally (i.p) in 200 &#x000b5;l of PBS, intramusculary (i.m) in 200 &#x000b5;l of PBS (100 &#x000b5;l in each leg), subcutaneously (s.c) in 200 &#x000b5;l of PBS (100 &#x000b5;l in each leg, near to the groin region), or intranasally (i.n) in 20 &#x000b5;l of PBS (10 &#x000b5;l in each nasal fose). For DNA prime/MVA boost schemes, DNA doses were applied in 100 &#x000b5;l of sterile PBS by i.m route and 14 days after MVA boost was administered i.m or i.p. Doses and periods of time used in the different immunization schemes are depicted in the different Figures.
