Birds, which inhabit a wide spectrum of different habitat types, are particularly sensitive to and indicative of environmental changes. The Caucasus endemic bird area, part of which covers northeastern Turkey, is one of the world&#x02019;s key regions harboring a unique bird community threatened with habitat loss. More than 75% of all bird species native to Turkey have been recorded in this region, in particular along the Kars-I&#x0011f;d&#x00131;r migratory corridor, stopover, wintering and breeding sites along the Aras River, whose wetlands harbor at least 264 bird species. In this study, DNA barcoding technique was used for evaluating the genetic diversity of land bird species of Aras River Bird Paradise at the confluence of Aras River and I&#x0011f;d&#x00131;r Plains key biodiversity areas. Seventy three COI sequences from 33 common species and 26 different genera were newly generated and used along with 301 sequences that were retrieved from the Barcoding of Life Database (BOLD). Using the sequences obtained in this study, we made global phylogeographic comparisons to define four categories of species, based on barcoding suitability, intraspecific divergence and taxonomy. Our findings indicate that the landbird community of northeastern Turkey has a genetical signature mostly typical of northern Palearctic bird communities while harboring some unique variations. The study also provides a good example of how DNA barcoding can build upon its primary mission of species identification and use available data to integrate genetic variation investigated at the local scale into a global framework. However, the rich bird community of the Aras River wetlands is highly threatened with the imminent construction of the Tuzluca Dam by the government.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Bo&#x0011f;azi&#x000e7;i University Research Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>09S101 and 15Y00M7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilgin</surname><given-names>Ra&#x0015f;it</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors thank the Christensen Fund, the Whitley Fund, National Geographic Society, Kafkas University, and the University of Utah for funding our fieldwork.

Therefore, they are good indicator species for environmental monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Main causes of bird declines include habitat loss, exploitation (e.g. hunting), introduced species, and pollution [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with climate change rapidly becoming a major threat [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increasing temperatures also force many species to move to higher altitudes, reducing their ranges, particularly threatening tropical montane endemics and species of extensive lowlands [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>DNA sequences are significant sources of information for improving our understanding of the evolutionary and genetic relationships of organisms [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the last decade, DNA barcoding has become an increasingly important tool to catalog the diversity of life and to improve taxonomic classification. DNA barcoding is based on the notion that a short standardized sequence can differentiate the individuals of a species from those of other species because the sequence variation between species is assumed to be more than that within. The main objectives of DNA barcoding are to help the identification of unknown specimens, speed up the designation of distinct lineages, and improve the discovery of new species. Through DNA barcoding, a number of cryptic species, which were previously thought to be a single species, have also been discovered [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the other hand, there are some controversies about using single gene thresholds to discover new species especially considering recent divergences [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI, cox1) is frequently used for DNA barcoding in animals. Studies show that more than 95% of species possess unique COI barcode sequences, so species-level identifications can generally be done successfully [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In essence, DNA barcoding helps in the characterization of inter- and intraspecific genetic diversity, which is also important for determining species stability and for the conservation of distinct lineages. The genetically diverse but morphologically similar variants of cryptic species can be evaluated with COI barcodes, which helps in the potential discovery of new species or subspecies that might require conservation measures.</p><p>Until now, using DNA barcoding to document avian diversity has been limited primarily to North America, Korea, Argentina and Scandinavia [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The main objective of this study is to utilize the DNA barcoding technique for the first time for birds in Turkey. This approach will help the characterization of the genetic diversity of bird species in this under-studied region and make it possible to compare this diversity to the COI barcodes of the same species living in different parts of the world. Combined with the available DNA barcodes from Scandinavia, Russia and Korea, comparisons that include Turkey will provide a better overview of the distribution of avian genetic diversity in the Palearctic. This study is also an important first step in preparing a database of genetic diversity for the species in the region, and will provide the baseline data for monitoring changes in species and genetic diversity over time. As the study location at Aras River wetlands is a crucial breeding, wintering and migration stopover site for at least 264 bird species, our findings are important because they can demonstrate variation in the genetic composition of widely-distributed bird species. The documentation of genetic diversity at this site is also significant for bird conservation because the government of Turkey is planning to build the Tuzluca dam on the Aras River that threatens to destroy this vital area where most of the bird species of Turkey have been recorded [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was undertaken at the Aras River Bird Research and Education Center (Yukar&#x00131; &#x000c7;&#x00131;yr&#x00131;kl&#x00131;, Tuzluca, I&#x0011f;d&#x00131;r; elevation: 960 m; 40&#x000b0;07'16''N 43&#x000b0;35'00'' E), the first bird banding station in eastern Turkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g001">Fig 1</xref>). At the foot of the 1500&#x02013;2300 m high Kars plateau and surrounded by arid steppes of the I&#x0011f;d&#x00131;r plains, the Aras River wetlands comprise a major migration stop-over, breeding, and wintering area for many bird species travelling between Africa, Asia, and Europe. These wetlands are at the confluence of Aras River and I&#x0011f;d&#x00131;r Plains globally Important Bird Areas [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At the Aras River bird banding (ringing) station, over 75,000 individuals of 182 bird species have been banded and 264 species have been recorded since banding began in 2006, constituting 56% of the 473 bird species recorded from Turkey [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Birds were caught using 12 x 2.5 m Ecotone<sup>&#x02122;</sup> 1016 series mist nets designed for safe bird and bat sampling, with 16x16mm mesh made of D110 netting (DENIER 110/2) that capture birds without harming them. At the station, wetlands along the Aras River are sampled every year with mist nets, 40&#x02013;60 of which are open every day between mid-March to early June and mid-August to early November. Nets are checked every half hour, birds are taken out, brought to the processing center, identified, banded, measured, and released after the collection of the blood sample. The bird community of Aras River wetlands is mostly typical of eastern Europe and the species examined for this study are common and well-known European species that were identified by licensed and experienced bird banders, using detailed field guides and identification books when necessary [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154454.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For this study, the collection of the blood samples was conducted in May 2009 and October 2009. Aras station has operated approximately 150 to 200 days every year since 2006. The birds sampled for this study are representative of the bird community at the site. All but two of the species analyzed in this study are captured every year and are among the most common 70% of the species captured. The species diversity and abundance during these seasons was comparable to, and did not differ significantly from, species diversities and abundances from other seasons (t-test, p = 0.062&#x02013;0.83). Blood samples were collected following standard protocols. From the brachial vein of each bird, 20&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;l blood was collected with a 30-gauge needle. Blood collected from each bird was less than 0.2% of its body weight, five times below the recommended maximum. No birds were injured or ill during the capture, handling and blood collection.</p><fig id="pone.0154454.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0154454.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of the Aras River (Kars-I&#x0011f;d&#x00131;r) biodiversity region and Aras Bird Research and Education Center bird banding (ringing) station.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0154454.g001"/></fig><p>For extracting DNA from the blood samples, Roche High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Germany) and Invitrogen Pure Ink Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (USA) were used, and the manufacturer protocols were applied.

To be able to undertake these objectives using the DNA barcoding approach, a threshold is needed. This threshold should be high enough to separate specimens that belong to different species and low enough to recognize recently diverged species. Hebert et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] proposed a threshold to define new species, which he called the "barcoding gap", defined as ten times the mean intraspecific variation for the studied group. In this study, the mean intraspecific divergence was 0.62% for the samples analyzed, and the resulting barcoding gap of 6.2% is indeed less than the lowest observed interspecific distance of 6.8%. Hence, for the species in our study, the barcoding gap worked effectively. A distribution of intra- and interspecific divergence frequencies is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g002">Fig 2</xref>. A study on avian diversification showed that the average intraspecific distance was 0.32% for the Palearctic dataset [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], dropping to 0.19% if highly variable species are excluded. For the Aras samples, the exclusion of highly variable species dropped the average intraspecific distance to 0.30%. A study on North American birds [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] indicated that some species have deep intraspecific divergences that are 9- to 17-fold higher than the average distances, whereas the most divergent Aras samples had intraspecific divergence values 8-fold higher.</p><p>The patterns observed in the 33 species define four main groups. The first group consists of the seven species for which DNA barcodes did not uniquely define species. These likely represent cases of mitochondrial introgression between species, which has been previously documented in birds [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The DNA barcodes of <italic>Coturnix coturnix</italic> and <italic>Ficedula parva</italic> had high overlap with species that were previously recognized as their subspecies [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The DNA barcode of <italic>Coturnix coturnix</italic> had 97.94% similarity with that of <italic>Coturnix japonica</italic> and the DNA barcode of <italic>Ficedula parva</italic> had 94.52% similarity with that of <italic>Ficedula albicilla</italic>. Although we accepted <italic>Coturnix japonica</italic> as a distinct species in this study, there is disagreement about recognizing it as a distinct species [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Accepting <italic>Coturnix japonica</italic> as a distinct species meant that no intraspecific divergence was observed in <italic>Coturnix coturnix</italic> samples from Russia, Sweden, and Turkey. On the other hand, <italic>Ficedula parva</italic> samples had a mean intraspecific divergence of 1.6% as a result of the divergent South Korean samples. The <italic>Ficedula parva</italic> sample from South Korea clustered into the <italic>Ficedula albicilla</italic> clade. Since <italic>Ficedula albicilla</italic> is an Asian taxon and is still recognized as <italic>Ficedula parva albicilla</italic> by some authorities [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it is possible that the South Korean sample retrieved from the BOLD may actually be <italic>Ficedula albicilla</italic>, instead of <italic>Ficedula parva</italic>. Regardless, the non-overlapping distribution [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and large divergence of the eastern and western haplotypes suggest long-term isolation between these taxa.</p><p>Another member of the first group that was not suitable for barcoding is <italic>Cuculus canorus</italic>, since its DNA barcode had 99.53% similarity with that of <italic>Cuculus optatus</italic>. This species also had large intraspecific divergence, with a mean of 1.4%. <italic>Cuculus canorus</italic> is a brood parasite so lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species. Since cuckoos use different species as hosts, they evolve different gentes to mimic eggs of hosts. As a result, the risk of the eggs being rejected by the hosts is reduced. Gentes are restricted to female lineages; since males are genetically identical, the common cuckoo remains genetically as one species. Studies [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] show that there is differentiation between gentes in maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, but not in microsatellite loci of nuclear DNA. The causes of the shared mitochondrial haplotypes between these species are not yet determined and hybrids have never been documented [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>A different pattern in the first group was observed in the Emberizidae family and in <italic>Oenanthe hispanica</italic>. Sister species from Emberizidae family were phenotypically distinct but their mitochondrial DNA is similar [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The DNA barcodes of <italic>Emberiza citrinella</italic> and <italic>Emberiza leucocephalos</italic> showed 99.77% similarity with each other. These species breed across western and central Siberia, with <italic>Emberiza citrinella</italic> extending to Western Europe and <italic>Emberiza leucocephalos</italic> extending to the Far East. Although two species differ phenotypically, they become more similar across their sympatric ranges, which suggests that they could be hybridizing [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <italic>Emberiza hortulana</italic> and <italic>Emberiza caesia</italic> are also phenotypically distinct sister species with 99.2% similarity in the COI regions. There is no evidence for the hybridization of <italic>Emberiza hortulana</italic> and <italic>Emberiza caesia</italic> and their ranges hardly overlap [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The main reason for this similarity could again be introgression between the two species [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>A different example of the pattern observed in the first group is seen in <italic>Saxicola maurus</italic>, with its 99.35% DNA barcode similarity to <italic>Saxicola torquatus</italic>. This species had three different haplotypes, which are from three distinct geographical areas: Turkey, Central Asia and Eastern Asia. Although Turkey is not geographically in between Eastern and Central Asia, the Turkish haplotype was between the Asian haplotypes in the haplotype network. These three haplotypes may belong to three different subspecies since the ranges of subspecies were consistent with the ranges of haplotypes. In this case, the Turkish haplotype could represent <italic>Saxicola maurus armenicus</italic> since this subspecies is found in the mountains of eastern Turkey to Transcaucasia and Iran. Haplotypes from Central Asia possibly belong to <italic>Saxicola maurus maurus</italic> since this subspecies is found in East Russia to central Asia, and the third haplotype might be <italic>Saxicola maurus stejnegeri</italic>, with a range covering East Siberia to Japan and Korea. This pattern is parallel to that reported by Illera et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Zink et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in <italic>Saxicola</italic>, and corroborates their findings.</p><p>In group II, <italic>Acrocephalus palustris</italic>, <italic>Emberiza calandra</italic> and <italic>Saxicola rubetra</italic> had six, three and five haplotypes, respectively. Samples were from Turkey, Russia, Norway and Sweden. Although three new haplotypes were recorded for <italic>Acrocephalus palustris</italic>, all haplotypes were nearly identical. For <italic>Lanius minor</italic> and <italic>Merops apiaster</italic>, the different haplotypes had only two or three bp differences. This result confirms the absence of subspecies in these species, since there was no genetic divergence between the samples collected from different locations.</p><p>All members of group III have several subspecies, and these subspecies are generally defined according to the differences in morphology like size, bill size or plumage color. For instance, there are seven subspecies recognized for <italic>Alcedo atthis</italic>, and samples from Russia, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and South Korea were analyzed in this study. Although European and Korean samples belong to different subspecies, no significant intraspecific genetic variance was observed in the DNA barcodes. Other studies also confirm the absence of genetic variability between <italic>Alcedo atthis</italic> subspecies [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, there are five recognized subspecies for <italic>Sylvia atricapilla</italic>, seven for <italic>Muscicapa striata</italic>, nine for <italic>Passer montanus</italic>, 11 for <italic>Luscinia svecica</italic>, 15 for <italic>Turdus merula</italic>, 16 for <italic>Emberiza schoeniclus</italic>, and 37 for <italic>Galerida cristata</italic> (three of these subspecies, <italic>Galerida cristata caucasica</italic>, <italic>Galerida cristata subtaurica</italic>, and <italic>Galerida cristata zion</italic> are observed in Turkey [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Samples from an extensive area, including Russia, Turkey, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Sweden and Norway, were analyzed for these species. Although these countries cover the ranges of many subspecies, all COI sequences were nearly identical within each species. Haplotypes for each species differed by only one to eight bp. Since the subspecies of these species are mainly defined by color or size differentiation, the genetic similarity and the lack of genetic differentiation among these different subspecies is interesting, suggesting that phenotypic differences are not always reflected in differences in mtDNA. It should be noted that mtDNA goes through selective sweeps and bottlenecks frequently [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the lack of differentiation based on mtDNA alone does not necessarily mean a lack of evolutionary divergence.</p><p>A subset of the third group consists of <italic>Locustella luscinioides</italic> and <italic>Phylloscopus trochilus</italic>. Both of these species have three recognized subspecies. Four <italic>Locustella luscinioides</italic> samples from Turkey and Sweden were analyzed. Samples from Turkey (subspecies <italic>L</italic>. <italic>l</italic>. <italic>fusca</italic>), were differentiated from the Swedish samples (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>l</italic>. <italic>luscinioides</italic>). Similarly, the DNA barcode differentiation of <italic>Phylloscopus trochilus</italic> samples we analyzed was in concordance with the accepted subspecies designations. According to our study, samples from both countries had similar DNA barcodes.</p><p>In group III, the COI sequences for <italic>Passer domesticus</italic> samples from Russia, Turkey, Argentina, Norway, Kazakhstan, Canada, and Sweden analyzed in this study, a maximum of six base pair differences were observed, although 12 subspecies are recognized for this species. Being an introduced species might be the main reason behind the similarity in the DNA barcodes for the North American samples. Although the native range of the house sparrows contains most of Europe and Asia, this species is now found on every continent except Antarctica. Even though house sparrows exhibit broad phenotypic divergence in body mass, sexual dimorphism and metabolic rate in both their native and introduced ranges, DNA barcodes analyzed in this study and others are highly similar [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. DNA barcode for species such as <italic>Locustella luscinioides</italic> or <italic>Passer domesticus</italic> can distinguish them from other species, but are not useful for genetically diagnosing subspecies.</p><p>For another species in the third group, <italic>Cettia cetti</italic>, although three recognized subspecies exist, the analyzed samples from Russia and Turkey had identical DNA barcodes. These samples may belong to <italic>Cettia cetti orientalis</italic> or <italic>Cettia cetti cetti</italic>, since these subspecies are observed both in Turkey and Russia. Another species in group III, <italic>Coracias garrulus</italic> has two subspecies in its range. <italic>Coracias garrulous garrulus</italic> was found in North Africa, Europe to Iran and southwest Siberia and <italic>Coracias garrulus semenowi</italic> was found in Iraq to west Xinjiang and south Kazakhstan. Both subspecies winter in South Africa but in distinct locations [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For this species, samples from Russia, Turkey, Sweden, and Kazakhstan were analyzed. Again all samples had nearly identical COI sequences. In these cases, it was harder to state the absence of genetic divergence between subspecies, since all analyzed samples may belong to the same subspecies, and there was no previously available genetic data for different subspecies to use as a basis for diagnosis.</p><p>Also in the third group were species for which all the barcodes in the BOLD most likely came from a single subspecies. Both <italic>Oriolus oriolus</italic> and <italic>Sylvia nisoria</italic> have two subspecies in their ranges. For <italic>Oriolus oriolous</italic>, one of the subspecies is observed in the eastern part of its range from west Siberia to the Indian subcontinent, whereas the other occurs in the western portion, from Europe to the Ural Mountains. All samples that were analyzed in this study were from the western subspecies, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>o</italic>. <italic>oriolus</italic>. Similarly, for <italic>Remiz pendulinus</italic>, all samples analyzed in this study belonged to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>pendulinus</italic>. As expected, all analyzed DNA barcodes were very similar to each other for these species, as they represent samples from only one subspecies for each species examined.</p><p>All members of group IV had several genetically divergent subspecies with unique DNA barcodes. For both <italic>Caprimulgus europaeus</italic> (six subspecies) and <italic>Sylvia curruca</italic> (two subspecies), two main divergent and geographically isolated haplotype groups were observed. First haplotype group was common in the western parts of the species&#x02019; range, whereas the second group was common in the east. Therefore, these species exhibit an allopatric population system. Mean intraspecific divergences were 1.7% and 3.2% for <italic>Caprimulgus europaeus</italic> and <italic>Sylvia curruca</italic>, respectively.</p><p>In <italic>Erithacus rubecula</italic>, despite covering the ranges of different subspecies, there were only two haplotypes. The samples from Russia, Sweden, Turkey, and Norway were genetically different from the sample from Russia. The mean intraspecific divergence was 0.9%.</p><p>A different pattern in group IV was observed for <italic>Parus major</italic> and <italic>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</italic>. Three and two main different haplotype groups were observed for <italic>Parus major</italic> and <italic>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</italic>, respectively. These different haplotypes had overlapping ranges. Mean intraspecific divergence was 1.7% for <italic>Parus major</italic> and 2.6% for <italic>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</italic>. The most common haplotype of <italic>Parus major</italic> was widely distributed, and observed in Sweden, Norway, Russia, Lithuania, and the study site (Aras). According to Kvist et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], this observation supports a scenario of a recent range expansion, which can be explained by the confinement of this species to a single refugium during the Pleistocene. After the end of this period, the species spread to new habitats. For the case of <italic>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</italic>, genetic lineages appear to be largely sympatric [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], since there is a 26 base pair difference even among the Norwegian samples. Such a range overlap of two divergent clades might suggest the presence of two species, rather than subspecies, and detailed taxonomic evaluation of individuals from each clade might help elucidate the issue.</p><p>The first barcoding study of birds in Turkey showed that the bird community of Aras River wetlands, 1650 kilometers east of Bulgaria and 5 km west of Armenia, has mostly an eastern European-western Russian genetic signature, a result of its important location at the intersection of three major migratory flyways from western Palearctic to Middle East, India and Africa [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Even though our barcoding results mostly agreed with morphological/phenotypic species identifications, our findings from seven species in group I show that even for some &#x0201c;well-known&#x0201d; and morphologically distinct European bird species, molecular barcoding results may not agree with phenotypic species identifications based on morphology. The fact that molecular barcoding results in 21% (seven out of 33) well-known European bird species did not distinguish them sufficiently from similar species suggests that: 1-the genetic sequence used for molecular barcoding may not be diverse enough to accurately identify every species in a community; 2- hybridization, introgression, and shared mitochondrial haplotypes in some species limit the effectiveness of barcoding, and 3-barcoding data should not be relied upon exclusively for identifying bird species and need be interpreted in light of other genetic, morphological and vocal analyses, especially given that molecular barcoding is still evolving and many bird species have not been studied with this method. Especially in bird banding studies and other research that involves the capturing of birds, we recommend that tissue samples (ideally blood, if not at least feathers) are taken from every individual to be barcoded and the birds are morphologically identified to subspecies if possible. If this were done for every bird that is banded, every year we would be able to barcode millions of individuals of thousands of bird species. The resulting increase in our knowledge would tremendously improve our understanding of avian phylogenies, would reveal new cryptic bird species, and would help resolve much of the discrepancies currently observed between species identifications based on morphology and phenotypes versus molecular barcoding and genotypes.</p><p>DNA barcoding can also help to identify patterns of migratory connectivity for populations breeding in unstudied areas. Many of the species that pass through the Aras banding station are on their way to remote breeding grounds in Russia and Siberia. Because breeding ecology information from this area is so limited, DNA samples from en route migrants can be used to establish patterns of genetic similarity. The degree of genetic similarity can then be used to infer distinct breeding populations and migratory connectivity.</p><p>The gathering of the DNA barcoding data also made it possible to have a snapshot of the genetic diversity in the region before the possible building of the intended Tuzluca dam on the Aras River [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that would destroy this critical migratory stopover, breeding and wintering site if the efforts to stop the dam fail [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Turkey has already lost 1.3 million hectares of its wetlands since the 1950s and the recent dismantling of Turkey&#x02019;s environmental laws have [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] enabled the destruction of many remaining wetlands in the past decade. Over 75,000 birds from dozens of countries on three continents have been banded at Aras River wetlands and millions of birds likely use this riparian oasis. If constructed, the Tuzluca dam will wipe out vital habitat for this international bird community. The data collected in this study will also make it possible to document the impact of the Tuzluca dam on the genetic composition of the new bird community if Government Hydraulic Works (DSI) of Turkey ends up destroying the globally important Aras River Bird Paradise, home to at least 264 bird species at the confluence of three global migratory flyways [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the first barcoding study on Turkey&#x02019;s birds, we applied genetic barcoding to birds captured in the Aras River wetlands on the Kars-I&#x0011f;d&#x00131;r border, and compared our findings to the previous barcoding studies at continental scales. Our results generally agreed with the DNA barcoding literature both in terms of the effectiveness of COI barcodes as an identification tool and the existence of a barcoding gap [<xref rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Samples from five different orders, Passeriformes, Cuculiformes, Galliformes, Coraciiformes, and Caprimulgiformes were studied. From 12 species, 18 new haplotypes were recorded from the Aras samples. Unique barcodes/haplotypes were found in 26 of the 33 studied species. Four main groups were identified based on barcoding suitability, current subspecific classification and levels of intraspecific divergence at continental scales. Group I was composed of five species, which have no defined subspecies and no intraspecific divergence, and Group III consisted of five species which had designated subspecies with high intraspecific divergence. Hence these 10 species in groups I and III show concordance between subspecific taxonomic classifications and genetic differentiation. On the other hand, Group II had the greatest number of species in it, 16, which had taxonomically defined subspecies, but no corresponding intraspecific divergence. This suggests that in these species, at least some subspecific classifications are not supported by genetics and there might be over-splitting in their taxonomy. Finally in Group IV, we observed five species that had several genetically divergent subspecies with unique DNA barcodes. Our study shows how data from local scales and seemingly independent DNA barcoding studies can be used together to make phylogeographical comparisons at continental scales and taxonomical inferences. We recommend that this approach also be used with other groups of species that are barcoded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec006"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154454.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The locations for which COI Barcode Data were available from BOLD for Group I.</title><p>The black triangles indicate localities with GPS coordinates, the red circles indicate countries for which GPS data were not available, and the blue squares indicate the study site (Aras River Research Station).
