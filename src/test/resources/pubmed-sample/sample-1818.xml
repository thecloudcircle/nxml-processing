Here, we report the anti-tumor effect of a new antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivering a HDAC inhibitor to ErbB2+ solid tumors. Trastuzumab was partially reduced with tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP) and conjugated to ST7464AA1, the active form of the prodrug HDAC inhibitor ST7612AA1, through a maleimide-thiol linker to obtain the Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) ST8176AA1. The average drug/antibody ratio (DAR) was 4.5 as measured by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). Binding of ST8176AA1 to ErbB2 receptor and internalization in tumor cells were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cytofluorimetry, and High Content Screening (HCS) Imaging. The biological activity of the ADC was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by measuring cell proliferation/cell cycle, apoptosis/DNA damage, tubulin, and histone acetylation and modulation of Epithelial/Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers. Receptor binding and internalization of ST8176AA1 were confirmed to be similar to trastuzumab. Higher anti-tumor activity of ST8176AA1 compared to trastuzumab was observed <italic>in vitro</italic> in tumor cell lines. Such higher activity correlated with increased acetylation of histones and alfa-tubulin as a consequence of HDAC inhibitor-mediated epigenetic modulation that also induced increased expression of ErbB2 and estrogen receptor in triple negative breast cancer cells. Consistently with <italic>in vitro</italic> data, ST8176AA1 exhibited higher tumor growth inhibition than trastuzumab in xenograft models of ovary and colon carcinoma and in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of pancreatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor masses showed lower expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 and higher expression of cleaved caspase-3 in mice treated with the ADC compared to those treated with trastuzumab and results correlated with increased acetylation of both histones and tubulin. Collectively, present data indicate that ADC ST8176AA1 can target epigenetic modulation to ErbB2+ tumors. Interestingly, the amount of HDACi estimated to be delivered at the ST8176AA1 effective dose would correspond to ~1/1,000 of ST7612AA1 effective dose. Therefore, ST8176AA1 is an attractive new therapeutic candidate because it exhibits increased anti-tumor potency compared to trastuzumab by exerting epigenetic modulation at a much safer dose compared to standard HDACi-based therapeutic protocols.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ADC (antibody drug conjugate)</kwd><kwd>HDACi (Histone deacetylase inhibitor)</kwd><kwd>trastuzumab</kwd><kwd>ErbB2</kwd><kwd>solid tumors</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="21"/><word-count count="11175"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting receptors of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family, including anti-EGFR cetuximab and panitumumab and anti-ErbB2 trastuzumab and pertuzumab, are largely employed for cancer therapy in combination with other therapeutics. Antibodies contributed to improve clinical responses, patient quality of life and survival. Nevertheless, there is a growing awareness that in many cases antibody therapies are far from optimal, primarily because, like chemotherapeutics, they induce tumor cell resistance to inhibitory activities. Therefore, there is a need to increase the number of therapeutic antibodies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and there is a trend to harness them with additional anti-tumor features. The latter translated into clinical and commercial success of Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) including emtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg; Pfizer/Wyeth), ibrentuximab vedotin (Adcetris; Seattle Genetics), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla; Roche), inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa; Pfizer) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and recently approved recombinant immunotoxin moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk (Lumoxiti; Astra Zeneca) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and polatuzumab vedotin-piiq (Polivy; Roche) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It is to note that trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla) is the only one product approved for the treatment of solid tumors. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to ErbB2 growth factor receptor. It was first approved by FDA in 1998 and ever since employed widely worldwide for the treatment of primary and metastatic ErbB2+ breast and gastric cancer. Trastuzumab changed the treatment paradigm of breast cancer but it did not solve the problem of tumor resistance that, in turn, promoted its use in combination with chemo or with the second anti-ErbB2 antibody pertuzumab (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recently, trastuzumab was harnessed with highly cytotoxic properties by conjugating it to the cytoskeleton disrupting agent emtansine obtaining the ADC T-DM1. This product, as any other anti-cancer treatment, is also facing intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and significant side effects the latter related to the payload off-target toxicity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Overall, there is still a wide space for investigational activities aiming at improving the properties of trastuzumab.</p><p>Because epigenetic abnormalities are involved in the hallmarks of cancer, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have recently shown efficacy against both hematological and solid cancers. In particular, in cancer, decreased histone acetylation, as consequence of HDAC hyperactivity, leads to the repression of genes resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and malignancy. Moreover, during cancer progression, aberrant activity of HDACs leads to loss of cell adhesion, resulting in cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For these reasons, several HDACi drug candidates are being investigated and four have been approved for hematologic malignancies. Further strategies are being carried out to achieve dual molecular targeting, such as chimeric compounds that combine HDACi and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) moieties (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), as well as compounds acting simultaneously against Estrogen Receptors (ER) and HDACs, with the aim to modulate multiple cellular pathways and obtain higher efficacy compared to that of single-target drugs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>We recently described a new class of ADCs where the antibody cetuximab was charged with the low toxic HDAC inhibitor ST7612AA1 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Such ADCs, coded ST8154AA1 and ST8155AA1, are the first example of products targeting epigenetic modulation to tumors. ST7612AA1 is a pan-HDACi previously shown to exhibit anti-tumor activity against a variety of tumor models (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Despite efficacy, translation of ST7612AA1 into human therapeutic protocols is hampered by the risk of systemic side effects that are also observed with the previously approved HDACi vorinostat (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To be effective, this class of molecules must be administered daily at high dose thus exerting systemic epigenetic modulation ultimately leading to tolerability issues. Therefore, there is a need to improve tumor targeting of HDACi. We previously demonstrated that it is possible to use the anti-tumor antibody cetuximab to deliver an HDACi to EGFR+ tumors and these ADCs exhibited a better efficacy/toxicity ratio than either cetuximab or HDACi at their respective optimal doses (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we describe, for the first time, the generation and characterization of new ADCs, coded ST8176AA1 and ST8178AA1, where the active form of HDACi ST7612AA1 is linked to trastuzumab. The present work demonstrates in five animal studies, including two patient-derived pancreatic models, that the anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab can be improved by the conjugation to a safe and otherwise inactive dose of an epigenetic modulator moiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Synthesis and Characterization of ADCs</title><p>The chemical synthesis of the payloads was previously described (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

First, trastuzumab in PBS, pH 7.4, was partially reduced with 1 nM TCEP at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h, then the payload (20 mM in DMSO) was added to the reaction and the solution was left under shaking for 1 h at room temperature. The product was dialyzed to remove unreacted payload and analyzed by Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC).</p><p>The mobile phase A was 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 50 mM sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate pH 7.0/isopropanol (95:5 v/v). The mobile phase B was 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0/isopropanol (80:20 v/v). The analysis by HIC was performed on an UHPLC Ultimate 3000 (Dionex, now Thermo Fisher) using a column MabPac HIC-Butyl 100 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m (Thermo Fisher). The ADC ST8178AA1 was obtained by adding the payload to the antibody at 1:20 molar ratio. The resulting solution was left under shaking for 1 h at room temperature. The product was dialyzed to remove unreacted payload and the DAR was determined by MALDI mass spectrometry. Briefly, 1 &#x003bc;L of desalted trastuzumab or ADC ST8178AA1 was mixed with 1 &#x003bc;L of a saturated solution of s-DHB in 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile:water (50:50, v/v). The resulting mixture was spotted on the MALDI target and it was left to dry in the air. Then 1 &#x003bc;L of the matrix solution was added to each spot and it was left to dry again.</p><p>The mass spectra were acquired using an Ultraflex III (Bruker Daltonics, GmbH) in linear mode. A protein standard II mixture, from Bruker Daltonics, was used for calibration. The mass spectra were acquired over the mass range m/z 50&#x02013;180 kDa.</p><p>The DAR was calculated from the difference in molecular weight between the ADC and native trastuzumab. The gradient started with 85% of A and 15% B and it was hold constant for 1 min after injection. Then mobile phase B was increased at 100% in 25 min. The flow rate was 500 &#x003bc;L/min, the column was maintained at 27&#x000b0;C and 20 &#x003bc;L of each sample were injected into the column. Detection was carried out at 280 and 220 nm.</p><p>In the case of ADC ST8176AA1, the average DAR was calculated considering the area of the peaks shown in the chromatograms using the following formula:</p><disp-formula id="E1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mtable columnalign="left"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mover accent="false" class="mml-overline"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo accent="true">&#x000af;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover accentunder="false" accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover></mml:mstyle><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover accentunder="false" accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover></mml:mstyle><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula></sec><sec><title>ErbB2 Binding by Surface Plasmonic Resonance (SPR)</title><p>Binding kinetic constants by SPR were determined by using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare).

As of today, of the five marketed products, only Kadcyla is targeting solid tumors. Kadcyla is made of trastuzumab conjugated via a non-cleavable linker to the microtubule disrupting agent emtansine and it is approved for the treatment of metastatic ErbB2-expressing breast and gastric cancer. There are several factors affecting efficacy and tolerability of ADCs including antibody target relevance and binding properties, cellular uptake, release of the active moiety, and relevance of the targeted molecular pathway in the maintenance of tumor malignancy (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The role of the antibody appears to be particularly important, in fact ADCs made of two different antibodies targeting the same antigen (i.e., CD79b) and conjugated to the same toxin can exhibit different safety and efficacy profiles in patients (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Therefore, to investigate new ADCs, we decided to exploit well-known monoclonal antibodies like cetuximab and trastuzumab which are clinically validated having been used for decades for the treatment of solid tumors. We recently described ADCs made of cetuximab conjugated to a payload derived from the HDACi ST7612AA1 and exhibiting epigenetic modulation that induced anti-tumor activity (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Here we describe for the first time the ADC ST8176AA1 made of trastuzumab conjugated via a non-cleavable linker to the same HDACi moiety. Data show that ST8176AA1 substantially maintains the antigen recognition properties of trastuzumab both in terms of immunoreactivity and affinity. Superior anti-tumor activity of ST8176AA1, delivered parenterally to mice bearing tumor xenografts of human ovarian, colon or pancreas carcinoma has been demonstrated in comparison with trastuzumab. The <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor activity of ST8176AA1 correlated with the induction of epigenetic modulation in ErbB2+ tumor cells as measured both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by increased acetylation of histones and tubulin. Ovarian cancer is one of the most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths and chemotherapy remains the main option for its management (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network). Despite frequent preliminary responses to chemotherapy, this tumor often relapses, and limited alternative agents are currently available. Recently, investigational therapeutic strategies with biological agents such as antibody-drug conjugates have been added to chemotherapy (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In a recent clinical trial, mirvetuximab soravtansine targeting folate receptor alfa showed promising results in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Clinical efficacy in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer was also achieved with the combination of trastuzumab and abraxane in comparison with single drugs in terms of minor neutropenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). To treat ovarian cancer, epigenetic therapies have been recently proposed to counteract genetic abnormalities which are particularly frequent in this type of tumor (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Unfortunately, clinical trials with either a single epigenetic modulator or in combination with other drugs, have been disappointing for the appearance of drug-related toxicity inducing fatigue, vomiting and neutropenia (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Interestingly, the ADC ST8176AA1 here described appears to inhibit tumor growth without inducing toxicity and it could therefore be an attractive opportunity for patients with ErbB2+ ovarian cancer. In fact, treatment with ST8176AA1 induced neither body weight loss nor clinical signs or adverse events and at necropsy, no macroscopic alterations of organs were found. Moreover, in a recent paper, for the first time, HDAC2 was highlighted as a key factor regulating <italic>in vivo</italic> cancer growth and cancer stem cells (CSCs) phenotype involved in cancer initiation, progression and chemoresistance of osteosarcoma (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This observation is of particular interest because the HDACi moiety of ST8176AA1 is known to be also effective against the HDAC2 isoform (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The development of novel targeted therapies is also particularly needed for recurrent colon and pancreatic cancer. Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies such as panitumumab and cetuximab as single agents showed an activity in Kras wild-type colorectal cancer but presented limited benefits (1&#x02013;2 months) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Interestingly, ErbB2 activation is present in about 5% of colorectal cancers developing resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies thus supporting investigation of anti-ErbB2 antibodies and related ADCs in these patients (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported increased anti-tumor activity of ADCs ST8154AA4 and ST8155AA1 (cetuximab-HDACi) compared to cetuximab in EGFR+ tumor models including pancreatic carcinoma CAPAN-1 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Presently, we show the advantage of delivering HDACi to both ErbB2+ colon and pancreatic carcinomas by the ADC ST8176AA1. Present results with PDX models are particularly relevant because in these models the transplanted tumor is expected to maintain the original histology, molecular and biological properties of the patient's tumor (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and consequently, drug responses obtained from PDX mice are generally recognized as predictive of a therapeutic response in human patients (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In fact, clinical trials in which patients and related PDX mice were treated with the same drugs well-demonstrated to have parallel clinical responses (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). It is to note that ST8176AA1 appears to be an improved version of both trastuzumab and ST7612AA1 because it is shown to be effective in cases where trastuzumab is poorly if any active, by delivering an HDACi dose that is estimated to be several orders of magnitude lower than effective doses of the untargeted drug (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Clinical translation of this ADC might be facilitated because (a) extensive clinical knowledge of trastuzumab and (b) expected much higher tolerability compared to currently approved ADCs because of safety of the effector moiety.</p><p>Therefore, present results obtained with ST8176AA1 in PDX pancreas carcinoma are of particular relevance. EGFR family is an attractive target for pancreatic carcinoma since 40% of tumors overexpress EGFR and 20% ErbB2 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Moreover, the overexpression of these receptors was associated with worse outcomes and a therapeutic synergism between anti-ErbB2 therapy with anti-EGFR agents was also seen in pancreatic xenografts expressing moderate or low ErbB2 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Combination therapies could be highly efficacious but gastrointestinal toxicity is a key limiting factor as reported in studies with trametinib or erlotinib (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Genetic heterogeneity and plasticity of pancreatic tumor cells make unlikely to obtain significant and durable responses by addressing a single pathway (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), therefore the use of ST8176AA1 alone or combined with the cetuximab-HDACi could be an option worth testing. Present data also indicate for ST8176AA1 a possible use for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. In this clinical indication, neither trastuzumab nor T-DM1 are an option because of lack or insufficient expression of ErbB2. Our results clearly demonstrate that, even in the presence of very low ErbB2 expression, ST8176AA1-mediated epigenetic modulation leads to significant up-regulation of ER&#x003b1;, consistently with previous results obtained with HDACi (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Targeted epigenetic modulation could be an attractive approach to interfere with tumor malignancy and escape strategies. The possible use of HDACi has been recently postulated to up-regulate the expression of MHC class-I in protocols with immune check point inhibitors (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Moreover, epigenetic modulators could act as activators of potential multi-targeted drugs as recently postulated for the Sonic hedgehog signaling (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and supported by our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Overall, present results indicate that ST8176AA1 is a good drug candidate to deliver epigenetic modulation to tumors via the ErbB2 receptor. ST8176AA1 could be an alternative or a companion drug to T-DM1 for the treatment of ErbB2+ tumors and a unique therapeutic opportunity for triple negative breast cancer that might be inhibited by ST8176AA1 and also be made sensitive to tamoxifen standard therapies. Overall, ST8176AA1 compared to T-DM1 appears to exhibit two major advantages: (a) it is in principle applicable for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer; (b) it lacks the intrinsic toxicity of the T-DM1 payload which has been recently reported to be a binder of the cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 on human hepatocytes, a feature that explains off-target toxicity of the ADC in patients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that ErbB2+ tumors that include but are not limited to ovary, colon or pancreas could benefit from treatments with the ADC ST8176AA1 that, by inducing epigenetic modulation through trastuzumab-mediated delivery of an HDACi, can inhibit tumor cell growth. Interestingly, ST8176AA1 also induced ErbB2 and ER&#x003b1; expression in triple negative breast cancer cells thus possibly making this orphan tumor, sensitive to standard treatments. ST8176AA1 is expected to have an excellent tolerability lacking the intrinsic toxicity of the trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) payload and acting at HDACi dose order of magnitude lower than those generally used systemically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s9">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by OPBA Alfasigma SpA.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>FM, LV, AA, CC, AR, VC, MT, EC, VF, EP, GB, LS, and GG participated in the design of experiments and execution, data acquisition, and analysis.
