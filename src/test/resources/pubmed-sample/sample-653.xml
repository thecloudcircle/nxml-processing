BSM treatment caused significant decreases in the biomass, chlorophyll content, net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, photosystem II (PSII) maximum quantum yield, actual quantum yield, photochemical quenching coefficient, and electron transport rate in cucumber seedlings, but increased the minimal fluorescence yield and dark respiration rate. Moreover, comparisons of the patterns of absorbed light energy partitioning revealed that the fractions of excess and thermally dissipated energy increased with rising concentrations of the BSM residue, but the fraction of PSII photochemistry declined. The BSM residues caused reversible destruction in the PSII reaction centers and decreased the proportion of available excitation energy used in PSII photochemistry.

Bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) has been used since the 1970s and now is widely used in paddy fields in the world. In China, BSM was first used in paddy fields to control sedge and broadleaf weeds, and now it is also used to control broadleaf weeds in wheat fields [<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>As a sulfonylurea herbicide, BSM is principally absorbed by roots and leaves, and can inhibit acetolactate synthase and the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The herbicide shows high selectivity and has been used extensively for many years. However, its overutilization can have negative impacts on farming, such as damaging sensitive crops and creating herbicide-resistant weeds[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>BSM degradation occurs mainly through chemical hydrolysis and microbial processes in soil. Levels of soil organic matter and the soil pH affect the degradation of BSM[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, BSM may persist for a long period (over 100 d) when applied under specific climatic and/or soil conditions; it may be filtered into the environment and its residues may impair the rotation of other crops[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The safety interval of BSM is 90 d in the north and 80 d in the south of China. Herbicide persistence in soil influences the choice of herbicide because of rotational crop restrictions in the following growing season[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Chen reported that the BSM residue in the soil were 183.08 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> after treatment 84d[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The soil residues of sulfonylureas have injured rotational crops such as soybean, peanut, maize, rape, tobacco, sunflower, sugar beet, and dry beans [<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Different maize varieties have varying degrees of sensitivity to the BSM residue. BSM has a persistence of 150 d, and this high soil persistence combined with the sensitivity of certain crops have suggested that the risk of carryover on rotational crops is high[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the field of herbicide injury assessment, photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence are used to determine the degree of phytotoxicity of herbicides in plants, in addition to conventional methods such as morphological characteristics and yield measurements[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A previous study reported that imidazolinone may damage photosynthetic organs in rice before visible injury, lowering the crop&#x02019;s photosynthetic capabilities[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Tomar <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that the photosynthetic parameters of soybean significantly declined in the presence of anthracene.

The exposure of plants to herbicide residue induces many changes in morphological and physiological parameters. Herbicide residues are receiving increasing attention as they threaten crop yield and the safety of the environment, as well as human health[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A great deal of effort has been expended to solve these problems, such as detection of residues and biodegradation in soil[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Herbicide persistence can be a significant problem for producers due to injury to crops planted in succession or rotation[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We attempted to determine the photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of cucumber seedlings affected by the BSM residue in soil.</p><p>To alleviate weed hazards and change the unitary structure of weed communities, farmers often use vegetables and rice in rotations. There have been few reports on the phytotoxicity of BSM in vegetables during rotations of rice or wheat with vegetables. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the BSM residue on photosynthesis and growth in cucumber seedlings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Materials and BSM treatment</title><p>Soil samples were collected from an uncultivated area at the Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Xinxiang (35&#x000b0;18&#x02032;N, 113&#x000b0;52&#x02032;E), Henan Province, China, which have never been treated with herbicides.

Standard solutions were created from the stock solutions to produce solutions with concentrations of 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg of active ingredient (a.i.) per liter of BSM. Two hundred grams of each soil sample was placed into pots (70 mm tall and 83 mm in diameter) and 40 mL of the standard solution was added to the untreated soil. For the control, 40 mL distilled water was added to the untreated soil.

The R:S ratio in seedlings initially decreased and then increased with rising BSM concentrations. The BSM residue had a more pronounced effect on RDM than SDM at lower concentrations. As the BSM residue concentration increased, the growth of both above- and belowground parts of cucumber seedlings were severely suppressed. These results were consistent with the results of Su <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but inconsistent with those of Su <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Su <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that the inhibition of the root length of soybean and peanut were greater than those of plant height in the presence of BSM residue. This indicated that different crops responded differently to BSM residues. The reasean may be that at the lower concentrations, the critical threshold that the cucumber seedlings can tolerate has not yet been reached, so the BSM residue had a more pronounced effect on RDM than SDM. With the increase of the BSM residue concentration, it exceeds the critical threshold that the cucumber seedlings can tolerate, so the root and stem were significantly inhibited.</p><p>Abiotic stress factors such as high or low temperatures, strong or weak light intensity, and heavy metals are known to affect plant photosynthesis[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Photosynthetic pigments in plants absorb light energy and using it for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll content is directly related to the light energy conversion of photosynthesis. Some previous studies have suggested that pesticides significantly reduced the content of photosynthetic pigments and <italic>P</italic><sub>N</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In order to confirm the changes of photosynthesis caused by the BSM residue, we analyzed the <italic>P</italic><sub>N</sub> and other gas exchange parameters of cucumber seedlings under different concentration treatments. This induced a strong inhibition of net photosynthesis rate while reducing stomatal conductance, transpiration, and SPAD values. In contrast, <italic>R</italic><sub>D</sub> increased under the same conditions in cucumber seedlings. The leaf SPAD value was positively correlated with chlorophyll content[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These results showed that BSM treatment led to decreases in <italic>P</italic><sub>N</sub> and chlorophyll content, and the decline in chlorophyll content may also be one major reason for the reduction in <italic>P</italic><sub>N</sub>. The reduction in <italic>P</italic><sub>N</sub> and the rise in <italic>R</italic><sub>D</sub> in cucumber seedlings suggested that enhanced respiration may be a mechanism to reduce the damage to photosynthesis caused by BSM residue[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Our results clearly showed that BSM treatment caused significant decreases in F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>, &#x003a6;<sub>PSII</sub>, qP, and ETR in cucumber seedlings, but an increase in F<sub>o</sub>. F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> represents the primary light energy conversion efficiency of PSII. Previous studies have suggested that F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> is a sensitive indicator of photosynthesis in plants under stress, a measure of the maximum capacity of primary light capture, reflecting the potential maximum photosynthesis. Reduction of F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> indicated damage to an important portion of the PSII reaction center[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. &#x003a6;<sub>PSII</sub> and ETR decreased under BSM treatment mainly because BSM decreased the efficiency of excitation energy capture of open PSII reaction centers[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The decrease in qP suggested that BSM harmed PSII reaction centers and promoted the proportion of closed PSII reaction centers, probably generating a decrease in the proportion of available excitation energy used for photochemistry[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that F<sub>o</sub> is one of the criteria for estimating the number of antenna pigments of the PSII reaction center. The rise of F<sub>o</sub> suggested that BSM led to damage to PSII reaction centers. In general, changes in F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> can be used to diagnose whether photoinhibition occurs[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our results agreed with the finding of Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0215486.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] that fenoxaprop-P-ethyl caused a significant inhibition of PSII in <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic>.</p><p>With respect to the allocation of excitation energy absorbed in PSII antennae, there are three pathways for its consumption. First, D represents the fraction of excitation energy dissipated in the PSII antennae, and was much larger in BSM-treated than control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215486.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Second, P represents the fraction of excitation energy utilized for photosynthetic electron transport, and was much lower in BSM-treated than control plants, consistent with impaired electron transport in BSM-treated plants. Third, E represents the fraction of excitation energy neither dissipated in PSII antennae nor employed for photosynthetic electron transport, and this slightly rose in BSM-treated plants. The increase in E may lead to de-excitation of chlorophyll in the least desirable path, potentially resulting in damaging singlet oxygen formation, which could damage thylakoid membrane components. The damage to PSII reaction centers in BSM-treated plants was indicated by the decrease in F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215486.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p><p>Cucumber seedlings were negatively affected by the BSM residue in soil. When the residue of bensulfuron-methyl in soil exceeded 50 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>, the growth and photosynthetic capacity of cucumber was significantly inhibited. The BSM residue caused decreased photosynthesis, severely reduced plant height, root length, SDM, RDM, and TDM. Rice or wheat fields sprayed with BSM are not suitable for planting cucumbers in succession or rotation. Our results will provide the theoretical guidance for cucumber production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215486.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>This is the raw data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215486.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0215486.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>XY</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>YY</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>QL</given-names></name>. <article-title>Biodegradation of bensulfuron-methyl and its effect on bacterial community in paddy soils</article-title>. <source>Ecotoxicology</source>. <year>2012</year>; <volume>21</volume>(<issue>5</issue>): <fpage>1281</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>1290</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s10646-012-0882-7</pub-id>
