This has potential implications due to their widespread use in drug response experiments and studies of genomic function. One approach to optimizing the design of such cell line studies is to identify and use the cell lines that faithfully recapitulate critical features of primary tumors. To evaluate the epigenetic fidelity of breast cancer cell lines in the context of primary tumors, we performed methylation profiling of 55 well-characterized breast cancer cell lines on the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip platform, and compared them to publicly available methylation profiles of primary breast tumors. We found that the DNA methylation profiles of breast cancer cell lines largely retain the features that characterize primary tumors, although there are crucial differences as well. We describe these similarities and differences between primary tumors and breast cancer cell lines in detail, and develop a quantitative measure of similarity that is used to score each cell line with respect to how faithfully its methylation profile mirrors that of primary tumors.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (SPORE Program in Breast Cancer, P50 CA 88843), and the Department of Defense (COE: W81XWH-04-1-0595) to SS; by National Institutes of Health grants (P50 CA 58207, P30 CA 82103, U54 CA 112970, U24 CA 126477), and by the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute (5P30CA069533-16), and by the Susan G.

On the other hand, tumor cells may undergo dramatic genetic and epigenetic changes during establishment in culture as cell lines, and continue to do so in serial passages, potentially resulting in cell lines that show limited resemblance to the primary tumors from which they were derived <xref rid="pone.0105545-Maitra1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105545-Hampton1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The success of recent studies using the COXEN approach <xref rid="pone.0105545-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> to translate markers of drug response from cell lines to primary tumors <xref rid="pone.0105545-Ferriss1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105545-Havaleshko1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> highlights both the risks and the rewards of using cell line models of cancer. These studies successfully stratified responders and non-responders to several drugs in a variety of tumor types using marker signatures derived from experiments on cell lines. The success of this strategy could be attributed to the fact that the candidate markers had been carefully selected to determine which ones had expression concordant to that of primary tumors <xref rid="pone.0105545-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, understanding the ways in which cell lines are similar to primary tumors is a prerequisite to the optimal design of pre-clinical cell line studies. This knowledge makes it possible to determine which genes faithfully recapitulate the most important features of primary tumors, while avoiding cell lines that appear to have evolved significantly and have diverged in some critical features relevant to a particular study.</p><p>Several studies have documented similarities and differences between breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors at the level of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0105545-Neve1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105545-Kao1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, DNA copy number <xref rid="pone.0105545-Neve1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and in response to therapy <xref rid="pone.0105545-Heiser1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This is the first comprehensive comparison of breast cell lines and primary tumors using DNA methylation profiles.</p><p>Tumor suppressor gene expression is frequently transcriptionally down-regulated by DNA hyper-methylation of the gene promoter region <xref rid="pone.0105545-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105545-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. DNA methylation changes are stable and inheritable, but unlike mutations and copy number alterations in the genetic code, they are potentially reversible <xref rid="pone.0105545-Baylin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105545-Taberlay1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Epigenetic characterization of tumor cell lines could contribute to their use as models of in vivo processes such as drug response, and the comparison of their methylation signatures with those of patient tumors can provide guidance for their appropriate selection and use. Since the tumors of origin are no longer available in most cases, we have used publicly available data on breast cancer DNA methylation profiles as reference for this study.</p><p>A number of publications recently reported methylation profiles of primary breast tumors, including Dedeurwaerder et al. <xref rid="pone.0105545-Dedeurwaerder1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, Fackler et al. <xref rid="pone.0105545-Fackler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, Fang et al. <xref rid="pone.0105545-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and the collaborative effort reported by the TCGA consortium <xref rid="pone.0105545-TCGARN1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition to DNA methylation profiles, all four studies reported immunohistochemical markers (ER, PR and HER2). Gene expression measurements were also reported for all TCGA samples and for a subset of the samples from the Dedeurwaerder study <xref rid="pone.0105545-Dedeurwaerder1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although each of these studies has a specific focus and reports unique results, there was also a clear consensus on several key findings. All four of these studies observed distinct methylation profiles associated with ER status, and noted that ER+ tumors generally have higher overall levels of promoter DNA methylation than ER- tumors. Additionally, Fang and TCGA both reported distinct breast cancer CpG-island hyper-methylator or B-CIMP phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0105545-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105545-TCGARN1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and both Dedeurwaerder and TCGA reported distinctive tumor subtypes based on methylation profiles <xref rid="pone.0105545-Dedeurwaerder1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105545-TCGARN1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

It is unique not only for its size, including 55 cell lines, which are compared to methylation profiles from 561 primary tumors from 4 published studies, but also for the depth of the comparison to primary tumors. We comprehensively evaluated DNA methylation profiles of breast cancer cell lines in comparison to primary tumors to assess the extent to which the cell line model represents tumor DNA methylation patterns.</p><p>A careful analysis of this question is critical to the design and interpretation of any study exploring drug response experiments and studies of genomic function in cancer cell lines. Tumor cells undergo significant genetic and epigenetic changes during establishment, and in later serial passages that may span decades in some instances, so that commonly used cell lines may bear little resemblance to the primary tumors from which they were derived. There is, nevertheless, no doubt that cell lines have provided valuable screening tools for drug discovery as well as the study of molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer since the time they were first established as tumor models. As described in this paper, we find that, with some noteworthy exceptions, the DNA methylation profiles of breast cancer cell lines largely retain the features that characterize primary tumors. We have developed a quantitative measure of similarity that we use to score each cell line with respect to how faithfully its methylation profile mirrors those of primary tumors. This process led to the identification of a distinctive set of ER- breast cancer cell lines that share an unusual set of luminal-like molecular features that are rarely, if ever, found in primary tumors. This finding is, however, consistent with the hypothesis that the B-CIMP phenotype overlaps an in vitro adaptation signature. The same set of cells frequently fall into Dedeurwaerder subtype 4, which is strongly associated with ER+ phenotype in primary tumors, and most of these cell lines are also predicted to be ER+ using the Fackler methylation signature of ER status, albeit not by IHC. These luminal-like, B-CIMP positive ER- cell lines represent an intriguing class that appear over-represented in cell line collections. More generally, in primary tumors, a large proportion of ER- samples show no systematic methylation in B-CIMP-associated loci, whereas every ER- cell line shows moderate to high methylation at many of these probes, although only about half were classified as B-CIMP-positive. Significantly, in spite of its poor match to primary tumors, this ER-/CIMP+ group contains some of the best known and widely used breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-468, BT20, and MDA-MB-231. For some of these cell lines, it is possible that extensive passaging has contributed to the distinctive methylation profiles seen. In some cases, a cell line may be uniquely useful in research because unusual molecular characteristics render it highly responsive to perturbation, but in the absence of tumors showing comparable characteristics, due diligence would require consideration of additional tumor models to ensure that any conclusions could apply clinically.</p><p>Similarly, an additional noteworthy finding of this analysis is the complete lack of ER+/CIMP- cell lines, although this phenotype is well represented in tumor samples; accompanied by a reciprocal lack of a tumor phenotype corresponding to the above mentioned ER-/CIMP+ cell line phenotype. Notably, in the primary tumor datasets, the ER+/CIMP- phenotype is associated with Dedeurwaerder classes 5 and 6, which largely correspond to luminal expression subtypes, and which are both very rare in the large collection of cell lines examined in this study. This observation, seen in cell lines derived largely from metastatic tumors, is in sharp contrast to Fang's finding that the B-CIMP phenotype in ER+ tumors decreases the risk for metastasis. Our results suggest that luminal type tumor cells, with generally less prominent cell proliferation markers and higher overall methylation levels, may adapt to life in vitro by expressing or re-expressing B-CIMP markers. These findings support the view that the B-CIMP phenotype may represent or overlap an in vitro adaptation signature.</p><p>One would expect similar discrepancies between tumor tissue and established cancer cell lines in additional genomic assessments, such as non-transcribed RNA profiles or DNA copy number analyses, underlining the importance of verifying the clinical relevance of cell-line based investigative models against representative tissue data such as that provided by the TCGA.</p><p>In conclusion, the fact that methylation profiles of breast cancer cell lines largely retain the features that characterize primary tumors, a finding that is encouraging for cell-line based research models. This is particularly notable for the methylome, since it is subject to environmental and other influences than can modify DNA methylation states and might be expected to be less stable than structural evolution at the DNA sequence level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105545.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
