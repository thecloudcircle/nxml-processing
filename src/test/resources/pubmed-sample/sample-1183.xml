Moringa seed pods and leaves are widely used as vegetables or diet supplements due to the high nutrition value. However, no bioactivity-guided anti-adipogenic study was previously conducted. Therefore, a preadipocyte cell line was adopted as the bioactivity assay to identify the anti-adipogenic compounds in the peeled Moringa seed. Two known sulphur-containing compounds (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>) were isolated and identified. Compound <bold>2</bold>, 4-(&#x003b1;-<sc>l</sc>-rhamnosyloxy) benzyl isothiocyanate, showed a great anti-adipogneic effect with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 9.2 &#x003bc;g/mL. The isothiocyanate (ITC) group in compound <bold>2</bold> could be responsible for the inhibitory activity. In addition, a series of compounds with the ITC group were used to further investigate the structure-activity relationship, indicating foods containing ITC derivatives have the potential of being used to control weight.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anti-adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>isothiocyanates</kwd><kwd>Moringa seed</kwd><kwd>structure-activity relationship</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-25-02504"><title>1.

Treatments of increasing physical activities and reducing calorie intake are always recommended, and pharmacologic treatment is recommended as a more aggressive way for people who fail to respond to lifestyle interventions [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Five anti-obesity medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but studies have demonstrated the side effects of these medications [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Moringa seeds and leaves contain high levels of nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibres, so they have been used as food sources or dietary supplements. In addition, in some areas, Moringa seeds and leaves are consumed to combat malnutrition in particular iron deficiency [<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Extracts from the leaves or seeds were reported to show health benefits such as cholesterol-lowering, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-hyperlipidaemic effects [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moringa has been cultivated worldwide as a great commercial crop with fast-growing capacity, easy plantation management, and especially, of nutritive or medicinal value [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, this study focused on the chemical composition of the Moringa seed with the anti-adipogenic activity. In the present study, the pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cell line, which has the fibroblast-like morphology, has been employed as a bioactivity-guided model combined with analytical techniques (i.e., NMR and LC-MS) to isolate and identify anti-adipogenic compounds from the Moringa seed. In addition, structure-activity relationships were explored. The hypothesis of this study is that some compounds in the Moringa seed are able to inhibit lipid accumulation from preventing adipogenesis, and some specific chemical groups could influence the anti-adipogenic activity. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-25-02504"><title>2.

Bioactivity-Guided Isolation of Potential Anti-Adipogenic Compounds from Moringa Seeds </title><p>In order to obtain anti-adipogenic compounds from Moringa seeds, each fraction isolated from MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O extracts was screened for potential anti-adipogenic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The active fractions were selected for further isolation. The water layer was subjected to a resin column (SP70) to obtain different fractions, and only fraction 5 (Fr. 5) was active. This fraction was further separated into three parts (Fr.5a&#x02013;Fr.5c) using a semi-preparative HPLC.

Anti-Adipogenic Effects of Purified Compounds </title><p>Both of the isolates (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>) were evaluated by measuring the inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Compound <bold>1</bold> showed no obvious anti-adipogenic activity against 3T3-L1 cells at the concentration of 100 &#x003bc;g/mL. After being differentiated, the intracellular lipid accumulation was significantly inhibited by compound <bold>2</bold> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-02504">Table S2</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> value for the anti-adipogenic ability of compound <bold>2</bold> was 9.2 &#x003bc;g/mL (equal to 29.6 &#x003bc;M) without cytotoxicity, which was better than that of the positive control (quercetin). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f003">Figure 3</xref>, both compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> shared the same skeleton with the benzene ring and glycoside part. The only difference was the presence of an isothiocyanate group in compound <bold>2</bold>, which played a vital role in the anti-adipogenic effect towards 3T3-L1 cells. Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC, compound <bold>9</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f005">Figure 5</xref>), an aryl-ITC obtained from papaya with a similar structure to compound <bold>2</bold>, has been found to restrain body weight gain and liver fat accumulation in high-fat diet-induced mice [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

However, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, compound <bold>5</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f005">Figure 5</xref>), has indicated a much weaker effect on the lipid accumulation compared to that of the BITC reported in the same study [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to the isothiocyanate group, the anti-adipogenic effect of ITC is closely related to other types of structural group, which has never reported before and are discussed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-25-02504"><title>2.4. Structure-Activity Relationship of Isothiocyanate (ITC) Derivatives</title><p>In order to illustrate the structure-activity relationship of ITC derivatives, a series of compounds with the ITC group were purchased and employed to make a comparative study on their anti-adipogenic effect using 3T3-L1 cells. The structures of the ITC derivatives were divided into three groups, alkyl or allyl ITC derivatives (compound <bold>3</bold>&#x02013;<bold>5</bold>), aryl ITC derivatives (<bold>6</bold>&#x02013;<bold>8</bold>), and arylalkyl ITC derivatives (<bold>9</bold>&#x02013;<bold>11</bold>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The anti-adipogenic effect activity of all ITC derivatives, including isolated compound <bold>2</bold> is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02504-f006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-02504">Table S3</xref>. Quercetin, a commercial anti-obesity flavonoid, was also tested for its anti-adipogenic effect as a positive control. Of the alkyl or allyl ITC group, only compound <bold>5,</bold> with the allyl ITC group, revealed anti-adipogenic activity at a concentration of 60 &#x003bc;M, while other compounds with alkyl ITC group (compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) were inactive, which suggested that the double bond attached to the ITC group was important for the anti-adipogenic activity. None of the aryl ITC derivatives (<bold>6</bold>&#x02013;<bold>8</bold>) was effective at the concentration of 60 &#x003bc;M. Arylalkyl ITC derivatives, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>9</bold>, and <bold>10</bold>, showed significant anti-adipogenic activity. In contrast, compound <bold>11,</bold> with an additional hydroxyl group to the arylalkyl ITC, showed no inhibitory activity of lipid accumulation. Amongst those active arylalkyl ITC derivatives, compound <bold>10</bold> showed the highest effect, indicating longer alkyl chain between the ITC group and benzene ring could enable a positive contribution to their anti-adipogenic activity. Although compound <bold>2</bold> shared the same skeleton as <bold>11</bold>, the activity of those compounds was the opposite. The only difference between those compounds are at the para-position, the benzene ring of compound <bold>2</bold> is connected with rhamnose, while in compound <bold>11</bold> there is a hydroxyl group instead. A hydroxyl group could donate more electron density, which somehow negatively affected the anti-adipogenic activity of compound <bold>11.</bold> In other words, due to the presence of electrophilic aromatic directing groups, the more electron density donated by them, the less anti-adipogenic activity could be observed. Compounds <bold>9</bold> and <bold>10</bold> without the electron donation groups showed better anti-adipogenic activity than that of compound <bold>2</bold>. Therefore, the electron donation effect might decrease the anti-adipogenic activity of arylalkyl ITC derivatives.</p><p>In addition, previous studies have indicated that transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1)-activating potency could be triggered by most of the ITCs, indicating a very slight contribution of other functional groups to the TRPA1-activating ability [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the length of the side or so-called alkyl chains of ITCs had demonstrated a vital role in their bioactivities. Longer alkyl chain derivatives exert steric effects on antifungal activity of ITCs against <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> but enhancement on their antibacterial activity against <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> due to the increased hydrophobicity [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As for arylalkyl ITC derivatives, increased alkyl chain length has enhanced the inhibition of an arylalkyl isothiocyanate against nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)lung tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which to some extent is in agreement with our conclusion for the anti-adipogenic activity of arylalkyl ITC derivatives. Further work has revealed that high lipophilicity and low reactivity of ITCs might be of importance for the inhibitory activity against NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis. As for the alkyl isothiocyanates, longer alkyl chain could increase the activity for reducing tumor multiplicity. For example, dodecyl isothiocyanates are more active than hexyl isothiocyanates. In this case, the phenyl moiety is not essential for the inhibitory activity against lung tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, the bioactivities of the ITCs derivatives with electron-donating groups have been reported. Compared to &#x0201c;electron-donating group free&#x0201d; phenyl ITC, a decrease in free radical scavenging ability was observed in aryl ITCs bearing the electron-donating groups [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, compared with methyl ITC, an electron donating group to &#x003b1;-carbon (R &#x000b1; CX1X2 &#x000b1; NCS) significantly enhanced the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, an important enzyme involved in the cellular detoxification of genotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-02504" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-25-02504"><title>3.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the structure-activity relationship between ITC derivatives and anti-adipogenic activity have been investigated, which provides the potential perspectives of using food or herbs containing compounds with ITC group to control weight and possible chemistry mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Sample Availability:</bold> Samples of the compounds are not available from the authors.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-molecules-25-02504"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online: Table S1 Effect of each fraction isolated from Moringa Oleifera seeds on lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation.
