They run lateral to and slightly anterior to the posterior cranial fossa to the nasopharyngeal carotid space. Besides the hypoglossal nerve, the canal also contains an ample venous plexus, a small variable emissary vein, a branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery, and sometimes a persistent hypoglossal artery [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118317.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The hypoglossal nerve is formed by 12&#x02013;16 rootlets that emerge from the preolivary sulcus and usually divide into two trunks that may or may not unite as they traverse the hypoglossal canal. Nonunited trunks may travel separately through a septated hypoglossal canal [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hauser et al. classified the hypoglossal canal into 5 variations using bone specimens as follows: Type 1: No traces of division. Simple canal. Type 2: Traces of division. One osseous spur expressed either marginally at the inner or outer orifice of the canal or inside it. Type 3: Traces of division. Two or more osseous spurs expressed anywhere along the canal. Type 4: Complete osseous hypoglossal bridging expressed in the internal or external portion of the canal. Type 5: Complete osseous hypoglossal bridging extending along the entire canal. In a few recent studies, hypoglossal canal variations were classified into 5 types as above, but most studies have classified bridging as either double (type 4 and 5) or single (type 1, 2, and 3) [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners easily acquire 1 mm or thinner section thicknesses, allowing isotropic or near-isotropic reconstruction in any plane desired, to easily display the dimensions and morphology of the hypoglossal canal [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118317.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), high-resolution contrast T1-weighted images (T1WI) with fat suppression can detect the hypoglossal nerve within the enhancing venous plexus [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118317.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118317.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Currently, CT and MRI are the methods of choice for the evaluation of patients with hypoglossal nerve palsy of unknown etiology [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Osseous bridging and size asymmetry of the hypoglossal canal are major normal variations. There have been only a few reports on these variations with image analysis, however, and they were based on small numbers of skull specimens [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The true prevalence of these variations in the population is not known especially in Japanese.

If bone separation existed in the canal on CT, it was defined as &#x02018;double hypoglossal canal&#x02019;. This definition was the same as Hauser&#x02019;s definition of hypoglossal canal variation types 4 and 5 [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two radiologists (T. K., T. K. with 11 and 3 years of experience, respectively) independently reviewed the non-enhanced and enhanced axial CT results and judged whether double hypoglossal canal was present or not at a window width of 3000 and window level of 500. If discrepancies existed between the two readers, a consensus was achieved by discussion after both reading sessions were completed. The same two radiologists also determined the maximum short-axis diameter of the single hypoglossal canal by consensus. Size asymmetry was defined as a left-right difference &#x0003e; 1 mm.

We verified the hypoglossal nerve within all canals in all cases examined by MRI; no emissary veins were misidentified as hypoglossal canals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><p>The prevalence of double hypoglossal canal was 16.9%, with 14.7% unilateral and 2.2% bilateral. A sex difference was found in the prevalence of double hypoglossal canal, which was more frequent in male than in female patients (odds ratio = 1.67). Double hypoglossal canal was more frequent on the left side than on the right (odds ratio = 1.79). Size asymmetry of the hypoglossal canal was common, and the right hypoglossal canal was often smaller than the left. The prevalence of double hypoglossal canal followed the same trend as the size of single hypoglossal canals, i.e., it was more common on the left than on the right.</p><p>The hypoglossal canals are divided by connective tissue or bone, because they are generally thought to represent the fusion of three or four formerly separated vertebrae in the fetal period, resulting in basioccipital bone formation. Hauser et al. classified the hypoglossal canal into 5 variations using bone specimens. In a few recent studies, hypoglossal canal variations were classified into 5 types, but most studies have classified bridging as either double (type 4 and 5) or single (type 1, 2, and 3) [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hauser&#x02019;s classification was complicated and evaluated very small bone spurs, making the classification difficult even with MDCT. Our results suggest that a sex difference exists in the prevalence of double hypoglossal canal. A previous bone specimen study was carried out using a relatively small number of specimens and the sex difference in the prevalence of double hypoglossal canal was not statistically significant [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The sex difference in the prevalence of a double hypoglossal canal found in this study is novel. It is not clear whether this sex difference is a trait of humans in general or limited to the Japanese population. Different prevalences of double hypoglossal canal, based on bone specimens, have been found in different countries, with a range of 7% to 27% [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>According to Dodo, the prevalence of bony hypoglossal canal bridging was anatomically observed in 16.9% of Japanese with a tendency toward left side predominance of bridge formation [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our results show a similar incidence of double hypoglossal canal and left side predominance.</p><p>The prevalence of a hypoglossal canal bridging has been used as an anthropological marker to distinguish racial differences. However, our results suggest that the racial differences in the prevalence of a hypoglossal canal bridging may actually be influenced by the sex ratio of the study population.</p><p>Size asymmetry of the hypoglossal canal was common in this study, with the right hypoglossal canal often smaller than the left. The reason for this asymmetry is not clear. Okudera et al. suggested that asymmetry of the jugular bulb could occur because of negative pulse waves from the right cardiac atrium to the right jugular bulb through the straight right internal jugular vein [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118317.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The jugular foramen runs just outside of the hypoglossal canal, and the space for the occipital bone is restricted by the size of the jugular foramen. Asymmetry in the hypoglossal canal size and the prevalence of double hypoglossal canal may be influenced by the asymmetry of the jugular foramen.</p><p>Clinically, it is important to evaluate hypoglossal canal bridging to help understand various pathologic processes, such as dural AVF. The venous plexus and emissary vein enter the hypoglossal canal, which plays an important role in the venous circulation. It connects to the anterior condylar confluence and suboccipital cavernous sinus, resulting in widespread antegrade and retrograde drainage in cases with dural AVF. Bony change with dural AVF was reported in this region [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hypoglossal neurinoma, as another disease, shows enlargement of hypoglossal canal [<xref rid="pone.0118317.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There were some limitations in our study. First, we did not have autopsy results for these cases and there is no proof whether our determination of the status of the hypoglossal canal was true or not. Second, CT has only 0.42 mm/pixel resolution. If the hypoglossal canal was smaller than this, we may have missed the smaller canals and underestimated the prevalence of hypoglossal canal bridging. Third, we could not evaluate the size of the jugular vein with arterial phase contrast-enhanced CT, and so it was difficult to correlate the jugular vein and hypoglossal canal. Fourth, we evaluated only the bridging hypoglossal canals divided by a bony septum. We may have overlooked hypoglossal canals divided by a soft tissue septum or thin bony septum. The double hypoglossal canal may not be equivalent to hypoglossal canal bridging. Moreover, females have smaller hypoglossal canals and this size scaling was likely to be reflected in the thickness of the bridge. Consequently, the sexual difference may be overestimated simply because the smaller female bridges were more difficult to detect than in the males on CT. Finally, some emissary veins may have been mistaken for hypoglossal canal bridging. Although 13 cases of hypoglossal canal bridging were identified using MRI, 88 cases were evaluated by only CT. The emissary vein links the posterior fossa to the hypoglossal canal and usually runs obliquely in the occipital bone. CT can distinguish an emissary vein from the hypoglossal canal. But some emissary veins may be mistaken for a double hypoglossal canal and the prevalence of double hypoglossal canal may be overestimated.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Double hypoglossal canal was identified in 16.9% of patients, 2.2% of which were bilateral in Japanese.
