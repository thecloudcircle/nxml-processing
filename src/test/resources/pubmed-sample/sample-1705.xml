Only a few mechanisms have been demonstrated to enhance the kinetics by other means. In this work, the rate constant of the reduction of oxidized porphyrin dye is enhanced by attaching non-conjugated carbazole triphenylamine moiety using iodine/triiodide and tris(2,2&#x02032;-bispyridinium)cobalt II/III electrolytes. These results are obtained using transient absorption spectroscopy by selectively probing the regeneration kinetics at the porphyrin radical cation and the carbazole triphenylamine radical cation absorption wavelengths. The enhancement in the reduction kinetics is not attributed to changes in the driving force, but to the more exposed dye cation radical orbitals of the dichromophoric dye. The results are important for the development of high efficiency photo-electrochemical devices with minimalized energy loss at electron transfer interfaces.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Dye-sensitization of semiconductor electrodes immersed in electrolyte solutions has been applied to various applications. To better utilize the energy of the absorbed photons, energy differences at electron transfer interfaces should be minimized. For the case of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), dyes are adsorbed on a semiconductor surface and the electrode is immersed in electrolyte solutions containing redox couples. Under light irradiation, photo-excited electrons in the dyes are injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor. The resulting dye cation radicals need to be reduced by electron donors in the electrolytes faster than by the injected electrons. To reduce the dye cation radicals efficiently, typically more than 0.4 eV free energy difference between the oxidation potential of the dye and the redox potential of the redox electrolyte is required.<xref rid="cit1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Several reports show efficient oxidized dye reduction with less free energy difference, but little knowledge about the mechanism for such enhanced kinetics at a reduced driving force has been obtained.<xref rid="cit3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> As a consequence, no clear molecular design guides are available for improved sensitizers with better solar energy conversion efficiencies.</p><p>It has been proposed to covalently attach an additional electron donor moiety to sensitizers so that the photo-generated hole in the sensitizer could be transferred to the donor moiety, sometimes referred to as intramolecular charge regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).<xref rid="cit6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The rate of hole transfer can be changed by controlling the electronic coupling and the driving force for hole transfer between the units.<xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Since the distance between the injected electrons and holes in the electron donor modified &#x02013; dye molecules can be increased, recombination between the electron and the hole can be retarded (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> slower than <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>). The longer lifetime of the charge separated state allows slower dye cation reduction kinetics, in principle enabling less free energy difference (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>reg</sub>). This mechanism of enhancement is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(a)</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Utilization of intramolecular hole transfer to enhance dye cation regeneration. (a) Reduced recombination and slower regeneration kinetics; (b) faster dye regeneration kinetics at a smaller driving force using a tridimensional donor moiety.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c6sc00429f-f1"/></fig><p>However, so far no successful reports demonstrating enhanced reduction kinetics due to internal hole transfer have been published. This could be because a large, additional energy difference between the sensitizer and the new moiety (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>int</sub>) to drive efficient hole transfer is typically introduced. If the same redox mediator is used, the reduction kinetics of the oxidized electron donor moiety may be too slow due to too small &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>reg</sub> between the electron donor moiety and the redox mediator in the electrolyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(a)</xref>).</p><p>Another pathway to utilize the internal hole transfer mechanism is to increase the regeneration kinetics by attaching electron donor moieties with faster regeneration kinetics at small driving forces to sensitizers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(b)</xref>). By attaching donor units with increased tridimensionality, the exposed area of the oxidized dye orbitals to the electrolyte could be enlarged, leading to enhanced collision cross section between the electron donor in the electrolyte and the dye. Porphyrin dyes having a planar structure, typically oriented perpendicular to the semiconductor surface due to the geometry of the binding site, are good candidates to test the merit of this novel mechanism, which is the aim of this work.</p><p>We have developed a series of dichromophoric porphyrin dyes based on porphyrin and carbazole chromophores linked by a phenylethenyl linker.<xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> shows a recent example of a dichromophoric dye 5-(4-(2-cyano-2-carboxyethenyl)phenyl-15-(4-(2-(6-(4-(<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diphenylamino))))phenyl-9-(3,7-dimethyloctyl)-carbazol-3-yl)ethenyl)phenyl-10,20-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)porphyrinato zinc(<sc>ii</sc>) (Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)) consisting of a porphyrin 5-(4-(2-cyano-2-carboxyethenyl))phenyl-15-(4-methylphenyl)-10,20-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)porphyrinato zinc(<sc>ii</sc>) (Por) and 6-(4-(<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diphenylamino)phenyl)-(9-(3,5-dimethyloctyl))carbazole-3-carboxaldehyde (Cb-TPA) chromophores. The dihedral twist of 117 degrees minimized electronic communication between the two chromophores. This non-conjugated design generally leads to higher extinction coefficients and/or panchromatic absorption spectrum, without the appearance of new absorption bands in the dichromophoric dye (Fig. S1<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>).<xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The dichromophoric dye Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) when used in dye-sensitized solar cells showed improved photovoltaic performance compared to Por, attributed to improved electron injection and reduced TiO<sub>2</sub> conduction band electron recombination with oxidized species in the electrolyte.<xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Both of these improvements could be traced back to the more bulky molecular structure of Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA). On one hand, the improved dye morphology on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface eliminated the use of a coadsorber to control dye aggregation. On the other hand, the blocking effect of the bulky substituent of the dye prevented the approach of the oxidized species in the electrolyte to the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface blocking charge recombination. An overall 30% improvement compared to the Por dye in DSSCs was demonstrated.<xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Chemical structures of the compounds.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c6sc00429f-f2"/></fig><p>Here, we show that the attachment of a Cb-TPA electron donor moiety to Por dye enhances the dye radical cation reduction kinetics in Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) as compared to the Por dye. The oxidation potentials of the Por and Cb-TPA chromophores were found to be within 0.1 V of each other, leading to insignificant changes in the free energy difference for regeneration. Due to this, the hole transfer, observed by selectively probing the oxidized cation radical absorption changes using transient absorption spectroscopy, is slow and partial. The enhanced dye cation radical regeneration of the dichromophoric dye Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) is interpreted with larger exposed dye cation radical orbitals of the Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) to the electrolyte solution so that redox mediator in electrolyte can interact more easily with the dye radical cation orbitals. This work, although does not lead to practically significant benefits to DSSC performance, demonstrates a new method to increase the dye cation reduction kinetics without increasing the free energy difference.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental section</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Dichloromethane (DCM, 99.8%, Chem-Supply), tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, 99.0%, Fluka), ferrocene (Fc, 98%, Aldrich), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA, 75% in isopropanol, Aldrich), ethanol (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), TiO<sub>2</sub> paste (18-NRT, Dyesol), titanium IV chloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 97%, Ajax), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII, synthesized in house), lithium iodide (LiI, 99.9%, Aldrich), I<sub>2</sub> (99.99%, Aldrich), <italic>tert</italic>-butylpyridine (<italic>t</italic>BP, 96%, Aldrich), acetonitrile (AN, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), valeronitrile (VN, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), tris(2,2&#x02032;-bispyridine)cobalt II/III (Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>3+</sup>, synthesized in house), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, Solaronix), fluorine doped tin oxide glass (FTO glass, 2.2 mm, 7 &#x003a9; &#x025a1;<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, TEC&#x000ae;), glass microscope slides (Sail brand, 1 mm thick).</p><p>Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA), Cb-TPA and Por were synthesized as described in <xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">ref. 10</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>DFT energy calculations</title><p>DFT energy calculations were generated using the Gaussian 09W program package which implemented the Becke, three-parameter, Lee&#x02013;Yang&#x02013;Parr (B3LYP) model employing the basis set 6-31G(d).<xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A ground state Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) structure was optimized and was found to lie in an energy minimum due to the absence of imaginary frequencies.

The rather low quantum yield of hole transfer is at least partially explained by the small energy difference between the porphyrin chromophore and the Cb-TPA donor moiety, as indicated by electrochemical measurements and DFT calculations. In fact, electrochemical measurements suggested that the lowest energy oxidation state is Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) (by less than 0.1 eV). DFT calculations suggested nearly identical energies for Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)<sup>+</sup> and Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;(Cb-TPA), the former being lower in energy by only 0.006 eV. Therefore, the hole transfer based on equilibrium energetics is either slightly uphill or have close to zero driving force.</p><p>To further investigate the slow, heterogeneous and only partial hole transfer kinetics, the effect of inert electrolyte composition on the transient absorption signals of TiO<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) is examined. Note (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) that the inert Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>3+</sup> and I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>/I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> electrolytes had different concentrations of LiClO<sub>4</sub> (0.05 M and 0.1 M, respectively) and <italic>t</italic>BP (0.1 M and 0.5 M, respectively). As the LiClO<sub>4</sub> and <italic>t</italic>BP concentrations increased, the recombination kinetics at 1200 nm has become five time slower, while at 800 nm, the recombination kinetics became faster. Furthermore, the fraction of rise signal at 1200 nm in TiO<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) has increased in magnitude and shifted to shorter time scales (Fig. S5(e)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Previously, based on detailed electron lifetime measurements of a porphyrin dimer we suggested that <italic>t</italic>BP could coordinate to Zn porphyrin, slowing recombination between injected electrons and oxidised species in the electrolyte.<xref rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Following the same hypothesis, although this is highly speculative, intramolecular hole transfer and injected electron &#x02013; dye cation radical recombination kinetics may be influenced by altering the site energies due to various coordination states of <italic>t</italic>BP with the Por and Cb-TPA cation moieties. The highly dispersive rates for hole transfer between Por and Cb-TPA may also be due to various geometries of coordination of <italic>t</italic>BP to the Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) dye.</p><p>It is interesting to note that when <italic>t</italic>BP concentration is low, the reduction kinetics of Cb-TPA part by injected electron is faster than that of Por part although the distance between TiO<sub>2</sub> surface and Cb-TPA is longer (Fig. S6(e)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). We don't have a clear explanation for this result. However, similar results have been observed with a dye having longer non-conjugated linker between TiO<sub>2</sub> surface and conjugated framework of dye.<xref rid="cit17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A postulation for such observation was the different depth of injected electrons, that is, a dye with a longer non-conjugated linker would inject electron only to the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> and thus, the back transfer to the dye would be faster.<xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the different depth of electron injection cannot explain the results here because the same injection process results in the two different hole locations. Another possibility is reverse hole transfer from the Cb-TPA moiety to Por, causing faster decays at 1200 nm. This is possible for some dyes where forward hole transfer was enabled at faster time scales, but after structure relaxation and possibly <italic>t</italic>BP coordination, back transfer became possible at longer time scales. Further efforts are needed to elucidate these observations, but here we emphasize that the distance and free energy difference are not the only factors influencing interfacial electron transfer.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction kinetics by redox couples</title><p>Regeneration rate constants of oxidized dyes for redox couples were nearly equal for wide range of redox couple concentrations except for the case of the lowest I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>/I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> concentration. When the amount of adsorbed dyes was reduced, regeneration kinetics measured both at 800 nm and 1200 nm were not facilitated significantly for either Por or Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) dyes (Fig. S12&#x02013;14<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). This means that the higher regeneration constant of Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;Cb-TPA than that of Por<sup>+</sup> was not due to the higher packing density of Por on TiO<sub>2</sub>, which would prevent the easy penetration of the electrolyte donor species into the dye layer. The observed results therefore cannot be simply explained by accessibility to redox active sites.</p><p>For most of the concentration range, the reduction rate was governed by collision frequency. The reduction rate constant of Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) was two times faster than that of Por<sup>+</sup>. Since Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) can be reduced both by donor species in the electrolytes and Cb-TPA moiety, as long as the reduction by Cb-TPA moiety can compete with the reduction by the donor species, the reduction constant of Por<sup>+</sup> in Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) can be higher than that of Por<sup>+</sup> without the Cb-TPA moiety. Since the reduction by Cb-TPA moiety was observed from the nano to micro second range, the reduction constant of Por<sup>+</sup> can be faster. However, since the Por<sup>+</sup> reduction rate constant by Cb-TPA moiety is dispersive and only roughly 20% of Por<sup>+</sup> is reduced in less than a microsecond, the facilitation of the reduction rate constant of Por<sup>+</sup> in Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) was not significant.</p><p>The rate constant of Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)<sup>+</sup> was five times faster than that of Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;(Cb-TPA). This can be interpreted with more exposed surface area of molecular orbitals of Cb-TPA part to electrolytes. For Por dye, the structure is two-dimensional. So the scattering cross section of the molecules is large when donor species approach the dye along the axis, which is perpendicular to the two-dimensional surface of the porphyrin ring. On the other hand, there is a much less chance to hit the porphyrin ring if the donor species come along the two-dimensional axis. The TPA moiety has a tridimensional structure, giving higher scattering cross section for all axes, resulting higher chance of electron transfer. This hypothesis is consistent with DFT calculations showing a significant hole density on the Cb-TPA chromophore in the oxidised Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA), more prominently for the Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)<sup>+</sup>. Since this is the most accessible part of the molecule on surface of TiO<sub>2</sub>, redox interaction is more likely to occur here. Note that the higher regeneration rate constant of Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)<sup>+</sup> is significant because the free energy difference between the redox couple and Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)<sup>+</sup> is equal or only marginally different from that of Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;(Cb-TPA).</p><p>We have also studied the molecular structural effect on the reduction kinetics among metal-free organic dyes having carbazole, coumarin and TPA and found that TPA showed the fastest reduction kinetics.<xref rid="cit19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The observations in that study is consistent with the work presented here.</p><p>Between Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>3+</sup> complex and I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>/I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> redox couples, although the polarity of the redox couples is the opposite, we found the same enhancement trend. This implies that the higher reduction rate of Cb-TPA<sup>+</sup> moiety was not influenced by the electrostatic force, but more likely due to higher collision frequency as suggested above.</p><p>The high regeneration rate constant at very low I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>/I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> concentration might be caused by increased I<sup>&#x02013;</sup> concentration at the vicinity of the Cb-TPA moiety. We have proposed that dye molecules increase local I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> concentrations due to electrostatic force caused by partial charge of dye molecules or dispersion force between dye and I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>.<xref rid="cit20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Since the Cb-TPA moiety does not have any atoms with large partial charges, we expect that the faster regeneration kinetics was due to the dispersion force between the Cb-TPA and I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. On the other hand, since these forces are weak, the effect may not be so strong in the case of bulky Co complexes.</p><p>By attaching Cb-TPA moiety to Por, reduction kinetics of the oxidised Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) was slighly facilitated. For DSSCs application, the enhancement was not practically relevant. Using optimised redox concentrations, the dye regeneration kinetics of Por was fast enough not to be limiting the performance under 100 mW cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> white light illumination. Furthermore, the observed hole transfer was only partial due to the small energy difference between two states and the large dispersion of the transfer rate. Since the reduction rate constant of Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)<sup>+</sup> is five times higher than that of Por part, we expect that if the energy difference between the Por and Cb-TPA chromophores is increased, the hole transfer yield and rate will be enhanced, and the reduction rate contant of the dichromophoric dye (at both sites) will be enhanced, so the observed phenomenon has important implications for further enhancement of photovoltaic performance. Interestingly and in line with other reports,<xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> we could not find increased charge separate state lifetime of the injected electrons in TiO<sub>2</sub> and the holes at Cb-TPA moiety. Thus, to enhance the reduction kinetics, increasing distance alone may not be sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(a)</xref>). Our result suggests that attaching an electron donating moiety with large scattering cross section to a dye is a better strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(b)</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>By comparing reduction kinetics between Por and Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) adsorbed on TiO<sub>2</sub> in electrolyte solutions, attaching electron donating moiety to a sensitizer was shown to increase the reduction kinetics of oxidized molecules by redox couples. Holes generated at the Por part in Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA) were partially transferred to Cb-TPA. However, the increased distance of the separated charges did not increase the charge separated state lifetime. On the other hand, the reduction rate constant of Por&#x02013;(Cb-TPA)<sup>+</sup> was five times faster than that of Por<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;(Cb-TPA). This was explained by the larger exposed surface area of Cb-TPA molecular orbitals to electrolytes enhancing collision frequency. Our finding is that one can enhance reduction kinetics of oxidized molecules without changing the optical/physical properties of the molecules by attaching tridimensionally enlarged electron donor moieties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><alt-text>Supplementary information</alt-text><media xlink:href="SC-007-C6SC00429F-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>AJM, KCG, PW SM and TMC acknowledge support from the Australian Research Council (ARC) through Discovery Project no.
