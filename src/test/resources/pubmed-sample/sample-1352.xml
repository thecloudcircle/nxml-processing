Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, targets hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes by increasing renal glucose excretion. To investigate whether the parallel occurring sodium loss would have diuretic-like physiologic effects, we compared dapagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) effects on 24-h blood pressure (BP), body weight, plasma volume and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</p><p><bold>Methods</bold> In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 75 subjects with type 2 diabetes were assigned placebo, dapagliflozin 10&#x02009;mg/day, or HCTZ 25&#x02009;mg/day. Changes from baseline BP, body weight, plasma volume and GFR were assessed after 12&#x02009;weeks of treatment.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Subjects&#x02019; mean age was 56&#x02009;years, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) duration 6.3&#x02009;years, and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 7.5%. Treatment with placebo, dapagliflozin or HCTZ resulted in changes from baseline in 24-h ambulatory mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &#x02212;0.9 (95%CI &#x02212;4.2, +2.4), &#x02212;3.3 (95%CI &#x02212;6.8, +0.2), and &#x02212;6.6 (95%CI &#x02212;9.9, &#x02212;3.2) mmHg, respectively at week 12, adjusted for baseline SBP. Body weight decreased with dapagliflozin and HCTZ. In a sub-study plasma volume appeared to decrease with dapagliflozin but did not change with placebo or HCTZ treatment. Dapagliflozin induced a greater reduction in GFR (&#x02212;10.8%; 95%CI &#x02212;14.6, &#x02212;6.7) relative to placebo (&#x02212;2.9%; 95% CI &#x02212;6.9, +1.2) or HCTZ (&#x02212;3.4%; 95%CI &#x02212;7.3, +0.6).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Dapagliflozin-induced SGLT2 inhibition for 12&#x02009;weeks is associated with reductions in 24-h BP, body weight, GFR and possibly plasma volume. Cumulatively, these effects suggest that dapagliflozin may have a diuretic-like capacity to lower BP in addition to beneficial effects on glycaemic control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>blood pressure</kwd><kwd>dapagliflozin</kwd><kwd>HbA1c</kwd><kwd>renal function</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Many patients with diabetes present with hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and excess weight, which are associated with micro- and macrovascular complications. Therapies to alleviate the burden of these complications have traditionally focused on reducing glycaemia and optimizing blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol concentration. However, despite the various available treatment options to improve glycaemic control, many patients do not reach treatment targets. In addition, sulphonylurea derivatives and glitinides, which increase secretion of insulin, are associated with clinically important side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Novel treatment strategies are therefore required that aid in achieving therapeutic targets without inducing weight gain or hypoglycaemia.</p><p>Emerging insight in the role of the sodium&#x02013;glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in glucose reabsorption in the kidney has led to the development of selective orally available sodium&#x02013;glucose transport inhibitors. These drugs are designed to inhibit SGLT2 located mainly in the S1-segment of the proximal tubule <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. This inhibition augments urinary glucose excretion, which has proved successful in reducing plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Inhibiting SGLT2, however, also leads to reduced sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule; this can enhance sodium excretion. In previous studies <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> dapagliflozin administration has been associated with decreases in body weight and BP. Furthermore, dose-related increases in haematocrit and decreases in creatinine clearance were seen in dapagliflozin-treated patients <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. These observations suggest that a natriuretic effect of dapagliflozin may be associated with a &#x02018;diuretic-like&#x02019; antihypertensive action.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess whether dapagliflozin has diuretic-like effects along with its glucose-lowering effect. To this end, we determined the effects of dapagliflozin, hydrochlorothiazide and placebo on BP, body weight, plasma volume and renal function using dedicated measurement techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled study conducted from October 2009 to July 2010 in Canada, The Netherlands and the USA. It is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00976495).</p><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were men and women with type 2 diabetes aged between 18 and 70&#x02009;years, who had inadequate glycaemic control, defined as HbA1c &#x02265;6.6% and &#x02264;9.5%, and who were receiving a stable dose of metformin and/or a sulfonylurea derivative for at least 4&#x02009;weeks prior to study entry. Subjects had to have an enrollment C-peptide&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.27&#x02009;nmol/l, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &#x0003e;60&#x02009;ml/min/1.73&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> and &#x0003c;150&#x02009;ml/min/1.73&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>, urine albumin&#x02009;:&#x02009;creatinine ratio &#x0003c;300&#x02009;mg/g, body mass index &#x02264;45.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and inadequate BP control, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x02265;130 and &#x0003c;165&#x02009;mmHg, and/or diastolic BP &#x02265;80 and &#x0003c;105&#x02009;mmHg. Subjects with type 1 diabetes, those with cardiovascular disease within 6&#x02009;months of study entry, and pregnant women were excluded from study participation. Subjects with a history of adverse reaction to radiocontrast dye, or allergy to or contraindication for thiazide diuretics were excluded as well. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. The study was approved by the appropriate local research ethics committee and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The study consisted of a 14-day qualification period, a&#x02009;7-day single-blind lead-in period, and a double-blind treatment period of 12&#x02009;weeks. A qualification assessment was performed in all patients that included a complete medical history, safety, laboratory measurements and pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Subjects maintained their stable dose of metformin and/or sulphonylurea derivatives. Subjects who were receiving a stable dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) continued these medications. Subjects received dietary counseling during the lead-in period and throughout the study. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was initiated at the start of the lead-in period. Those patients who met the inclusion criteria and adhered to study medication were randomly assigned to dapagliflozin 10&#x02009;mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25&#x02009;mg/day, or matched placebo in a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio. Hydrochlorothiazide was chosen as active comparator as it is the most commonly used thiazide diuretic. Study treatments were allocated using a central, computer-based randomization procedure. Blinding of patients and investigators to study treatment was achieved using a double-dummy technique. Randomization was stratified globally by prior antihypertensive drug use (ACEI or ARB, or no antihypertensive drug) as well as participation in the red cell mass/plasma volume substudy. The doses of metformin and sulphonylurea derivatives as well as ACEI or ARB, if applicable, were maintained stable for the duration of the double-blind treatment period. Patients attended the clinic 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12&#x02009;weeks after randomization. At each follow-up visit, efficacy and safety parameters were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>BP was measured by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (Spacelabs 90207 BP monitor). GFR was determined by plasma disappearance of iohexol. After a 5-ml bolus iohexol infusion (300&#x02009;mg iodine/ml) blood samples were taken until 4&#x02009;h after the iohexol infusion. Plasma iohexol concentrations were measured at a central laboratory (Karolinska Institute, Uppsala, Sweden) by high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma iohexol was calculated according to a one-compartment model to obtain GFR (after correction according the Brochner&#x02013;Mortensen formula and body surface area) <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In subjects receiving metformin, the dose of metformin was withheld on the visit day of the GFR procedure until at least 48&#x02009;h after the GFR procedure according the metformin label which directs that metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated with the MDRD-formula. Plasma volume and red cell mass were simultaneously estimated using radioisotope techniques with <sup>51</sup>Cr-labelled erythrocytes and <sup>125</sup>I-labelled human serum albumin. All plasma volume and red cell mass measurements were performed at local sites. Safety and tolerability were assessed by collating data on adverse events using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 12.1).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The study was exploratory in nature and designed as a mechanism-of-action study to assess the effects of dapagliflozin on renal function, BP and circulating plasma volume. The objectives of the data analyses are primarily descriptive, and the planned total sample size of 75 subjects was determined based on administrative and logistical grounds. Confidence intervals are provided herein to facilitate the interpretation of the results, but the sample size was not intended to be sufficient to reach definitive statistical conclusions. Therefore, no statistical comparisons between treatment arms were made.</p><p>The analyses evaluated the change from baseline at week 12 in 24-h ambulatory BP, day-time and night-time BP, GFR, plasma volume and red cell mass. To account for differences in baseline values, baseline adjusted mean change in 24-h, day-time and night-time BP was analysed using an analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>) model with treatment group as an effect and baseline BP as a covariate. Baseline adjusted percentage mean change in GFR was analysed using an <sc>ancova</sc> model with treatment group and prior drug use (ACEI or ARB therapy or no antihypertensive drug use) as an effect and baseline GFR as a covariate. For the purpose of analysis, GFR values were transformed to logarithms and the changes from baseline were expressed as geometric mean percent changes from baseline. If no week 12 measurement was available,&#x02009;the last available postbaseline measurement was used for analysis of 24-h, day-time and night-time BP, and the last available postbaseline measurement after week 4 was used for analysis of GFR, plasma volume and red cell mass. Median changes in 24-h ambulatory BP, plasma volume and red cell mass are reported in the substudy because of the small sample size of the substudy and the fact that mean changes can be driven by a few extreme values. Analyses were conducted with SAS version 8.2.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 154 patients enrolled, 75 entered the double-blind treatment period (fig.

Treatment with dapagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide reduced mean 24-h SBP and in-office BP from baseline. In addition, body weight fell and, in a substudy, dapagliflozin appeared to be associated with a reduction in plasma volume. After 12&#x02009;weeks treatment an approximately 10% reduction in GFR was observed with dapagliflozin. Taken together, these results imply that the reduction in BP with dapagliflozin therapy is associated with a &#x02018;natriuretic/diuretic-like&#x02019; effect.</p><p>Previous studies have shown greater reductions of office SBP with dapagliflozin treatment than placebo treatment <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In this study, we employed ambulatory BP monitoring to allow for more precise estimation of the magnitude and the time-course of blood-pressure effects, in addition to office BP measurements. A greater decrease from baseline in mean systolic 24-h ambulatory BP was observed with dapagliflozin than hydrochlorothiazide. However, after adjusting for the differences in baseline SBP, the reduction was greater with hydrochlorothiazide. Day-time reduction in SBP was similar with dapagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide. There was no reduction in night-time BP in dapagliflozin- and placebo-treated subjects, while persistent reductions were observed in hydrochlorothiazide-treated subjects. This observed difference is unlikely to reflect pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic considerations given the steady 24-h glucosuria induced by dapagliflozin <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Whether this observed difference can be explained by diminished dapagliflozin BP effect related to the lower BPs experienced at night or by a diminished volume-driven BP effect in the recumbent position <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> cannot be ascertained from this study and requires further investigation. Mean reductions from baseline in seated in-office BP were somewhat greater for the dapagliflozin group than for the hydrochlorothiazide group. Seated in-office BP measurements were conducted during day-time which may explain the somewhat larger reduction with dapagliflozin compared to hydrochlorothiazide. The reduction in both ambulatory BP and in-office pressures indicate the antihypertensive potential of dapagliflozin. This effect may be beneficial for the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes who are often diagnosed with hypertension, although caution is warranted for a too low BP in certain populations such as the elderly or those with comorbidities.</p><p>The reduction in BP seen with dapagliflozin may well reflect a diuretic effect as a result of enhanced sodium excretion during SGLT2 blockade. A previous healthy volunteer study has shown dose-dependent effects of dapagliflozin on cumulative sodium excretion <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The initial reduction in body weight in the dapagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide arm provides further support for the diuretic effects of both agents. Dapagliflozin has been shown to induce a reduction in body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. This weight loss appears to be biphasic: an initial steep fall followed by a more gradual continuous reduction. The increased excretion of glucose and associated calorie loss appear to be mainly responsible for the reduction in body weight, as substantiated in a previous study <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, although the initial reduction in body weight can be attributed to fluid loss.</p><p>Plasma volume measurements were utilized to further characterize the diuretic effects of dapagliflozin and to compare those with a registered diuretic. The results suggest a 7% reduction in plasma volume with dapagliflozin treatment indicating a diuretic effect possibly owing to enhanced sodium excretion or osmotic diuresis as a result of increased glucose excretion. Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with increases in plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone concentration, as can be expected with diuretic-induced reductions in plasma volume. A slight increase in NT-pro-BNP was seen with dapagliflozin which is discordant with a reduction in circulating volume. A possible explanation may be the transient rise in erythropoietin which has been shown to enhance brain natriuretic peptide secretion <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; however, the small sample size and large response variability warrant cautious interpretation. It should be noted that a lack of a significant reduction in plasma volume with hydrochlorothiazide has been observed in previous long-term hemodynamic studies as well, irrespective of the BP response <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The absence of such a reduction in plasma volume with hydrochlorothiazide can be explained by either tolerance to the effects of prolonged hydrochlorothiazide treatment or the establishment of compensatory mechanisms to restore fluid balance <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>A decrease in plasma volume, with resultant haemoconcentration, could contribute to an increase in haematocrit as observed in the present and previous studies <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. However, an alternative explanation for the rise in haematocrit may be an effect of dapagliflozin on red cell mass, as suggested by the transient increases in reticulocyte count and serum erythropoietin concentrations.</p><p>Dapagliflozin and Hydrochlorothiazide caused reductions in iohexol measured GFR. The reduction in iohexol measured GFR with dapagliflozin treatment could be the consequence of increased sodium delivery at the macula densa. As a result, tubulo-glomerular feedback causes a fall in renal plasma flow, and reduction in intraglomerular pressure and GFR <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Alternatively, reductions in systemic BP or plasma volume (secondary to the diuretic effects of dapagliflozin) coupled with imperfect renal autoregulation could lead to reductions in intraglomerular pressure, as can be seen in diabetic patients <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p><p>Renal function was measured at baseline and week 12 which precluded the possibility to assess the time-course of the effect of dapagliflozin on GFR. eGFR was measured throughout the study. The difference in absolute values between measured GFR and eGFR illustrate the limitations of the latter in estimating GFR in patients with normal or near-normal renal function <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. However, eGFR can be used to assess the changes within an individual over time. The observed changes in eGFR over time suggest that dapagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide caused an acute fall in renal function which was maximally present after 2&#x02009;weeks therapy and did not further decline during the remainder of follow-up. This observation is in line with a meta-analysis on the effect of dapagliflozin on renal function that included 12 placebo controlled randomized studies and involved more than 4000 patients with preserved renal function. In that analysis dapagliflozin caused a fall in eGFR at week 1 that slowly returned to baseline by week 24 and maintained at baseline for 2&#x02009;years <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Another study in subjects with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment showed that dapagliflozin administration caused a rapid decline in eGFR, within 2&#x02009;weeks, followed by a period of minimal change in eGFR up to 52&#x02009;weeks therapy <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The pattern of acute eGFR decline followed by stabilization suggests that the acute eGFR decline reflects a (reversible) haemodynamic change rather than worsening of structural renal function <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. However, GFR was not measured after treatment cessation so that we are unable to ascertain the reversibility of the initial fall in GFR and can only speculate about a potential hemodynamic induced reversible GFR effect.</p><p>Changes in metabolic parameters such as fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and body weight were not the primary focus of this study. However, as expected, treatment with dapagliflozin caused reductions in fasting plasma glucose as well as HbA1c.</p><p>The study is limited by the fact that the small sample size does not allow definitive conclusions; it merely is hypothesis generating. In addition, consecutive 24-h urines were not collected and dietary intake of sodium was not recorded so that natriuretic effects of dapagliflozin could not be directly quantified, nor compared with hydrochlorothiazide. Third, GFR was not measured post-treatment to assess the reversibility of the initial fall in GFR with dapagliflozin or hydrochlorothiazide. Finally, the sub-study population was in general representative of the overall population although the proportion of male subjects was slightly higher in the placebo and dapagliflozin group and somewhat lower in the hydrochlorothiazide group.</p><p>In conclusion, along with glycaemic control, SGLT2 inhibition with dapagliflozin for 12&#x02009;weeks was associated with reductions in BP, body weight, GFR and possibly plasma volume. These findings suggest that the BP&#x02013;lowering effect of dapagliflozin could be driven by a decrease in circulating volume owing to diuretic/natriuretic properties of the drug. Further mechanistic studies are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>H. J. L.
