These results support the emerging view that functional impairment of neurons may be more important for the development of AD symptoms than the actual cell death which occurs at later stages of the disease <xref rid="pone.0008643-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Lambert1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>AD is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly <xref rid="pone.0008643-StGeorgeHyslop1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis implicates A&#x003b2; as having a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD <xref rid="pone.0008643-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and as a result is an important therapeutic target. Recent results have implicated soluble aggregates of A&#x003b2; for many of the toxic effects of A&#x003b2; described in AD <xref rid="pone.0008643-Shankar1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Although it is well known that one of the early hallmarks of AD is marked synaptic degeneration, its cause is only marginally understood <xref rid="pone.0008643-Knobloch1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Lacor1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. According to the leading theory, soluble oligomers of A&#x003b2; have a direct &#x0201c;synaptotoxic&#x0201d; effect at nanomolar concentrations <xref rid="pone.0008643-Lacor2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

Our hypothesis is based on the observation that A&#x003b2; decreases spontaneous activity of neurons at low concentrations and that this has a deleterious effect on cell functionality without significant cell death. According to established theories, this decreased activity would lead to the automatic elimination of synapses with low activity, but at a later time <xref rid="pone.0008643-Hua1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Nimmrich1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>It has also been shown that A&#x003b2; toxicity can be reversed to varying degrees using anti-amyloidogenic compounds (AACs) such as curcumin <xref rid="pone.0008643-Hamaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Curcumin has been shown to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties <xref rid="pone.0008643-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and reduce amyloid plaque burden in transgenic APPsw mice <xref rid="pone.0008643-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. More recently, curcumin has been shown to reduce the number of aggregates from monomeric A&#x003b2; as well as promote disassembly of preformed A&#x003b2; aggregates, in addition to inhibiting A&#x003b2; oligomer formation and A&#x003b2; toxicity at significantly lower concentrations than Ibuprofen <xref rid="pone.0008643-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Most <italic>in vitro</italic> functional electrophysiological studies on the effects of A&#x003b2; on neurons have been carried out using the patch clamp method <xref rid="pone.0008643-Lambert1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Gureviciene1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Jhamandas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although the use of this technique enables the acquisition of detailed information concerning A&#x003b2; effects at the ion channel level, it is very low throughput and complicated relative to extracellular electrophysiological techniques. A recent technological advance for non-invasive chronic monitoring of neuronal and cardiac cell electrical activity is the use of multielectrode array (MEA) recordings of action potentials <xref rid="pone.0008643-Egert1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008643-Nam1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In contrast to the more common intracellular electrophysiological techniques which usually enable only short term (&#x0003c;a few hours) monitoring of the activity of cells, MEAs are ideal for investigating long-term/chronic drug effects and also does not limit the number of cells that can be recorded from, at a single instance <xref rid="pone.0008643-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Offenhausser1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008643-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, because MEAs do not require precise positioning of electrodes, they can be used in high-throughput pharmaceutical screens <xref rid="pone.0008643-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The most common applications of MEAs include physiological or pharmacological studies in brain slices and in dissociated cell cultures of electrogenic cells including hippocampal neurons <xref rid="pone.0008643-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Golan1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, spinal cord neurons <xref rid="pone.0008643-Gross2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and cardiac myocytes <xref rid="pone.0008643-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Natarajan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, among others. Recent developments in the pharmacological applications of MEA technology <xref rid="pone.0008643-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> have shown that introduction of high-throughput functional <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophysiological assays in drug development could have significant benefits compared to the traditional <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays. For example, electrophysiologically active <italic>in vitr</italic>o neuronal networks have been maintained on microelectrode arrays for over 9 months <xref rid="pone.0008643-Gross2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. More recently, neurons on MEAs have been used to study various drug effects including antidepressants <xref rid="pone.0008643-Gramowski1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, ACHe inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0008643-Keefer1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and Zn toxicity <xref rid="pone.0008643-Parviz1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we have developed a high-throughput <italic>in vitro</italic> method for the assessment of A&#x003b2; effects on spontaneous activity of cultured neurons which can be adapted for high-throughput pharmaceutical screening.

The results obtained with MEAs correlate well with those obtained using patch clamp electrophysiology wherein A&#x003b2; at low concentrations had a deleterious effect on cell functionality without significant cell death.

The MEA recording method utilized here is non-invasive, thus long term chronic measurements are possible and it does not require precise positioning of electrodes, thus it is ideal for functional screens. Even more significantly, we believe we have now identified a new target for drug development for AD based on functional toxicity of hippocampal neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Embryonic rat neurons were plated at a density of 100 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> on DETA coated coverslips for patch clamp electrophysiology and at 200 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> on DETA coated microelectrode arrays in serum free medium. Patch clamp electrophysiology was performed after 10 days in culture as electrical function of the neurons had stabilized at this point. Sporadic firing could also be detected after 10 days using the MEAs. Starting on day 12 we were able to obtain stable, reliable recordings from the MEAs over a period of two to three days with an average firing frequency of 2.5&#x000b1;0.6 Hz (mean&#x000b1;SEM). This enabled the study of the time course of the action of low concentrations of A&#x003b2; on the neurons. Transferring the MEAs from the incubator to the recording head stage and subsequent media changes did not significantly affect the cells. No significant changes in the baseline recordings from control MEAs were observed as a result of transferring the MEAs from the incubator to the recording headstage or media changes.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Application of A&#x003b2; Abolished Spontaneous Spiking Activity</title><p>The presence of A&#x003b2; oligomers was verified using immunoblots as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008643-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Patch clamp experiments performed 24 h post-A&#x003b2; exposure revealed striking changes in the neuronal function upon exposure to 100 nM A&#x003b2;. The most significant effect was observed on spontaneous firing, namely no spontaneous action potentials were recorded in the 30 exposed cells that were studied at the 24 h time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008643-g002">Figure <italic>2A</italic>

Exogenous application of A&#x003b2; to the cells for 24 h caused an increase in the amplitude of the outward (K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) currents as well as a depolarization in the resting membrane potential, (Figure <italic>B,C</italic>). Given the small differences in cell survival compared to the control, even after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008643-g002">Figure <italic>2D</italic>
</xref>), we concluded that loss of electrophysiological function is the major response to A&#x003b2; treatment at this concentration. To confirm this finding a MTT assay (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) was performed on the amyloid treated cells and this supported the results obtained with the live dead assay.</p><fig id="pone-0008643-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008643.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Immunoblot of A&#x003b2; oligomers.</title><p>From left to right: Lane 1 is the monomer.

Administration of curcumin after the cells were exposed to A&#x003b2; for 24 hrs resulted in a gradual recovery of firing frequency to 29.9&#x000b1;0.7&#x00025; (mean&#x000b1;SEM) of the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008643-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In this paradigm, recovery of spontaneous firing was observed around 10 hrs after curcumin was applied post A&#x003b2; exposure. The recovery of spontaneous firing frequency obtained with curcumin treatment was comparable to results obtained with patch clamp electrophysiology using similar experimental paradigms, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008643-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0008643-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008643.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Reversal of the effect of A&#x003b2; on firing frequency by curcumin applied together with A&#x003b2; or after A&#x003b2; exposure.</title><p>Time course of the effect of curcumin on spontaneous firing frequency of embryonic hippocampal neurons when coadministered with A&#x003b2; (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) (A).

It is possible this effect could also precede synapse degradation or that it may be its upstream cause. Previous results had hinted at this idea, for example Chen and coworkers reported that various low concentrations of A&#x003b2; inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices <xref rid="pone.0008643-Lambert1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Based on these results, Ahuja et al. used MEA technology to measure A&#x003b2; effect on LTP in organotypic hippocampal cultures <xref rid="pone.0008643-Ahuja1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The importance of these investigations is highlighted by the significant need in the pharmaceutical industry for an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the early stages of Alzheimer disease and the functional effects of A&#x003b2; on neurons observed in the study might be considered as an <italic>in vitro</italic> AD model.</p><p>We then utilized this result to create a high-throughput screening method for antagonists of this functional toxicity caused by A&#x003b2;. The MEAs made it possible to screen a significantly higher number of cells for A&#x003b2; and drug effects in a much shorter amount of time than patch-clamp electrophysiology would have required. Development of this method could have a high impact on drug development in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The molecular target of A&#x003b2; toxicity is not well known, thus this functional screen could result in novel effective compounds or therapeutic targets. We have shown that multielectrode arrays (MEAs) can be used to reliably detect functional effects of low doses of A&#x003b2; (100 nM) as well as screen for the rescue effect of curcumin. When applied to hippocampal neurons cultured on MEAs A&#x003b2; had a pronounced effect on the spontaneous firing of the cells, even at concentrations in the nanomolar range. Treatment with A&#x003b2; stopped spontaneous activity completely and the time for cessation was concentration dependent. The A&#x003b2; oligomerization inhibitor, curcumin, was able to partially reverse the loss of spontaneous activity. In accordance with our earlier patch clamp experiments, curcumin was more effective in inhibiting the effect of A&#x003b2; when it was coadministered with it as opposed to the experiments in which it was applied 24 hrs after A&#x003b2; exposure.</p><p>Interestingly, after A&#x003b2; exposure, there was a slight but consistent increase in firing frequency just before the decline of spontaneous activity. The initial increase in firing frequency we observed at all tested A&#x003b2; concentrations could be due to an earlier reported direct depolarizing effect of A&#x003b2; on the membrane potential or to the reputed ability of A&#x003b2; to enhance glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0008643-Lipton1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008643-Mattson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> by its action on NMDA receptors and consequently, through an increased influx of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>In comparison to slice preparation, our method, measurement of the effect of A&#x003b2; on spontaneous activity of cultured neurons, is significantly simpler and more applicable in high-throughput screen methodology. Another benefit of this MEA AD model, compared to our patch-clamp experiments, was that we were able to follow the time course of the action of curcumin on the A&#x003b2; modified activity of the same population of cells. When A&#x003b2; and curcumin were applied together, curcumin reduced the deleterious effect of A&#x003b2; without a significant change in the time course of A&#x003b2; action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008643-g005">Figure <italic>5</italic>A</xref>). When A&#x003b2; and curcumin were applied sequentially, curcumin reversed the effect of A&#x003b2; and helped the cells to partially recover their spontaneous firing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008643-g005">Figure <italic>5</italic>A</xref>). Curcumin was more effective when administered together with A&#x003b2;; the cells were able to retain about 55&#x00025; of their firing capability compared to untreated controls when coadministered as opposed to only 30&#x00025; when sequentially administered. It has been shown that curcumin was able to inhibit A&#x003b2; oligomer formation and reduce amyloid toxicity <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0008643-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the presence of curcumin, reduced aggregation from monomeric A&#x003b2; and improved disassembly of preformed A&#x003b2; aggregates was observed <xref rid="pone.0008643-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Curcumin's ability to disassemble pre-formed A&#x003b2; aggregates could account for its protective effect against A&#x003b2; toxicity in the co-administration experiments, but the mechanism involved in the reversal of A&#x003b2; toxicity in the post-administration experiments needs further clarification.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that it is possible to develop a high-throughput screen for the measurements of drug effects on functional toxicity of low concentrations of A&#x003b2; and this model might be considered as an <italic>in vitro</italic> functional model of the development of Alzheimer's disease. This screen method, based on MEA technology, which enables the screening of a large number of cells, and the study of pathogen and drug effects on the same population of cells over an extended period of time, could find important applications in pharmaceutical drug development and could lead to novel drug candidates or therapies for AD. Moreover, based on similar principles, MEA technology can be potentially extended to study in vitro models of other neurodegenerative diseases as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Microelectrode Arrays</title><p>The MEAs and accompanying accessories, including the temperature controller, stimulator, amplifier and MC_Rack V 3.5.8 data acquisition software were obtained from ALA Scientific (Westbury, New York) and Multichannel Systems (Reutlingen, Germany).
