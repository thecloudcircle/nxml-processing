Here, we show that expression of the Tax transcription factor encoded by a second human retrovirus, HTLV-1, prevents or reverses the epigenetic silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA and instead induces the addition of activating epigenetic marks and the recruitment of NF-&#x003ba;B/Rel proteins to the HIV-1 LTR promoter. Moreover, in the presence of Tax, the HIV-1 DNA circles that form in the absence of integrase function are not only efficiently transcribed but also support a spreading, pathogenic integrase-deficient (IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) HIV-1 infection. Thus, retroviruses have the potential to replicate without integration, as is indeed seen with HBV. Moreover, these data suggest that integrase inhibitors may be less effective in the treatment of HIV-1 infections in individuals who are also coinfected with HTLV-1.</p></abstract><abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title><p>Integration of the proviral DNA intermediate into the host cell genome normally represents an essential step in the retroviral life cycle. While the reason(s) for this requirement remains unclear, it is known that unintegrated proviral DNA is epigenetically silenced. Here, we demonstrate that human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) mutants lacking a functional integrase (IN) can mount a robust, spreading infection in cells expressing the Tax transcription factor encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1). In these cells, HIV-1 forms episomal DNA circles, analogous to hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNAs (cccDNAs), that are transcriptionally active and fully capable of supporting viral replication. In the presence of Tax, induced NF-&#x003ba;B proteins are recruited to the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoters present on unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, and this recruitment in turn correlates with the loss of inhibitory epigenetic marks and the acquisition of activating marks on histones bound to viral DNA. Therefore, HIV-1 is capable of replication in the absence of integrase function if the epigenetic silencing of unintegrated viral DNA can be prevented or reversed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>HTLV-1</kwd><kwd>Tax</kwd><kwd>integrase</kwd><kwd>cccDNA</kwd><kwd>integrase inhibitors</kwd><kwd>epigenetic gene regulation</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>human T-cell leukemia virus</kwd><kwd>human immunodeficiency virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-AI064518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><count count="5" count-type="supplementary-material"/><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="10044"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>May/June 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Integration of the proviral DNA intermediate into the chromosomal DNA of infected cells is a defining step of the retroviral life cycle (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Indeed, inhibition of integrase (IN) function is an effective means of blocking human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) replication in not only T cells but also in macrophages, and IN inhibitors are routinely used as part of antiretroviral drug combinations (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, the reason(s) why proviral integration is essential for productive HIV-1 replication remain unclear. Of note, even though the hepadnaviruse hepatis B virus (HBV) also generates double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) copies of genome-length viral RNAs by reverse transcription, chromosomal integration of this dsDNA does not form part of their replication cycle. So why is HBV able to replicate without chromosomal integration, and, conversely, why is integration a critical step in all retroviral replication cycles?</p><p>A potential answer to these questions has emerged from the study of how not only HBV but also other DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, are able to express their dsDNA genome. Specifically, HBx facilitates HBV gene expression by inducing the degradation of two cellular factors, SMC5 and SMC6, that otherwise block transcription of HBV episomes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). SMC5 and SMC6 localize to PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), also called ND10, and depletion of the PML-NB components PML and Sp100 rescues the transcription of HBV episomes even in the absence of HBx (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). PML-NBs also serve as components of the innate immune response to infection by herpesviruses (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In the case of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), the incoming dsDNA genome is sensed by cellular factors, including IFI16, and then decorated with repressive chromatin modifications, including H3K9me<sup>3</sup> and H3K27me<sup>3</sup> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, these inhibitory marks are then removed in a process that is dependent on the disruption of PML-NB function by the HSV1 immediate early protein ICP0 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Thus, cells have evolved an innate antiviral restriction pathway that recognizes extrachromosomal viral dsDNA as &#x0201c;nonself&#x0201d; and induces its epigenetic silencing (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Conversely, dsDNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to counter this restriction. In the case of HBV and most herpesviruses, this depends on viral proteins that induce the degradation of cellular factors that would otherwise epigenetically silence viral DNA, including SMC5/SMC6 in the case of HBV HBx and the PML-NB components PML and Sp100 in the case of HSV-1 ICP0 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Conversely, we hypothesize that retroviruses avoid cellular restriction factors that recognize and silence extrachromosomal DNA by integrating their proviral DNA into the host genome, where it eludes detection. It is well established that unintegrated retroviral DNA is rapidly loaded with histones that are then decorated with repressive chromatin marks that induce epigenetic silencing (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the case of unintegrated murine leukemia virus (MLV) DNA, epigenetic silencing is mediated not by PML-NBs but rather by a DNA binding protein called NP220 acting in concert with the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, the HUSH complex does not play a role in silencing unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Here, we report the surprising result that the epigenetic silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is prevented or reversed by ectopic expression of the Tax transcription factor encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1). In the presence of Tax, integrase-deficient (IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) HIV-1 is able to effectively transcribe the circular DNA molecules that form in the nucleus in the absence of integrase function to mount a spreading cytopathic infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>If the inability of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA to be effectively transcribed is caused by host restriction factors, then the level of inhibition might vary between different cell types, as has indeed been previously reported (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). To confirm and extend this observation, we infected primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and various human cell lines with an NL4-3-based indicator virus in which the <italic>nef</italic> gene was replaced with the Nano luciferase (NLuc) indicator gene (NL-NLuc). Cells were infected with wild-type (WT) HIV-1, with an IN mutant (D64V) that lacks integrase function, or with WT HIV-1 in the presence of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M raltegravir (RAL), which blocks IN function (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Levels of NLuc expression were quantified and normalized to WT HIV-1, which was set at 100%. Similar levels of NLuc expression were observed whether IN activity was blocked by the D64V mutation or by RAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). These data revealed variable levels of inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression when proviral integration was blocked. Thus, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), H9, CEM, CEM-SS, SupT1, and Jurkat cells all showed a &#x0003e;50-fold reduction in NLuc expression in the absence of IN function, while HeLa, THP1, A549, and 293T cells retained from 2% to 12% residual NLuc activity. Remarkably, MT2 cells retained &#x0223c;70% of the NLuc expression in the absence of IN function, while C8166 cells supported similar levels of NLuc expression whether IN was active or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Moreover, while infection of CEM-SS cells with the D64V IN mutant resulted, as expected, in minimal viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>) and did not reduce cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>), IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 was capable of almost WT levels of replication in C8166 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1E</xref>), resulting in indistinguishable cytopathic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Differential gene expression and replication of integrase-deficient (IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) HIV-1.

In contrast, while the &#x00394;Env version of the IN<sup>+</sup> virus also gave rise to peak DNA levels at 2&#x02009;dpi, there was only a modest decline in viral DNA by 7&#x02009;dpi, regardless of Tax expression.

While all three forms of unintegrated viral DNA could be transcriptionally active, 2LTR circles have the unique ability to generate a novel HIV-1 transcript, called 2LTR RNA, that initiates in what would normally be the 3&#x02032; LTR and is then polyadenylated in the 5&#x02032; LTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Analysis of the formation of 2LTR circular DNA in HIV-1 infected CEM-SS cells, in the presence and absence of Tax, revealed a low level in the IN&#x02212; infected culture at early times after infection in the absence of Tax, but high and gradually increasing levels of 2LTR DNA in the presence of Tax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>).

Interestingly, Tax had an unexpected effect on the formation of 2LTR circles by IN+ WT virus. Specifically, while WT HIV-1 growing in CEM-SS cells in the absence of Dox induction gave rise, as expected, to low levels of 2LTR circles, this level was dramatically increased when Tax expression was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>). Similarly, when we analyzed the expression level of the predicted 2LTR RNA by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), we observed essentially undetectable levels in CEM-SS T cells infected by IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 in the absence of Tax, but high and gradually increasing levels of 2LTR RNA when the same IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> virus was used to infect Tax-expressing CEM-SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3D</xref>).

Thus, Tax causes WT HIV-1 to form higher levels of 2LTR circular DNA, which is efficiently transcribed to generate both full-length HIV-1 transcripts and the 2LTR noncoding RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>).

Therefore, we predicted that Tax, which induces the efficient transcription of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, was likely preventing the latter effect. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR to quantify the level of two inhibitory chromatin modifications (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) and two activating chromatin modifications (H3K4me3 and H3Ac) on integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 DNA in the presence and absence of Tax.

Previously, Tax has been reported to activate both RelA/p65 and RelB (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), both of which are potent transcriptional activators that are known to bind the two canonical NF-&#x003ba;B sites found in the HIV-1 LTR U3 region. The use of ChIP-PCR to test whether Tax expression induced the recruitment of increased levels of RelA and/or RelB to the HIV-1 LTR indeed revealed a large, statistically significant increase in the recruitment of both RelA and RelB to both integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 DNA upon expression of Tax in infected CEM-SS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>).</p><p>As noted above, it has previously been reported that the epigenetic silencing of unintegrated murine leukemia virus (MLV) proviral DNA is mediated by the cellular DNA binding protein NP220 acting in concert with the HUSH complex (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Surprisingly, this report also documented that the HUSH complex was not involved in silencing unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, a result that is consistent with the inability of the HIV-2 Vpx protein, a known inhibitor of HUSH complex function (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), to rescue gene expression from unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>). We used CRISPR/Cas to mutationally inactivate the NP220 gene in 293T cells by deletion of the entire NP220 DNA binding domain and simultaneous introduction of stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">B</xref> in the supplemental material). Surprisingly, loss of NP220 function had no effect on the level of silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5B</xref>), thus confirming that the silencing of unintegrated MLV DNA and that of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA are indeed mechanistically distinct. The obvious other potential factor mediating unintegrated HIV-1 DNA silencing is PML-NBs, given their known role in the epigenetic silencing of nuclear DNA viruses (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, knockdown of the key PML-NB components PML, ATRX, and Daxx, either individually or simultaneously, using RNA interference (RNAi) did not significantly enhance gene expression from unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">D</xref>). It could be argued that RNAi does not fully deplete targeted proteins and that the residual level of PML-NB function might still be sufficient to silence unintegrated HIV-1 DNA.

Increased HIV-1 DNA levels were not observed when a replication-incompetent, <italic>env</italic>-deficient HIV-1 strain was analyzed, and hence must result from virus spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). Interestingly, while all of the HIV-1 DNA produced during the spreading infection mounted by IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 in the presence of Tax was, as expected, unintegrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">F</xref>), much of this DNA is in the form of HIV-1 DNA circles, with 2LTR circles contributing &#x0223c;30% of the total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">F</xref>). These 2LTR circles in turn produce readily detectable levels of a unique HIV-1 noncoding RNA consisting solely of the two viral LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>). Unexpectedly, the 2LTR RNA was also detected in Tax-expressing CEM-SS cells infected with IN<sup>+</sup> HIV-1, but only minimally in non-Tax-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3D</xref>), which correlated with a substantial increase in the production of 2LTR circular DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>). The reason for this phenomenon is not known, but we speculate that Tax is activating cellular DNA binding proteins, including NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>), that bind to unintegrated HIV-1 DNA and not only induce the transcription of that DNA but also sterically hinder proviral integration, resulting in the increased production of transcriptionally active, unintegrated HIV-1 DNA in IN<sup>+</sup> HIV-1 infected cells.</p><p>Previously, it was reported that unintegrated retroviral DNA is rapidly chromatinized after nuclear entry and then decorated with inhibitory epigenetic marks that are removed by an unknown process after integration occurs (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that Tax expression also reduces the deposition of inhibitory chromatin marks, and increases the deposition of activating marks, on unintegrated proviral DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>). This, in turn, correlates with an increase in the recruitment of the NF-&#x003ba;B/Rel family members RelA/p65 and RelB, both of which are activated by Tax, to the HIV-1 LTR on unintegrated DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>). Because activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is essential for the ability of Tax to rescue the viability of IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>), and because treatment with the NF-&#x003ba;B inducer TNF-&#x003b1; also selectively rescues gene expression from IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>), we speculate that NF-&#x003ba;B recruitment to the unintegrated viral DNA induces the observed epigenetic changes. However, Tax has also been proposed to play a role in chromatin remodeling in HTLV-1-infected cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We observed that Tax also enhances the recruitment of NF-&#x003ba;B proteins to integrated HIV-1 DNA, as previously reported (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which is consistent with the higher level of IN<sup>+</sup> HIV-1 gene expression shown in, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2C</xref>.</p><p>Our data, and previous work from the Goff laboratory, are consistent with the hypothesis that proviral DNA integration allows escape from the epigenetic silencing that occurs if integration is blocked (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, this hypothesis does not preclude the possibility that integration also facilitates other aspects of retroviral replication. For example, integrated proviruses have the potential to be passed on to daughter cells after cell division, and some retroviruses, such as HTLV-I, clearly use vertical transmission as a mechanism to increase viral load. In addition, in rapidly dividing cells, such as activated T cells, unintegrated HIV-1 proviruses, which lack an origin of replication, are rapidly lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2E</xref>). However, IN inhibitors also block HIV-1 gene expression in nondividing macrophages (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), so this cannot be the only reason for proviral integration.</p><p>Given that many nuclear DNA viruses express proteins, such as HSV-1 ICP0 and the HBV HBx protein, that block the epigenetic silencing of their episomal DNA genomes, the question arises as to why retroviruses have not evolved a similar strategy. One answer is that proviral integration clearly serves several purposes, as noted above, but the second is that something similar may in fact have occurred. If a simple retrovirus were to somehow acquire a gene product that could block epigenetic silencing of unintegrated proviruses, then one might expect the resultant virus to retain the <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>env</italic> genes, as well as a truncated <italic>pol</italic> gene lacking integrase, and to acquire a novel noncoding gene that blocks epigenetic silencing. In fact, this is a reasonable description of the HBV genome (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). HBV encodes a Gag homolog called the core (C) protein, Env homologs called surface (S) proteins, a Pol homolog called polymerase (P) protein that retains reverse transcriptase activity yet lacks integrase function, and finally the HBx nonstructural protein that blocks the epigenetic silencing of viral cccDNAs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Two papers from the Engelman laboratory are relevant to the findings reported here. Specifically, Nakajima et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) reported that IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 can replicate in the HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines C8166 and MT4 but not in T-cell lines not infected by HTLV-1, such as Jurkat. These authors concluded that &#x0201c;productive replication in the absence of integrase function most likely required the illegitimate integration of HIV-1 into host chromosomes&#x0201d; and, as a result, they did not investigate whether Tax expression was indeed either necessary or sufficient to support IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 replication, as we show here. Moreover, our data demonstrate that IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 replication clearly does not involve &#x0201c;illegitimate integration&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>) but rather results from the active transcription of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA. In a second paper from the Engelman laboratory, it was demonstrated that, if the HIV-1 genome was modified by insertion of an origin of DNA replication from the polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40) and engineered to express SV40 T antigen (TAg), then IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 replication was possible (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). As one would predict, this rescue correlated with the amplification of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA circles in the presence of TAg. In contrast, rescue of IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 replication by Tax does not result in any increase in HIV-1 DNA copy numbers except that due to virus spread, as seen most clearly when viral replication is blocked after one round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2E</xref>).</p><p>Over 10 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-1, and HTLV-1 infection is widespread in certain populations across the world. Indeed, rates of HTLV-1/HIV-1 coinfection of up to 10% have been reported in some countries in Africa (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). HTLV-1, like HIV-1, infects T lymphocytes, but unlike HIV-1, which rapidly kills infected T cells, HTLV-1 Tax activates cellular survival and proliferative pathways that instead induce T-cell proliferation, eventually leading, in a minority of infected patients, to an aggressive cancer called adult T-cell leukemia (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). HTLV-1-infected CD4-positive (CD4<sup>+</sup>) T cells can be fairly common in infected individuals, and the data reported here demonstrate that Tax expression can rescue the replication of IN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HIV-1 regardless of whether integrase function is lost due to mutagenesis or drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We therefore speculate that integrase inhibitors may be less effective in the treatment of dually HTLV-1- and HIV-1-infected individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cell culture and cell line generation.</title><p>293T, HeLa, and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic-antimycotic solution.
