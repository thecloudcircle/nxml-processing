All patients in publicly financed healthcare in Sweden are insured by the Mutual Insurance Company of Swedish County Councils (L&#x000f6;f). We assessed the proportion of patients that sustained a major preventable AE and filed an AE claim to L&#x000f6;f.</p><p>Patients and methods &#x02014; We performed retrospective record review using the Global Trigger Tool to identify AEs in a Swedish multi-center cohort consisting of 1,998 patients with a total or hemi hip arthroplasty. We compared the major preventable AEs with all patient-reported claims to L&#x000f6;f from the same cohort and calculated the proportion of filed claims.</p><p>Results &#x02014; We found 1,066 major preventable AEs in 744 patients. L&#x000f6;f received 62 claims for these AEs, resulting in a claim proportion of 8%. 58 of the 62 claims were accepted by L&#x000f6;f and received compensation. The claim proportion was 13% for the elective patients and 0.3% for the acute patients. The most common AE for filing a claim was periprosthetic joint infection; of the 150 infections found 37 were claimed.</p><p>Interpretation &#x02014; The proportion of filed claims for major preventable AEs is very low, even for obvious and serious AEs such as periprosthetic joint infection.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="4541"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>In Sweden, cemented total hip arthroplasty was the 7th most performed surgery in 2016 (SPOR <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and over 20,000 are performed every year (K&#x000e4;rrholm et al. <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). High-volume surgeries may generate a considerable number of adverse events (AEs). The AE rate following elective total hip arthroplasty ranges from 4.1% to 10% (Huddleston et al. <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Bohl et al. <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, Richards et al. <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>The Swedish Patient Injury Act states that all healthcare providers are obliged to have insurance covering AEs (Swedish Parliament <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Additionally, providers are obliged to urgently inform patients who sustain an AE about their right to claim compensation (Swedish Parliament <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). All publicly financed Swedish healthcare and most privately financed, regardless of whether the provider is public or private, is insured by L&#x000f6;f (&#x0201c;Landstingens &#x000d6;msesidiga F&#x000f6;rs&#x000e4;kringsbolag&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;the Mutual Insurance Company of Swedish County Councils&#x0201d;).</p><p>Patients who sustain an AE have the right to file a claim to L&#x000f6;f. The claim is assessed by experts at L&#x000f6;f and if the insurance terms are fulfilled, the patient will receive compensation. It is a non-fault insurance system, and there is no legal consequence for either the individual caregiver, or the healthcare provider.</p><p>Orthopedics is the specialty with the largest amount (28%, n = 1,492) of accepted AEs that received compensation in 2016 (L&#x000f6;f <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Considering the high number of hip arthroplasties and the incidence of AEs, there is reason to suspect that too few patients file insurance claims after AEs.</p><p>We assessed the proportion of patients who sustained a major preventable AE and filed a claim for compensation to L&#x000f6;f.</p><sec id="s0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a national multi-center cohort study on data from medical records, insurance records and register data.

The surgeries were performed in 24 different hospitals (6 university hospitals, 5 central county hospitals, 7 county hospitals, and 6 private hospitals reimbursed by the county councils).

With the crossed-linked dataset, we generated a timeline for each patient and tracked all their admissions and acute outpatient visits at hospitals across Sweden. Medical records from the different hospitals were either reviewed on location in various electronic medical record systems or obtained on paper copies. We reviewed claims data on location at L&#x000f6;f using the organization&#x02019;s claims handling software.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Definitions, inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>We defined the index admission as the time from patient arrival on the ward to discharge from the ward or the following geriatric or rehabilitation ward. We defined an AE as suffering, physical harm or disease, and death related to the index admission that was not an inevitable consequence of the patient&#x02019;s disease or treatment. A preventable AE was an event that could have been prevented if adequate actions had been taken during the patient&#x02019;s contact with healthcare (SFS 2010:659, Swedish Parliament <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). AEs related to both acts of omission and commission were included.</p><p>The inclusion period for all AEs was from the index admission to 90 days postoperatively. We excluded all planned outpatient care and primary care visits. We reviewed 5,422 admissions in 69 hospitals. We included only AEs that were related to index admission. We excluded AEs that were caused during the care for other AEs.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Review process</title><p>The review process has been described in detail in a previous article (Magn&#x000e9;li et al. <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). We used the Swedish adaptation of the Global Trigger Tool (GTT) (Griffin and Resar <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), called the Mark&#x000f6;rbaserad journalgranskning (Sveriges Kommuner och Landsting <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), a retrospective record review method for identifying AEs. The GTT is a well-studied method that identifies more AEs than other methods (Naessens et al. <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Classen et al. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A study-specific manual was created and included all alterations for the GTT.</p><p>GTT consists of a 2-stage review process. The first reviewers screened the record searches for any of the 38 predefined triggers indicating a potential AE. In stage 2 the reviewers performed an assessment of potential AEs identified via the triggers and deemed whether they met the inclusion criteria of an AE. The identified potential AEs were assessed regarding causality using a 4-point Likert scale and only included the AEs that were assessed to be caused by the healthcare (those classified as 3 or 4). The severity of the AEs was assessed and classified using a version of the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) index (National Coordinating Council for Medication Error and Reporting and Prevention 2001). We included categories E&#x02013;I. AEs that scored 3 or 4 on the preventability 4-point Likert scale were defined as preventable AEs. The preventable AEs that scored F or more on the NCC MERP index were defined as major preventable AEs.</p><p>We performed double review of 6% of the records to assess the agreement of the reviewers in the stage 1 review. We evaluated whether at least 1 trigger or potential AE was identified in the record, whether the record was to be forwarded to secondary review, whether they found the same specific event, and whether this event was a potential AE.</p></sec><sec id="s0009"><title>Patient insurance</title><p>According to the Patient Injury Act (Swedish Parliament <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), the patient has the right to receive compensation if there is predominant probability that the AE was caused by 1 of the following:

Filing a claim is free of charge. Before 2017, the claim to L&#x000f6;f must have been made within 3 years after the AE was noticeable. L&#x000f6;f can compensate for loss of income, other expenses, pain and suffering, and medical invalidity. All assessments are on the individual patient; therefore, the range of compensation, even for the same type of AE, is wide, and study includes too few patients to draw conclusions on compensation levels for different AEs.

We included the claims for AEs within 90 days following surgery that were filed during the 3-year time limit to file claims. We defined confidence intervals (CI) at 95%.</p><p>We calculated the claim proportion in the study population with a customized bootstrap function that works as follows: the dataset consists of patient id, sample group (1&#x02013;20), whether the patient had filed a claim or not and whether the patient had a major preventable AE or not. In each sample group the same number of patients in the group were sampled with replacements. In each group we calculated the filed claim proportion (number of filed claims/number of major preventable AEs). This was multiplied by the group proportion (size of the corresponding group in the study population/study population). The rate times proportion for all 20 groups was summed and this is the point estimate for the claim proportion in the study population. This procedure corresponds to 1 bootstrap repetition and it was repeated 20,000 times. The mean of the samples was the final point estimate and the confidence interval was calculated by using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. For the acute and the elective, the corresponding 10 sample groups were used and for all patients the groups were pooled. The proportion ratio was the mean of the elective patients/mean of the acute patients.

PJI was the most common AE for filing claims. The proportion of filed claims was almost 50 times higher for the elective patients compared with the acute. In our earlier paper (Magn&#x000e9;li et al. <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) we found that the 30 days&#x02019; incidence of major preventable AEs was more than double for acute patients, compared with the elective (21% vs. 10%). Despite this, only 5 of 62 claims concerned acute surgeries. 58 of the 62 claims were accepted by L&#x000f6;f, suggesting that only obvious AE claims are filed.</p><sec id="s0017"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength of this study is the large study cohort and the use of a thorough method for measuring AEs. The study also includes both total and hemiarthroplasties as well as acute and elective surgery, which have not been studied before. This provides a better understanding of the numbers of AEs claimed.</p><p>The use of a weighted sample is practical for accumulating high numbers of AEs in a study, but the rates have to be adjusted according to the group weights to represent the proportion in the population. This study includes a wide range of detected AEs of different severity. Many of the minor AEs in the study would likely not result in an accepted claim by L&#x000f6;f. However, the proportion of filed claims for PJI, arguably a severe AE, was only 1 in 4.</p></sec><sec id="s0018"><title>Interpretation and generalizability</title><p>Similar to our findings, a recent Swedish study by Kasina et al. (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) revealed that 25% of the PJIs after total hip arthroplasty filed a claim and that 96% of the claims were accepted by L&#x000f6;f.</p><p>Helkamaa et al. (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) studied filed claims after total hip arthroplasty in Finland, which has a similar patient insurance program to that in Sweden, and found that 44% were accepted, a considerably lower rate than the Swedish studies.</p><p>The difference in claims proportion between the acute and elective patients can probably be explained by the fact that these are 2 completely different patient groups and the age difference (median 84 vs. 73) might lead to lower capacity to assimilate information about L&#x000f6;f and act upon it.</p><p>PJI was the most common AE for filing a claim. L&#x000f6;f will almost always approve PJI claims. If we hypothesize that all PJIs identified in our study would have been deemed as preventable AEs by L&#x000f6;f, the remaining 114 (76%) PJIs would have received compensation had they filed a claim. Hypothetically, this corresponds to approximately &#x020ac;600,000 of unexploited compensation in this study alone. The incidence rates for PJI are 0.9% after total hip arthroplasty (Lindgren et al. <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and 5&#x02013;6% for hemiarthroplasty (de Jong et al. <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, Guren et al. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In 2015, over 16,000 total hip arthroplasties and 4,200 hemiarthroplasties were performed in Sweden, which would hypothetically generate 350 to 396 PJIs per year, with 263 to 297 of these not filing a claim. This would correspond to &#x020ac;1.4&#x02013; 1.6 million of unexploited compensation each year.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proportion of filed claims for major preventable AEs following hip arthroplasty is very low in Sweden. This is true even for obvious and serious AEs such as periprosthetic joint infection. The proportion of filed claims is higher for elective than acute patients. Whether the healthcare system fails to inform patients about their right to claim for compensation or the patients are informed but choose not to file a claim is unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s0020"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> are available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2019.1677382">supplementary data</ext-link> in the online version of this article, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2019.1677382">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2019.1677382</ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6628"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="IORT_A_1677382_SM6628.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d37e151" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MM collected, analyzed, and interpreted the data and contributed to the drafting of the work.
