How particulate matter contributes to epigenetic changes that in turn influence cytokine gene expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells remains unclear. In this study, 105 children diagnosed with AR and 90 healthy controls were recruited to explore the possible mechanism of particulate matter (PM) on the epigenetic regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup>T <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> and <italic>IL-4</italic> promoter genes. Daily average PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were obtained from five state-controlled monitoring stations, and activity-based dynamic exposure and personal exposure data were collected. DNA methylation patterns of <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> and <italic>IL-4</italic> promoter regions were analyzed using bisulfite sequencing. mRNA levels were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We found that the methylation rate in <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> was higher in AR CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells than in the controls. <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> mRNA expression was significantly decreased in CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, and negatively correlated with the mean methylation level of <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic>. However, no correlation between <italic>IL-4</italic> methylation and <italic>IL-4</italic> mRNA expression was found. After adjusting for age, gender, exclusive breastfeeding within 4 months after birth and parental history of allergic disease, out data showed that PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure level was positively correlated with methylation level in <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> promoter region and decreased cytokine expression. We conclude that the effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on pediatric AR may be mediated through epigenetic modification of <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> promoter region.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pediatric allergic rhinitis</kwd><kwd>particulate matter</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>IFN-&#x003b3;</kwd><kwd>IL-4</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The prevalence of allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis (AR) in children appears to be increasing globally, including in China. In 2013, Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> reported an AR prevalence of 48% in 3&#x02013;5 years old children in Beijing, China based on surveys via questionnaires [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although the etiology of AR remains uncertain, there is evidence suggesting that the allergic response is associated with certain ambient air pollutant exposure [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution is one of the most serious environmental challenges in China, with an important impact on human health, especially in children and other susceptible populations. The adverse health effects associated with air pollution exposure may be attributed to short-term (a few minutes to one day) or long-term (a few months to a few decades) exposure, and different pollutants may have widely different exposure-response characteristics [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among pollutants, PM with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 &#x000b5;m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), as the primary air pollutant in China, is much higher than the recommended criterion by the WHO &#x0201c;global air quality guidelines&#x0201d; in 2006 [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PM2.5 can be easily conjugated to toxic heavy metals, organic pollutants, bacteria, viruses and other common allergens in the air, which causes far more damage to human health than PM<sub>10</sub> (an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 &#x000b5;m) due to its size and relatively large surface area [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A number of epidemiological studies have found that exposure to air pollution could generate a variety of negative health effects, including increased frequency and severity of AR, especially AR combined with asthma [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Environmental pollutants play an important role in regulating the occurrence and progression of allergic diseases that may be regulated through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic change in DNA methylation is recognized as an important transcriptional regulator, which allows the methylation of the promoter region and other regulatory sequences and tends to reversibly suppress gene transcription [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Sofer <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that methylation patterns of asthma pathway were related to black carbon and sulfide exposures in the environment, suggesting that air pollution might affect airway response by changing gene methylation status.</p><p>The mechanism of chronic allergic inflammation is dominated by type 2 helper T cells (Th2) response, which mostly results from the imbalance between type I helper T cells (Th1) and Th2 that belong to CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells. T helper cell polarization to Th2 usually changes the sections of Th1/Th2 signatory cytokines as shown in differentiation with IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 are among methylation sensitive genes given a large number of CpG islands and loci in the promoter regions of these genes, which can be regulated by methylation and play major roles in the process of epigenetic regulation [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a murine model, PM is capable of changing DNA methylation status in peripheral blood of sensitized individuals as well as IFN-&#x003b3; hypermethylation and IL-4 hypomethylation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, resulting in Th1/Th2 imbalance and cytokine expression change [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A hypermethylation with increased or hypomethylation with reduced level of CpG island is methylation relative to the normal tissue specific pattern. Therefore, environmental pollutants might lead to the occurrence of allergic diseases by altering methylation in the promoter regions of IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-4, and aggravating Th1/Th2 imbalance. This finding would suggest a new paradigm for AR etiology.</p><p>As AR results from genetic and environmental conditions, high risk environmental factors on epigenetic changes can induce different cascade that contribute to individual cell recognition. Herein, we conducted a case-control study to demonstrate the dynamic exposure of PM on AR. The study was conducted in a group of children with AR with one-year dynamic exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. The Kriging interpolation method was used according to PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> data in combination with residential addresses and latitude and longitude data of meteorological monitoring sites. In addition, the Shanghai particle penetration coefficient model was applied as well as indoor and outdoor activity time [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The possible epigenetic mechanism of PM exposure in pediatric AR was then explored in combination with selected CpG methylation patterns of IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; promoter genes in CD4<sup>+</sup>cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Subject demographic data</title><p>AR group was classified according to the serum allergen-specific IgE category. Serum IgE detection showed that allergens were 85 (80.6%), 25 (23.8%), 16 (80.6%) and 9 (15.2%) corresponding to house dust mites, tree powder, dog/cat hair and mixed allergens, respectively. The assessment of individual exposure to PM and blood sample collection at the end of the end of 2013 was performed in 105 children with AR and 90 matched cases recruited into the control group. General information and family demographic data are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. There were no differences between the two groups in most characteristics, except that it is significant different in the exclusive breastfeeding within 4 months after birth and parental history of allergic disease. In addition, the daily air pollution concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were 67.4 and 33.4 ug/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, in Pudong New Area, Shanghai during the study

AR in children has a major impact on the quality of daily life including loss of sleep,and productivity, and further undermines the children&#x02019;s ability to function well during the school day [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Environmental factors modulate clinical and immunological phenotype influences on atopic sensitization and allergic disease development in childhood. High PM episodes in Shanghai are widely recognized as one of the major environmental and public health challenges.The fact that high levels of ambient air contaminants enhance the risk of elevated frequency of clinic visits for AR has been reported [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. IgE mediated allergic reactions to proteins are more severe since PM and some other air pollutants have synergistic effects. The exact mechanism seems to be that air pollutants can affect the immune function by changing the structure of epithelial cells, increasing the sensitivity of specific antigens, and aggravating allergic reaction rather than simple superposition of the effects [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the detailed mechanisms for the adverse effects of PM inhalation on human health remain unknown. Environmental exposure is believed to induce epigenetic changes, which appears to be an important modifier of disease susceptibility.</p><p>In this study, we showed that high methylation at selected CpG sites of the IFN-&#x003b3; promoter were identified in children with AR for the first time, which may be affected by exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Therefore, it is very important for early prevention and individualized treatment strategies to evaluate the effects of different risk factors in the environment on pediatric AR.</p><p>We used both residential PM estimates by Kriging interpolation model and time-activity-based exposure estimates to ensure the accuracy, given the consideration of individual&#x02019;s mobility and the fact that spatiotemporal variability of ambient air pollution affects personal exposure estimates, In our study, activity-based dynamic exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were 62.8 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> and 43.2 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> in AR children that is nearly 3 -fold the PM annual standards in the USA, which was significantly higher than those in the control group. Exposure estimates derived from individual exposure assessments will provide an opportunity for us to investigate their implications on public health by combining individual exposure estimates with socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental information [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Then we compared the methylation status of cytokine genes and assessed the relationship with cytokine mRNA expression between children with AR and the control subjects, identifying significantly IFN-&#x003b3; high level of methylation in CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from AR group and altered cytokine expression. In contrast, IL-4 had slightly low level methylation, which was unrelated to high expression of IL-4. In pathogenesis of AR, Th2 differentiation, an important characteristic of chronic allergic inflammation, is prominent that results in T helper cell polarization to Th2. IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; are major cytokines that affect the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup>T lymphocytes into Th1 and Th2 lineage. IFN-&#x003b3; is a highly active and multi-functional cytokine that is released by Th1 cells. IFN-&#x003b3; promotes Th1 cell differentiation and activates macrophages, resulting in further differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells into Th1 cells. IFN-&#x003b3; can also inhibit the transcription and translation of IL-4 that inhibits Th2 cell differentiation. The differences in the direction of T cell differentiation can be explained by epigenetic variation in signal transmission,.Epigenetics is thought to be a regulator for the transcription of Th genes and cytokine production in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that the stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup>T lymphocytes causes considerable increases in the degree of unmethylation <italic>in vitro</italic><sup>15</sup> after allergen sensitization and methylation of Th genes was influenced by inhaled environmental exposures in experimental asthma [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, a report suggested that PM could enhance aeroallergen sensitization in the respiratory tract, IgE sensitivity to allergens, and susceptibility to respiratory tract infection, which may be caused by upregulated Th2 function [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These findings suggested that exposure to PM could modify the function of Th subgroups by epigenetic changes.</p><p>To assess the effects on gene expression at transcriptional level, we focused on methylation sites in the promoter regions and the first exon regions of the IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 genes to assess their effects on gene expression at transcriptional level, since the major determinants in the process of T cell differentiation are DNA methylation, DNA-binding proteins, histone acetylation, and transcription factor abundance, which act reciprocally. In the meantime, CpG site is located in the gene promoter region or nucleotide sensitive coding region, which affects gene transcription and can be found in the transcription factor binding sites [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our results showed that the mean methylation level of the IFN-&#x003b3; gene promoter region in the AR group was significantly higher than that of the control group. CpG<sup>&#x02013;299</sup>, CpG<sup>+119</sup> and CpG<sup>+168</sup> were significantly different, with transcription levels decreasing correspondingly. Previous studies demonstrated that increased DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) amounts could lead to passive methylation of IFN-&#x003b3; in Th2 polarization [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and DNA methylation of IFN-&#x003b3; could inhibit its expression for a long time and play an important role in the cell differentiation process in the polarization status of Th2 cells [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Until now, literature on the importance of the total percentage of CpG sites vs. a single CpG site in gene expression remains controversial.</p><p>To further evaluate the effect of methylation on the expression of cytokines genes, we calculated the correlations between quantitative cytokine mRNA expressions and the percentage of methylation in both groups. When all subjects were evaluated, a strong negative correlation between mRNA levels of the Th1 cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; and the percentage of methylation in the AR group was observed. This explanation is consistent with previous reports that DNA methylation in the promoter region of IFN-&#x003b3; is critical to its gene expression [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Other explanation was advocated that demethylation is needed to maintain IL-4 gene hypomethylation in Th1 cells [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, we found no significant change in the unmethylation of IL-4 in the patients, although cytokine mRNA expressions were increased remarkedly. These data suggest that methylation at selected positions has a stronger effect on IFN-&#x003b3; gene expression in pediatric AR.</p><p>Moreover, our findings demonstrate that exposure to activity-based dynamic PM<sub>2.5</sub> is associated with epigenetic changes of the methylation level in the IFN-&#x003b3; gene promoter region of the patients&#x02019; CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, which supports the hypothesis that ambient PM exposure may contribute to the persistence of AR symptoms. Several other researches emerged that provide additional evidence with respect to air pollution exposure. In animal models of allergy to Aspergillus through nasal route, we found that inhalation of diesel PM could alter DNA methylation levels of the two important genes IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 in allergic diseases, thereby increasing the secretion of total IgE and resulting in disease onset [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Tamar <italic>et al.</italic> assessed141 volunteers and found that exposure to air pollutant PM is significantly related to the methylation status of relevant genes involved in the pathways of asthma pathogenesis [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Salam <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] first reported that short time exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> is related to low NOS2 and FeNO methylation levels. Our results also suggest that dose-response relationships may exist for PM exposure and IFN-&#x003b3;. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b3; hypermethylation requires DNMT to catalyze and maintain its methylation status, acting on core sequences of the structural gene promoter to inhibit gene expression [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>There are several limitations in our current study. Firstly, the children&#x02019;s routine space-time path used in the dynamic exposure estimation is an approximate representation of mobility. An alternative activity time might have been derived if a different spatial and temporal resolution of grids in the model was used, which could affect individuals&#x02019; dynamic exposure assessments. Secondly, limited number of related allergic disease genes and CpG sites per gene were studied. The examination of genomic DNA and additional CpG sites may be beneficial to elucidating the mechanism of important epigenetic changes in airway inflammation. Thirdly, without examination of DNA methylation/gene expression in airway cells, it is still unclear how these biological changes in relation to PM<sub>2.5</sub> in blood samples would play a crucial role in airway inflammation, thus, further functional study would be helpful to validate these results. Lastly, we did not have additional blood tests over one-year time period to periodically demonstrate a &#x0201c;time course&#x0201d; change in the blood, which was due to several reasons. First, ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels were relatively lower compared to the occupational levels, which may take relatively long time to generate sizable adverse health effects. Some epigenetic impacts from chemical exposure may take one year or more to occur as well. Therefore, the study was designed to collect one time blood samples once at the end to investigate cumulative effects over one year time period. Secondly, feasibility of blood sample collection, especially in school children in our case, was very limited. Nonetheless, the most important strength of this study was its ability to examine the effect of long-term PM exposure on CpG methylation patterns of IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; promoter genes in CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in pediatric AR. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies showing the contributions of DNA methylation on allergic inflammation in PM mediated phenotype expression of AR.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our results demonstrate the critical role of DNA methylation of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in decreasing IFN-&#x003b3; gene mRNA expression in children with AR.
