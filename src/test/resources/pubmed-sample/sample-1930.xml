There are six known species of HCoV: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV and SARS-HCoV. Although studies have shown evidence of global distribution of HCoVs, there is limited information on their presence and distribution in Kenya.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>HCoV strains that circulated in Kenya were retrospectively diagnosed and molecularly characterized. A total of 417 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained between January 2009 and December 2012 from around Kenya were analyzed by a real time RT-PCR using HCoV-specific primers. HCoV-positive specimens were subsequently inoculated onto monolayers of LL-CMK2 cells. The isolated viruses were characterized by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the partial polymerase (<italic>po</italic>l) gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The prevalence of HCoV infection was as follows: out of the 417 specimens, 35 (8.4&#x000a0;%) were positive for HCoV, comprising 10 (2.4&#x000a0;%) HCoV-NL63, 12 (2.9&#x000a0;%) HCoV-OC43, 9 (2.1&#x000a0;%) HCoV-HKU1, and 4 (1&#x000a0;%) HCoV-229E. The Kenyan HCoV strains displayed high sequence homology to the prototypes and contemporaneous strains. Evolution analysis showed that the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 isolates were under purifying selection. Phylogenetic evolutionary analyses confirmed the identities of three HCoV-HKU1, five HCoV-NL63, eight HCoV-OC43 and three HCoV-229E.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>There were yearly variations in the prevalence and circulation patterns of individual HCoVs in Kenya. This paper reports on the first molecular characterization of human Coronaviruses in Kenya, which play an important role in causing acute respiratory infections among children.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Molecular characterization</kwd><kwd>Human coronaviruses</kwd><kwd>Prevalence</kwd><kwd>Kenya</kwd><kwd>HCOV-NL63</kwd><kwd>HCoV-OC43</kwd><kwd>HCoV-229E</kwd><kwd>HCoV-HKU1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Funding was provided by the US Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center Division of GEIS Operations</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of about 27&#x02013;32&#x000a0;kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They are round and sometimes pleiomorphic virions of approximately 80-120&#x000a0;nm in diameter. Their genome is the largest of all RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Coronaviruses share features of genome organization and replication strategy, but have different virion morphology and genome lengths. The 20&#x000a0;kb polymerase (<italic>pol</italic>) gene, which covers the 5&#x02032; two-thirds of the coronavirus genome, contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and ORF 1b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ORF 1b hosts the most highly conserved genomic sequences, encoding conserved functions such as polymerase and helicase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These functions combined with similarities in replication and expression strategies, exhibit an evolutionary link among coronaviruses, arteriviruses, and toroviruses, thus forming the rationale for placing these viruses in the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, the highly conserved structure and function of viral polymerases make the <italic>pol</italic> a logical region for making phylogenetic comparisons.</p><p>Coronaviruses cause various diseases in different hosts, such as respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and encephalomyelitis in birds and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Coronaviruses are classified into four distinct phylogenetic groups. Whereas alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses infect mammals, deltacoronaviruses infect avian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. All known human coronaviruses (HCoV) belong to the alphacoronavirus and betacoronaviruses. HCoV cause 30&#x000a0;% of common colds as well as severe infections in infants, children, and immunocompromised persons and the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. HCoVs have a worldwide circulation, with reports published in populations of different countries such as Saudi Arabia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] among others. However in 2012, a novel betacoronavirus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated in Jeddah from a patient who was suffering from pneumonia and later died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This MERS-CoV continues to cause fatal severe lower respiratory tract illnesses in various parts of the world, especially in the Middle East. As of February 2015, the World Health Organization had reported 971 laboratory confirmed cases with 356 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In light of the finding of this previously unknown coronavirus, it is probable that coronaviruses, other than those recognized to date, may be circulating in human populations in Kenya. As human coronaviruses are not routinely analyzed in Kenya, this study sought to identify and characterize HCoV strains circulating in different parts of Kenya and thus provide a knowledge base for epidemiological importance of human coronaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study sites, inclusion criteria, clinical parameters</title><p>Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens were retrieved from archives of the respiratory virus surveillance program in the Department of Emerging Infectious Diseases (DEID) of the United States Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya (USAMRU-K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These approximately 10000 archived NP specimens were collected from a study population comprising persons from two months of age onwards who attended outpatient clinics in the hospitals involved in the USAMRU-K respiratory virus surveillance; presenting with influenza like illnesses symptoms. These symptoms were: cough, sore throat, and fever (&#x02265;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) within 72&#x000a0;h after onset of illness. The nasoopharyngeal swabs were suspended in virus transport medium (VTM) and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. These samples had been screened for other respiratory viruses including influenza viruses, HAdV, RSV, HMPV, HSV1, rhinoviruses and non-polio enteroviruses including coxsackie viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The surveillance network comprised Mbagathi, Isiolo, Alupe, Kericho, Kisi, Malindi, and Port Reitz district hospitals, as well as the New Nyanza General provincial hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These hospitals represent disparate geographic regions and population demographics across the country and were delineated into Central, Northern, Western, Highlands and Coastal regions of Kenya, respectively. Inclusion criteria consisted of being an outpatient aged at least 2&#x000a0;months and having influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Clinical parameters and symptoms including recent history of ILI, cough, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, chills, nasal stuffiness, runny nose, sputum production, headache, joint pain, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding were documented. Only those samples collected from January 2009 to December 2012 for which specific consent was granted for future use were analyzed. The minimum sample size was 173 as determined by Fischer&#x02019;s formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Based on available resources, the final number of samples was determined by using the randomized sampling technique.

The majority (42&#x000a0;%) of the Kenyan isolates clustered within the HCoV-OC43 group, followed by HCoV-NL63 (26&#x000a0;%) and HCoV-HKUI &#x00026; HCoV-229E (16&#x000a0;% each). All the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 isolates formed a cluster on their own except isolate HCOV-016 which grouped with the other HCoV-OC43 viruses from other countries across the globe. The Kenyan HCoV-NL63 isolates clustered with other HCoV-NL63 viruses. The Kenyan HCoV-HKU1 isolates grouped close to the French virus whose accession number is EF507794 and the Kenyan HCoV-229E isolates were identical to the reference strains used.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic relationships of partial sequences from the HCoV <italic>pol</italic> gene of the Kenyan isolates with representatives from different species.

However, in Africa and especially sub-Saharan Africa, there is a dearth of information about these viruses in regard to their circulation dynamics, diversity, molecular characteristics and epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Four out of the six known human coronavirus species were detected by RT-PCR assay, which has been shown to detect respiratory viruses with high sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This finding echoes previous studies in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and globally where HCoVs were identified as significant etiological agents of ILI and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. HCoV-OC43 was the most commonly observed HCoV and this agrees with many previous studies that have reported HCoV-OC43 predominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. HCoV-NL63 contributed to 2&#x000a0;% of ILI cases in our study period. This finding echoes the findings in South Africa by Smuts, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] where they showed that HCoV-NL63, contributed to 2.4&#x000a0;% of ILI cases in the period of one and a half years. HCoV-229E contributed to 1&#x000a0;% of ILI cases in the study period, echoing results from other studies worldwide that show low detection of this HCoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is comparable to what has been observed globally, where HCoV activity is sporadic throughout the year with no obvious distinct seasonality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Overall, the symptoms associated with coronavirus infection were similar to what has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and it was difficult to distinguish an infection involving HCoV using symptoms alone. This justifies the WHO classification of respiratory viral infections into influenza-like-illnesses without clear distinction of a specific respiratory virus infection based on symptoms alone.</p><p>Out of 35 PCR-positive cases for HCoV, only 12 (34&#x000a0;%) yielded virus in LLCMK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and were confirmed by PCR. This was expected because molecular assays including PCR are more sensitive and specific at detecting pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] than cell culture or serology. The low isolation rate may be attributed to low viral loads in the patients or the presence of inactivated viruses, potentially due to poor specimen handling and/or storage. Nonetheless, this finding agrees with reports of poor growth and a lack of cytopathic effect in cell cultures by HCoVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the Kenyan isolates belonged to the <italic>alpha</italic> and <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Kenyan isolates clustered together with reference strains indicating that the Kenyan HCoVs are strain variants of those circulating elsewhere. Natural selection analyses revealed that the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 viruses were under negative selection, albeit not statistically significantly so. We did not detect any MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV.</p><p>This study had several shortcomings. The small sample size made it difficult to analyze evolutionary rates using the robust SLAC and FEL methods. Only a portion of the virus genome was analyzed and the evolution rates based on this small portion of the genome may be misleading. These shortcomings notwithstanding, it was demonstrated that four HCoV subtype strains were in circulation in Kenya from 2009 to 2012 and were similar to those circulating in other countries. However, sustained respiratory virus surveillance is necessary to monitor introductions of any of these dangerous species. Furthermore, full genome studies are required to provide comprehensive insight into the genetics and evolutionary characteristics of HCoVs in Kenya.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There were yearly variations in the prevalence and circulation patterns of individual HCoVs in Kenya.
