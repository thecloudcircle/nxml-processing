Approximately 5% of long-term follow-up SS patients develop malignant lymphoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that primary SS can be divided into 3 stages according to the extent of organ damage and the course of the disease. In stage I, (approximately 45% of SS cases), patients have only sicca syndrome without any other systemic involvement, even after 10 years. In stage II (approximately 50% of SS cases), patients have lymphocytic organ damage, which may involve the pulmonary, renal, hepatic, hematologic, and/or dermatologic systems, among others. In stage III (approximately 5% of SS cases), patients develop malignant lymphomas. Lymphomas in salivary glands are thought to arise from lymphoepithelial lesions in which there are close interactions between epithelial cells, T cells, and B cells. However, pathogenic line between lacrimal glands affected by SS and lypmphoma remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Cluster of differentiation (CD) 30, known as a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is highly expressed on malignant cells in organs affected by Hodgikin lymphoma (HL) or anaplastic large cell lypmphoma (ALCL).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Recently, CD30 has been thought to be implicated in an prognostic marker of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, we investigated the augmentation in the expression of CD30 in SS-affected lacrimal gland and conjunctival tissues and discussed the significance of our findings in SS patients in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients and disease control subjects</title><p>The research ethical committee at Keio University approved this study (#20090277). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Each patient has provided written informed consent for publication of the case. Lacrimal gland and conjunctival biopsies were applied to 3 patients with SS and 3 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) for diagnostic purposes, and the remaining tissues were examined for analytical purposes in this observational case series.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Clinical characteristics of these patients are shown in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Three female SS patients with a median age of 51 (range: 34&#x02013;61) and 3 female GVHD patients with a median age of 41 (range: 24&#x02013;47) were examined. At the time of biopsies, 5 patients (3 with SS and 2 with chronic GVHD) had severe dry eye. The diagnosis of SS was based on the Japanese Ministry of Health criteria revised in 1999.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Severe dry eye was determined by the Schirmer test with nasal stimulation equal or &#x0003c;10&#x0200a;mm, fluorescein scores of 3 or more out of 9 and rose bengal scores of 3 or more out of 9. Histological analyses of these tissues were conducted by the methods including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.

A panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies to CD4, CD8, CD30, IFN-&#x003b3; were used (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Briefly, consecutive 5-&#x003bc;m-thick frozen sections were air dried, fixed in acetone for 20&#x0200a;minutes at room temperature, and rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Nonspecific binding was inhibited by incubating the specimens with 5% normal rabbit serum for 30&#x0200a;minutes at room temperature. The sections were incubated with the optimally diluted primary antibody at room temperature for 2&#x0200a;hours, followed by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 45&#x0200a;minutes. The bound antibodies were visualized by the addition of diaminobenzidine tetrahydroxychloride. All steps were followed by 3 washes with PBS.

In contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in 3 patients with chronic GVHD-related dry eye disease. In lacrimal glands and conjunctiva in the 3 patients suffering from SS for more than 10 years, there were more B cell and plasma cell infiltrates than T cell infiltrates. IFN-&#x003b3; was expressed on endothelia in SS-affected lacrimal glands, whereas it was expressed on fibroblastic cells in their cGVHD-affected counterparts. CD30, a 120-kd transmembrane cytokine receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> is known as a ligand of CD153. It is reported that CD30 is expressed on a subset of activated lymphocytes.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> In addition, CD30 is a well-known diagnostic marker of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and primary effusion lymphoma<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> and a prognostic marker of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>In our study, marked mononuclear cell infiltration with CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells and Vs38c<sup>+</sup> plasma cells were observed, suggesting that various types of B lymphocyte lineage cells are accumulated excessively in SS lacrimal glands in long-term follow-up patients. It has been shown that autoimmune B cell activation plays a role in the initiation and propagation of SS by producing abnormal antibodies including interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, IL-4, a B cell activating factor and perpetuating chronic inflammation, and also contributes to the development of B cell lymphoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Our experiments indicated that IFN-&#x003b3; was expressed on endothelia of capillaries in lacrimal glands with SS, whereas the molecule was expressed on interstitial fibroblastic cells in those with GVHD. The expression of IFN-&#x003b3; is conceivably implicated in innate immunity in SS and contributes to aberrant activation of B cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> In addition, the abnormal activation of B cells is conceived to result in the uncontrolled production of IFN. By using genetic variations outside the MHC locus genes involved in type I interferon pathways, an animal study suggests that B- and T-cell methylation processes are associated with the development of both SS and SS-related lymphoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Excessive accumulation of B cells and plasma cells are presumed to produce abnormal antibodies in local microenvironments of SS-affected lacrimal glands. Abnormal antibodies may be harmful to lacrimal glands, and thereby lead to the initiation and perpetuation of SS and the development of lymphoma.</p><p>With regard to the significance of CD30 expression in lacrimal glands and conjunctiva with SS, lacrimal glands and conjunctiva are representative of exocrine glands (such as pancreas) and mucosal membranes (such as oral mucosa), respectively. CD30 has been recognized as a marker of the malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in HL.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Therefore, CD30<sup>+</sup> cells on the ocular surface and in lacrimal glands may be an important predictor of malignant lymphoma, and thereby great caution should be accorded to long-term follow-up SS patients.</p><p>CD30 is reportedly expressed on T cells, B cells, and eosinophils in association with the development of HL and ALCL.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> In our investigation into the pathology of SS, B cells are a candidate for expressing CD30. With respect to the malignancy of cells expressing CD30, a determinant of malignant cellular behavior is constitutive expression of CD30 or CD30 ligation. Constitutive CD30 expression is triggered by signal transduction of CD30. Thus, when CD30<sup>+</sup> cells exist in lacrimal glands and conjunctiva in SS patients without ML, neither constitutive CD30 expression nor CD30 ligation is presumably induced. However, the CD30<sup>+</sup> cells have the potential to become malignant.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Therefore, CD30 expression in SS lacrimal gland and conjunctiva may not be constitutive under nonmalignant condition.</p><p>A retrospective cohort study suggested that a focus score of &#x02265;3 in a labial salivary gland biopsy was an independent predictor of the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients with primary SS.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> In addition, a germ center-like structure could be referred to as a sign of developing malignant lymphoma in SS patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> It is conceivable that examination of excessive CD30 expression in lacrimal gland and conjunctival tissues may become an additional option to predict the initiation and propagation of ML.</p><p>In our study, where the severity of SS was determined based on Green Span classification, Case 2 and Case 3 had grade 3 and 4, respectively. In case 3, CD30-expressing cells with a germ center-like structure were observed. In this case, the germ center like region was closely associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells. The international set of classification criteria for primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> and the revised criteria for the diagnosis of SS proposed by the Japanese Ministry of Health 1999<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> have a subject for lip biopsy for diagnosing SS. It is advisable to detect the CD30 expression on the samples if possible.</p><p>There is several study limitations. Firstly, this is a human study with a small number of cases without normal controls due to ethical reason. Therefore, precise mechanistic insights of CD30 expression in SS lacrimal gland and conjunctiva cannot be elucidated. Secondly, we could not evaluate the frequency of CD30 expression in SS general population because of small sample size. Therefore, we should not overestimate our results and interpretation. Further study will be needed to confirm the phenotype of CD30<sup>+</sup> expressing cells whose shape is round or spindle. In addition, it will be required to show B cell or other cell phenotype which may develop malignant lymphoma. Unfortunately, we could not show those phenotypes due to limitation of our samples in this study.</p><p>Further study will be required to elucidate significance of CD30 expression and function in SS patients. Anti CD30 antibody is now available to treat ML. We need to confirm the effectiveness of anti CD30 antibody in SS using SS animal model or elucidate the function<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> and role of CD30 using CD30 knockout mice.</p><p>Approximately, 5% of SS patients are reported to develop ML.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Earlier work indicated that SS patients were 15 to 20 times more vulnerable to malignant lymphoma (ML) than those without SS.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Our novel study suggested that CD30<sup>+</sup> cells infiltrated lacrimal glands and conjunctiva in SS patients without ML, and therefore reinforced the previous reports. Collectively, clinical settings should accord great caution to the development of ML in patients with SS-related dry eye disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Kazuto Yamazaki for critical comments and suggestions, and Drs.
