We investigated whether <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection could promote gastric cancer by regulating lncRNAs expression. Differentially expressed lncRNAs between <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive and negative tissues were identified by microarray and validated by qRT-PCR. Our results indicated that <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive tissues have a specific profile of lncRNAs. Cell biological assays with siRNA-mediated knockdown or lentivirus vector-mediated over-expression were performed to probe the functional relevance of the lncRNAs. We identified an lncRNA-AF147447 decreased expressed by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, which can inhibit GC proliferation and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, act as a tumor suppressor in the development of <italic>H. pylori</italic> induced GC. LncRNA AF147447 could repress MUC2 expression by direct binding or increasing miR-34c expression. We also found that transcription factor E2F1 could be recruited to lncRNA AF147447 promoter by RNA immunoprecipatation and RNA pull down assays. These findings support a role of lncRNA AF147447 in tumor suppression. This discovery contributes to a better understanding of the importance of the deregulated lncRNAs by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and provides a rationale for the potential development of lncRNA-based targeted approaches for the treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-related gastric cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>helicobacter pylori infection</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>MUC2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gastric cancer (GC) belongs to the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A lot of risk factors contribute to GC, among which Helicobacter pylori (<italic>H. pylori</italic>) is the strongest one [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The rate of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is over 50% worldwide nowadays, especially among developing countries [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The mechanism considering how <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection induces GC has not been fully identified [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are a group of non-coding RNA transcripts which are longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Normally, they have little or no protein capacity. Like miRNAs, lncRNAs play important roles in regulating target gene expression, by transcription, posttranscriptional processing or epigenetically regulation, including binding with miRNA or chromatin modification and genomic imprinting [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and therefore, lncRNAs are associated with various diseases, such as metabolic disorders [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], cardiac diseases [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], tumors [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], etc.</p><p>Numerous studies have suggested the role of dysregulated lncRNA expression in GC. Zhang et al [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that lncRNA ANRIL was significantly upregulated in GC tissues. By recruiting and binding to PRC2, ANRIL epigenetically repress miR-99a/miR-449a, like ceRNAs, in controlling the targets-mTOR and CDK6/E2F1 pathway. Xu et al [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that lncRNA FENDRR expression was down-regulated in both GC cell lines and tissues and it could be considered as diagnostic and prognostic markers for GC patients. However, until now, no studies were performed regarding the dysregulated lncRNAs in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection-related GC.</p><p>In this study, we were the first to explore the dysregulated lncRNA expression in <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive tissues by lncRNA microarray. Our study showed that numbers of lncRNAs were dysregulated. We further investigated the detailed function of a <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection-related down-regulated lncRNA, AF147447, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and found that it plays an important role in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-related GC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Differential LncRNA Expressions were found in the gastric tissues of <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive and negative patients</title><p>We chose 3 matching pairs of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and non-infected gastric tissues for microarray analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs. We set a threshold as a fold change that is larger than 2.0 and a <italic>p value</italic> that is smaller than 0.05 and found that there were 123 dysregulated lncRNAs and 87 dysregulated mRNAs in the gastric tissues of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and non-infected patients, which means that the lncRNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>) and mRNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>) expression level were significantly different between the two groups. In order to validate microarray analysis findings, top ten lncRNAs from the differentially expressed lncRNAs were randomly selected with a fold change that is larger than 5 and detected their expressions by real time (RT)-PCR. The PCR validation data were the same as the microarray results (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for all). Consequently, our results suggested that a set of lncRNAs were frequently dysregulated in the gastric tissues of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and control patients and they may be related to the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-related carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>LncRNA AF147447 was decreased expressed in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected tissues and cells</title><p>Among the lncRNAs differentially expressed in tissues, we found that an lncRNA, accession number AF147447 in NCBI, was significantly decreased by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.

Consequently, we chose this lncRNA for further functional analysis and investigate potential mechanisms underlying <italic>H. pylori</italic> induced GC. In order to analyze <italic>in vitro</italic> whether <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection alters AF147447 expression, we measured AF147447 expression after <italic>H. pylori</italic> co-culture with GC cells. We found that AF147447 expression was decreased dose-dependently with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection MOIs in three gastric epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Then, we detected AF147447 expression in 75 pairs of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and non-infected tissues and 50 pairs of tumor tissues by qRT-PCR. The basic characteristics of enrolled patients were shown (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and the results showed that AF147447 was significantly decreased when <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected, regardless of control or tumor tissues. Additionally, we also found out that the expression of AF147447 was significantly decreased in tumor tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). When compared its expression with clinical characteristics, we found that patients with intestinal metaplasia expressed significantly lower AF147447 compared with superficial gastritis or atrophic gastritis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), which suggested that the more severe the histology of the patients is, the lower AF147447 expressed. In 50 pairs of tumor tissues, we found that patients with advanced stages showed significantly lower AF147447 expression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We next examined AF147447 expression in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected gastric tissues in mice. Infected mice lasted for one year yielded the lowest AF147447 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), which showed that AF147447 expression was decreased both time dependently and dose dependently with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>LncRNA AF147447 expression in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected state</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AF147447 expression in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected cells compared with controls.

Thus, we investigated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by decreasing or increasing AF147447 expression. Firstly, we examined the expression of AF147447 in 5 gastric epithelial cells. We found that AF147447 expression was lowest in 7901 and highest in MKN45 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). Consequently, we chose 7901 to over-express AF147447 and MKN45 to reduce AF147447 expression. 3 siRNAs were used to interfere with AF147447 expression and siRNA2 showed the highest inhibition rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We chose siRNA2 for further functional analysis. From CCK8 analysis, we found that suppression of AF147447 greatly enhanced cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Also, AF147447 inhibition also promoted GC cells invasion activity compared with controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

In order to validate the relationship between AF147447 and MUC2, luciferase reporter assay was performed with MUC2 promoter region. LncRNA AF147447 could combine with MUC2 promoter region through sequence match (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The target sequence of the mutant (mt) or wild type (wt) promoter was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector. We then transfected the cells with wt/mt vector together with lncRNA AF147447.

However, the luciferase activity of mt vector remained the same after a simultaneous transfection with AF147447.</p><p>Then, the functional relevance between lncRNA AF147447 and MUC2 was determined. LncRNA AF147447 could inhibit or promote cell proliferation and invasion through targeting and changing the expression of MUC2. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured the RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) expression levels of MUC2 by qRT-PCR and western blot in 7901 cells with AF147447 overexpression or decreased expression. We found that MUC2 expression was markedly decreased in the cells stably transfected with pLV-AF147447 than that with pLV-NC, and was significantly increased transfecting with AF147447 siRNA compared with those transfecting with the siRNA control. These results suggested that AF147447 could inhibit MUC2 RNA and protein expression.</p><p>We also determined MUC2 RNA and protein levels after cells infected with different density of <italic>H. pylori</italic> bacteria.

Then, we detected its expression both in 75 pairs of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and non-infected tissues and 50 pairs of tumor tissues by qRT-PCR. The results showed that MUC2 expression was markedly higher in infected gastric tissues, especially in infected tumor tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Immunohistochemistry analysis also suggested that MUC2 expression was up-regulated in the infected tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We selected 15 tissues and detected AF147447 and MUC2 expression respectively. From pearson correlation analysis, we could conclude that MUC2 expression was negatively correlated with AF147447 (r = &#x02212;0.864, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>MUC2 expression under <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected state</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MUC2 mRNA expression in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected cells compared with controls.

Firstly, we searched from miRanda database and found that miR-34c might be one regulatory gene of MUC2. We constructed luciferase gene and found that miR-34c mimic transfection significantly reduced the luciferase activity, which confirmed that MUC2 is miR-34c target gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). By searching online databases, including PicTar, miRbase and BiBi Serv, the co-regulation of miRNA with lncRNA AF147447 was predicted by the bioinformatics analysis. The binding of miR-34c with lncRNA AF147447 was confirmed with the luciferase reporter assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

We next examined the expression level of AF147447 after transfecting with miR-34c mimic or inhibitor. AF147447 was higher when miR-34c over-expressed and vice versa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). We also examined miR-34c expression after lncRNA-AF147447 overexpressed and down-regulated and found that miR-34c was significantly higher when lncRNA AF147447 overexpressed and vice versa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).

Besides MUC2, EGFR and CD44 were also predicted to be miR-34c targets.

Taken together, these results demonstrated that lncRNA could regulate MUC2 expression not only by directing binding, but also through post-transcriptional pathway, such as regulating miRNA expression.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>LncRNA-AF147447 interact with increased miR-34c expression level</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of MUC2 3&#x02032;UTR region constructs.

Recent studies have reported that transcription factors can bind to the promoter region of target lncRNAs and inhibit their expression. We wondered whether down-expression of AF147447 was mediated by this transcriptional factor. Firstly, to validate whether E2F1 could recruit to AF147447 promoter region and direct interaction of lncRNA AF147447 with E2F1, we performed RIP-qPCR and the results demonstrated that the lncRNA AF147447 RIP is significantly enriched for E2F1 compared to IgG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The association between lncRNA AF147447 and E2F1 was further validated by luciferase reporter analysis. We constructed AF147447 wt and mut promoter and found that lncRNA AF147447 transfection could significantly reduce the luciferase activity, which could be reversed by si-E2F1 co-transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Next, we investigated the functional association between E2F1 and lncRNA AF147447. After transfecting with si-E2F1, we found that lncRNA AF147447 was significantly over-expressed while transfecting with pcDNA-E2F1, lncRNA AF147447 was significantly reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), which suggested that E2F1 could change lncRNA AF147447 expression. We further examined whether E2F1 transfection could alter target gene MUC2 expression and found that MUC2 was significantly lower when si-E2F1 transfected and higher when pcDNA-E2F1 transfected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). We then validated the correlation between E2F1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> with lncRNA AF147447 and MUC2. The results showed that E2F1 expression was negatively correlated with lncRNA AF147447 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>) and positively correlated with MUC2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>LncRNA AF147447 physically associates with E2F1</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RIP experiments were performed using the E2F1 antibody to immunoprecipitate (IP) and a primer to detect lncRNA-AF147447.

Therefore, lncRNA AF147447 plays an important role in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection-related GC. We also found that lncRNA AF147447 was markedly decreased in GC and was further decreased in <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive GC. By applying gain-of-function and loss-of-function methods, lncRNA AF147447 was identified to significantly inhibit cell proliferation and invasion. Additionally, it was shown that the expression of lncRNA AF147447 was regulated by E2F1 and oncogene MUC2 was a direct target of AF147447. It can also been found that AF147447 could post-transcriptionally affect MUC2 expression by binding with miR-34c.</p><p>GC is a worldwide malignant disease with a high incidence, high recurrence and poor prognosis, especially in Southeast Asia [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Significant proportion of the GC patients was <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected. Consequently, comprehensively study the mechanism and then develop new targeted treatments for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection related GC was indeed necessary. Epigenetic modification belongs to one of the many characteristics of early process of tumorigenesis, changing the surrounding microenvironment to form a tumor [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Protein coding and non-protein coding genes (microRNA, lncRNA, circRNA) dysregulation has been identified to be able to diagnosing and predicting GC patients' prognosis [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, whether <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection could promote GC through lncRNA regulation has not been previously elucidated. In the present study, we found that patients with the severe histology had much lower lncRNA AF147447 expression than normal controls. Previous reports showed that deregulated lncRNAs in GC could also be used as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Detecting the expression level of these lncRNAs, in combination with lncRNA AF147447 and even protein-coding genes or miRNAs, may be valuable to predict the prognosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> related patients more accurately [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, like some other lncRNAs, for example M86523 identified in our microarray analysis, are also suggested to be differentially expressed in positive and negative tissues, we will next determine whether deregulation of these lncRNAs also correlates with the histology of the patients and whether detecting these lncRNAs together is more precise in identifying the prognosis of GC patients [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We further examined the role of AF147447 <italic>in vitro</italic> and we found that AF147447 could inhibit tumor proliferation and invasion. We then explored that GC cells with over-expression or down-regulation of AF147447 might play a critical role in tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, an RNA pull-down assay syggested that AF147447 was able to combine with transcription factor E2F1 and its expression level was mediated by E2F1. E2F1 was a transcription factor which over-expressed by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Transcription factor could combine with the promoter of the gene and suppress its expression [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We have also identified a target gene, MUC2, as affected by AF147447 down-regulation. The mucin core proteins (MUCs) are glycosylated proteins expressed in tissue-specific patterns in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been found over-expressed in various cancers, such as colorectal cancer [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], ovarian cancer [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. MUC2 over-expression is an adverse prognostic factor in cancers [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The regulatory role of MUC2 in tumor progression suggests that MUC2 could be considered as a new diagnostic marker for cancer diagnosis and a new drug target for the cancer therapy [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also found that lncRNA AF147447 could regulate MUC2 expression by regulating miR-34c expression. From pearson correlation analysis, we found that miR-34c and lncRNA AF147447 was positively correlated in tissues. Besides, lncRNA AF147447 transfection could alter miR-34c expression and vice versa.</p><p>As some studies have shown that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection could change the expression of certain kinds of lncRNA [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], our current study is one of the important supplements to the <italic>H. pylori</italic> related carcinogenesis, which provided a brand new lncRNA diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for GC.
