For delivery at term the cervix must soften, shorten and fully dilate during the latent first and second stage of labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Cervical length, cervical consistency or softness, and cervical dilatation are three clinical parameters used to describe cervical ripening throughout pregnancy and to predict time of delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Softening is related to changes in collagen content and organization, structural cervical changes, an increase of water content, and concentration of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Cervical softening can already be detected in the first month after fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and continues progressively throughout pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], while cervical length remains stable until it gradually shortens during the third trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Cervical dilatation generally starts with labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], with delivery being preceded by complete cervical softening, shortening and dilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Predicting timing of delivery plays an important role in prenatal care. Anticipating whether a birth may occur preterm allows for clinical interventions that can delay prematurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], or accelerate fetal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and currently this assessment relies heavily on determining the length of the cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Timing the delivery can also be relevant in the success of induction of labor. Presently, clinicians assess cervical maturation using the Bishop Score to determine the need for cervical ripening prior to induction. A softer, shorter and more dilated cervix is associated with a shorter time to labor onset, as well as a smaller risk for a failed induction and a cesarean section due to cervical dystocia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] Cervical dystocia happens when the cervical ripening does not occur at term and the cervix does not shorten and dilate. If, however, cervical ripening occurs too fast (cervical incompetence) there is a higher risk for preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Ultimately, more accurately predicting delivery timing can reduce levels of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The ability of the cervix to fulfil its different roles throughout pregnancy is fundamental to ensure a timely and successful delivery, and therefore there is strong clinical interest in evaluating its condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">By digitally palpating the cervix during a pelvic exam, cervical status can be evaluated by its tissue stiffness, its length and its dilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. With the introduction of ultrasound, cervical length and cervical dilation to an extent became objectively quantifiable parameters for estimating the risk of preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Cervical softness, however, remained a subjective evaluation by the obstetrician or the midwife, dependent on the experience of the examiner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is no well-established objective technique to assess the cervical softness during pregnancy. Different ultrasound-based elastography methods have lately been applied in clinical trials to study cervical stiffness in pregnancy. However, these methods have shortcomings, namely the characterization of the applied force, leading to operator dependency, or the limitations on the assumptions made about the biomechanical properties of the cervical tissue, which do not allow a clear interpretation of the results, leading to a lack of a clear cut-off value for predicting preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In this study, we compare inter-observer and intra-observer variability of two methods to assess cervical stiffness: i) digital palpation, and ii) a new device based on the aspiration technique (Pregnolia System).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par12">For this study, five silicone models of the uterine cervix were used to simulate different cervical stiffnesses.

A Plexiglas cylinder (outer diameter 30&#x02009;mm, inner diameter 26&#x02009;mm and height 50&#x02009;mm), inserted in the mold served as support for the silicone cervix (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and c).</p><p id="Par17">The silicone was then cured for at least 2 h at room temperature.

A cervix classified as medium can vary from ~&#x02009;70 to ~&#x02009;230&#x02009;mbar. A soft cervix can have a stiffness in the range of ~&#x02009;35 to ~&#x02009;150&#x02009;mbar.

The method is subjective, but, to our knowledge, reliability has never been quantified. Results reported in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> clearly show that digital palpation is not a sufficiently reproducible method, since different participants assessed the stiffness of the same cervices differently. Furthermore, this method is also not reliably repeatable, since when the same participants were asked to assess the stiffness of the same cervix, only 24% did not change their previous assessment at all. 44% of the participants changed the assessment at least once and 5% changed the assessment of all three the repeated cervices. Furthermore, when analyzing the aggregate data, it is patently observable that each of the traditional descriptors encompasses a wide range of actual stiffnesses, with intermediate stiffness levels being in fact described as soft, medium and stiff.</p><p id="Par40">On the contrary, the aspiration technique-based device is a repeatable and reproducible method to assess the cervical stiffness, as demonstrated by the extremely low relative standard deviation calculated and the results reported in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The results also show the possibility of distinguishing much smaller differences in tissue stiffness compared to digital palpation, which poorly differentiates close stiffness values. This new technique could help obstetricians and midwives assess cervical stiffness in an objective and repeatable way without the need to rely on their own judgment.</p><p id="Par41">Noteworthy, the aspiration technique-based device requires the use of a speculum during the examination, contrary to digital palpation. Speculum application is a common practice in the field of gynecology and obstetrics. Speculum-based examinations may be unpleasant for the women, however, also digital palpation may lead to discomfort and embarrassment for the woman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Interestingly, a few participants commented that the stiffest cervix model, with the equivalent stiffness corresponding to gestational weeks 5&#x02013;8, was, in their opinion, not representative of a stiff cervix. This can also be seen in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>: the majority of the changes were from a lower to a stiffer value, as both obstetricians and midwives initially judged the models softer than what they did at the end, after assessing several models. As reported by Badir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], a cervix of a non-pregnant woman can be more than twice as stiff as <italic>cervix</italic> 1, but we deliberately chose not to create a stiffer cervix since the Bishop score method was initially developed to assess the stiffness of women close to labor, when the cervix is very soft (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, weeks 36&#x02013;40 of gestation). Given the fact that the division among stiff, medium and soft is made close to labor, we anticipated that a stiffness of ~&#x02009;220&#x02009;mbar, corresponding to a cervix at gestational weeks 5&#x02013;8, would be far stiffer than what is normally assessed by digital palpation in women close to labor.</p><p id="Par43">The strength of the study lies in the innovative, reproducible non-invasive method for analyzing cervical consistency and the large number of participants assessing cervical stiffness. However, the primary limitation of this study is due to the fact that stiffness was measured on silicone models and not in vivo on actual cervices. Cervical tissue in pregnancy is not homogenous in the anterior and posterior part and depends on maternal factors (parity, weight, age). While there is no reason to believe that human operator objectiveness would increase in vivo<italic>,</italic> these conclusions would gain by the performance of a similar study in vivo, where the performance of the device in real tissue can be measured. Due to this fact, we cannot directly compare this method to Bishop score, or assess outcome prediction. Furthermore, the device does not analyze the full depth of the cervical tissue, however previous comparison to a method that&#x000a0;measures tissue stiffness on the whole cervix showed equivalent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Some of the participants reported that the models feel different from real cervices, noting that there is no mucus and the shape of the model cervix is only partially representative of the real one, preventing them from palpating the lateral side of the cervix. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, the stiffness of the silicone models is representative of the physiological cervices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">This study has shown that an aspiration technique-based device provides obstetricians and midwives with a method for objectively and repeatably assessing uterine cervical stiffness, eliminating sole reliance on subjective interpretations from digital palpation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CSI</term><def><p id="Par5">Cervical stiffness index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>P<sub>cl</sub></term><def><p id="Par6">Closing pressure</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Sabrina Badir and Laura Bernardi contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the participants who assessed the stiffness of the silicone cervices and Marlene Bissig for helping in conducting the study.
