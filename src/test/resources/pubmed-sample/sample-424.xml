The <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> iron regulated open reading frame (ORF) <italic>rv3402c</italic>, encoding a conserved hypothetical protein, was shown to be up-regulated upon infection in both human and mice macrophages. To explore the function of this ORF, we heterologously expressed the <italic>rv3402c</italic> gene in the non-pathogenic fast-growing <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> strain, and demonstrated that Rv3402c, a cell envelope-associated protein, was able to enhance the intracellular survival of recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Enhanced growth was not found to be the result of an increased resistance to intracellular stresses, as growth of the Rv3402c expressing strain was unaffected by iron depletion, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, or acidic conditions. Colonization of macrophages by <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> expressing Rv3402c was associated with substantial cell death and significantly greater amount of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; compared with controls. Rv3402c-induced TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; production was found to be mediated by NF-&#x003ba;B, ERK and p38 pathway in macrophages. In summary, our study suggests that Rv3402c delivered in a live <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> vehicle can modify the cytokines profile of macrophage, promote host cell death and enhance the persistence of mycobacterium within host cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation (grant numbers 81371851, 81071316, 81271882), National Megaprojects for Key Infectious Diseases (grant numbers 2008ZX10003-006, 2012ZX10003-003), New Century Excellent Talents in Universities (grant number NCET-11-0703), Excellent PhD thesis fellowship of Southwest University (grant numbers kb2010017, ky2011003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Nos.

Despite intense efforts to mitigate its toll on humanity, TB was still responsible for 1.3 million deaths, and caused 8.6 million new and relapse infections in 2012 (World Health Organization Tuberculosis Data and Statistics, 2013). In addition, the emergence of drug resistant Mtb strains and co-infection with HIV further highlighted the necessity of novel TB medications informed by in-depth understanding of Mtb biology.</p><p>Upon internalization by macrophages, Mtb is widely assumed to be confined within the phagosome, a specialized vacuole derived from the plasma membrane. Subsequently, the phagosome matures through fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes, creating an inhospitable environment for invading microorganisms, that includes phagosomal acidification, elevated levels of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), charged antimicrobial peptides <xref rid="pone.0094418-Flannagan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and iron deprivation <xref rid="pone.0094418-DeVoss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Several mycobacterial secreted virulence factors have been well defined in the process of inhibiting phagosomal maturation, and such knowledge will unveil previously unknown host signaling pathways involved in the innate immunity against Mtb infection, which will lead to the development of more effective vaccines and drugs.</p><p>Our data suggests that the Rv3402c protein might play a role in intracellular survival of recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> by modulating the host innate immune response. <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, a non-pathogenic mycobacterium species, does not multiply and is readily killed by the macrophage, enabling this bacteria to be an ideal surrogate for the identification of virulence factors implicated in intracellular survival <xref rid="pone.0094418-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Pelosi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Daim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Kuprash2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Dheenadhayalan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Nair1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Delogu1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Lagier1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Iantomasi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. We found that <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> recombinant strain expressing Rv3402c showed enhanced survival both in the U-937 and the RAW264.7 cultures <italic>in vitro</italic> and impaired the viability of U-937. These results were not observed in the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> strain containing the vector only. Since these two recombinant strains show the same growth kinetics in axenic culture or other stress conditions, the enhanced intracellular survival in macrophages of MS_Rv3402c was thought to be the result of the protein's interference with the innate immune response. Differences in viability between the U-937 and RAW264.7 cells infected with MS_3402c was possibly due to the inherent differences between mouse and human macrophages. For example, the Mtb <italic>ptpA</italic> deletion mutant was described to have reduced virulence in THP-1 cells <xref rid="pone.0094418-Bach1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, the same mutant was not found to have reduced survival in a mouse infection model <xref rid="pone.0094418-Grundner1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Thus, definitive identification of the role of Rv3402c in these two models will require further functional studies which are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Despite recent evidence of the role of <italic>rv3402c</italic> in the interaction of recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and host cells, the function of Rv3402c remains unknown. According to the TubercuList website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/index.html">http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/index.html</ext-link>), <italic>rv3402c</italic> encodes a conserved hypothetical protein. Rv3402c is predicted to be engaged in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-like molecules, and its sequence shows &#x0003e;40% sequence similarity to three types of enzymes: an aminotransferase, a dehydratase and an enzyme involved in perosamine/O-antigen biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0094418-Gold1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Moreover, using the NCBI BLAST server we found that <italic>rv3402c</italic> encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and a putative PLP-dependent enzyme from <italic>Rheinheimera sp</italic>., which is predicted to be involved in cell wall biogenesis. We therefore tested whether Rv3402c was altered the cell surface properties. We found that the overexpression in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> of Rv3402c, which is found in the cell envelope of mycobacteria, does not impact on colony morphology (data not shown). Furthermore, bacterial fatty acids compositions of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> was not affected by the overexpression of Rv3402c protein (data not shown).</p><p>Although the physiologic function of Rv3402c is poorly understood, based on the subcellular fractionation analysis in this study, this protein deserved to be investigated for its role as a membrane- or cell wall-associated components. In order to avoid the bias of plasmid pNIT-Myc-Rv3402c, we chose another widely used plasmid pALACE to perform proteinase K and trypsin sensitivity assays. These assays performed on live recombinant mycobacterial strains revealed that His-tagged Rv3402c protein is partly exposed on the surface of mycobacteria. Not surprisingly, there are many proteins detected both in the cytoplasm and cell envelope, such as Rv2224c <xref rid="pone.0094418-Rengarajan2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, Rv0132c <xref rid="pone.0094418-Bashiri1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, Eis <xref rid="pone.0094418-Dahl1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> PknI <xref rid="pone.0094418-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <italic>et al</italic>. Together, these results provide evidence that the Rv3402c protein is present on the surface of mycobacteria and may be available for interaction with host components.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1;, a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine, is essential for host protective immunity to contain <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0094418-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Roach1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Compared to pathogenic mycobacteria, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is a potent inducer of TNF-&#x003b1; in macrophages <xref rid="pone.0094418-Roach2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, consistent with the elevated TNF-&#x003b1; levels in the supernatant of macrophages infection with MS_Vec instead of the non-infected groups. Elevated levels of TNF-&#x003b1; was regarded as one culprit for Mtb persistence and virulence within human macrophages <xref rid="pone.0094418-Dheenadhayalan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that mycobacterial components can enhance the production of TNF-&#x003b1; in monocytes/macrophages <xref rid="pone.0094418-Dheenadhayalan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Other studies have shown that virulent growth of Mtb in human monocytes <xref rid="pone.0094418-Byrd1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094418-Silver1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> or alveolar macrophages <xref rid="pone.0094418-Engele1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> is associated with enhanced secretion of TNF, as well as cytotoxicity. This evidence may provide insight into the role of TNF in cytolysis and the enhanced survival of the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> strain expressing Rv3402c. Finally, through the pharmacological inhibition experiments, we found that the NF-&#x003ba;B, ERK and p38 pathways are required for Rv3402c-induced TNF-&#x003b1; expression by macrophages. However, only the NF-&#x003ba;B and ERK1/2 pathways are required for Rv3402c-induced IL-1&#x003b2; expression and protein production. It is our observation that Rv3402c disrupts host signal transduction in an alternative manner, which ultimately enables the bacteria to subvert the host immune response.</p><p>In summary, the present study suggests that the expression of the Rv3402c protein in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> provides the bacteria specific properties that enhance intracellular persistence, decrease viability and modify the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages. This might provide novel information in the complex interplay between the host and Mtb. A greater understanding of the effect of Rv3402c on host signaling pathways will enhance our knowledge of Mtb pathogenesis. Further experiments such as using Mtb knockout mutant to determine the precise function of Rv3402c during infection are worthwhile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Yossef Av-Gay for providing facilities with the proteinase K and trypsin sensitivity assays.
