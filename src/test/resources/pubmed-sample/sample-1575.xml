We aimed to use machine-learning approaches to characterise the immune cell profile of patients with juvenile-onset SLE and investigate links with the disease trajectory over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study included patients who attended the University College London Hospital (London, UK) adolescent rheumatology service, had juvenile-onset SLE according to the 1997 American College of Rheumatology revised classification criteria for lupus or the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria, and were diagnosed before 18 years of age. Blood donated by healthy age-matched and sex-matched volunteers who were taking part in educational events in the Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology Versus Arthritis at University College London (London, UK) was used as a control. Immunophenotyping profiles (28 immune cell subsets) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with juvenile-onset SLE and healthy controls were determined by flow cytometry. We used balanced random forest (BRF) and sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) to assess classification and parameter selection, and validation was by ten-fold cross-validation. We used logistic regression to test the association between immune phenotypes and k-means clustering to determine patient stratification. Retrospective longitudinal clinical data, including disease activity and medication, were related to the immunological features identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Sept 5, 2012, and March 7, 2018, peripheral blood was collected from 67 patients with juvenile-onset SLE and 39 healthy controls. The median age was 19 years (IQR 13&#x02013;25) for patients with juvenile-onset SLE and 18 years (16&#x02013;25) for healthy controls. The BRF model discriminated patients with juvenile-onset SLE from healthy controls with 90&#x000b7;9% prediction accuracy. The top-ranked immunological features from the BRF model were confirmed using sPLS-DA and logistic regression, and included total CD4, total CD8, CD8 effector memory, and CD8 naive T cells, Bm1, and unswitched memory B cells, total CD14 monocytes, and invariant natural killer T cells. Using these markers patients were clustered into four distinct groups. Notably, CD8 T-cell subsets were important in driving patient stratification, whereas B-cell markers were similarly expressed across the cohort of patients with juvenile-onset SLE. Patients with juvenile-onset SLE and elevated CD8 effector memory T-cell frequencies had more persistently active disease over time, as assessed by the SLE disease activity index 2000, and this was associated with increased treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and an increased prevalence of lupus nephritis. Finally, network analysis confirmed the strong association between immune phenotype and differential clinical features.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Machine-learning models can define potential disease-associated and patient-specific immune characteristics in rare disease patient populations.

The earliest referenced article was published in 1993; however, due to the modern computational analytical techniques used in this paper, the majority of articles referenced were more recent (since 2016). We found that in-depth computational analysis of multi-omic datasets has accelerated the understanding of complex heterogeneous diseases such as SLE and juvenile-onset SLE.

This approach can overcome difficulties in obtaining validation datasets because the model does not overfit to training data. Validation was by ten-fold cross-validation. We used logistic regression to assess the association between immunophenotypes (28 parameters) and juvenile-onset SLE. Important parameters identified by all analysis approaches were selected and used for patient stratification by k-means clustering; for this analysis, immunological parameters fulfilling the following criteria were selected: top ten important variables in BRF model; top ten weighting variables in sPLS-DA analysis; and parameters significantly associated with juvenile-onset SLE in logistic regression analysis. Clinical trajectory analysis was used to identify the clinical difference between patient groups. Demographic variables, including sex, age, and ethnicity, were adjusted for as appropriate. ANOVA was done in GraphPad Prism 8 software, and other statistical analyses was done in R (version 3.5.2).

Expanded CD8 memory T cells have been associated with poor disease outcome measures when combined with transcriptional profiling in adults with SLE.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Previous research suggested that CD8 EM T cells have decreased proliferative capacity and a strong inclination towards apoptosis in SLE, while expressing high levels of interferon-&#x003b3;, granzyme B, and perforin, thus potentially contributing to chronic inflammation and organ damage.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, the mechanisms driving increased memory CD8 T cells in juvenile-onset SLE remain uncertain and require further investigation.</p><p id="para350">This study has some limitations. As disease in the majority of our patients with juvenile-onset SLE was reasonably well controlled by medication, investigation of severely active juvenile-onset SLE phenotype was not possible. Furthermore, SLEDAI-2K, as all disease activity scores, is an imperfect measure of changes in disease severity; however, despite its limitations, the SLEDAI-2K score is widely used in clinical practice to guide therapeutic decisions and define SLE activity categories and was applied consistently when assessing the patients longitudinally. Notably, mycophenolate mofetil doses were significantly elevated in group 1, and this elevation was probably a reflection of the higher disease activity in group 1 patients than in patients in groups 2&#x02013;4. Furthermore, although longitudinal clinical data were collected, we cannot account for patient non-compliance to prescribed therapy (eg, mycophenolate mofetil levels were not tested), which could affect the analysis comparing phenotype with disease outcomes and treatment. In addition, no organ-specific immune analysis was done because of practical reasons. Children and adolescents with juvenile-onset SLE are diagnosed on the basis of expert opinion and classified using adult-tailored classification criteria (the American College of Radiology and SLICC classification criteria). This approach can pose considerable challenges in diagnosing patients with atypical presentations. As a consequence, many patients with juvenile-onset SLE are initially labelled as having arthritis or myositis, which have been identified as manifestations of juvenile-onset SLE. For this reason, we have not excluded patients with a concomitant diagnosis of arthritis or myositis from this study. Another characteristic of this juvenile-onset SLE cohort was the small number of patients with black ethnicity within this cohort and specifically within group 1; ethnicity could play a part in altered immune cell phenotype between the groups, as has been shown previously.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The imbalance in the sex and ethnicity between healthy controls and patients with juvenile-onset SLE is a practical problem limited by the willingness of adolescent healthy donors to participate in research. Furthermore, machine-learning algorithms function like a black box that produces reasonable prediction results without giving complementary justification. Thus, it would be important for this analysis to be validated in external cohorts and done on a cohort by cohort basis to account for ethnicity changes between regions or countries and to prospectively validate the association between immune cell subsets and disease progression.</p><p id="para360">In conclusion, the application of machine-learning approaches to immune phenotyping data has identified immunological biomarkers that could potentially help to unravel underlying disease mechanisms in juvenile-onset SLE and explain the differences in long-term outcomes of patients with this disease. Such immunological signatures could facilitate better stratification of patients for optimal treatment choices and provide information to improve interventional clinical trial design.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
