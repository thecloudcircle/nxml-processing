Previous studies have shown transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling can determine intracellular fluxes that correlate highly with <sup>13</sup>C-MFA measured fluxes and can achieve higher accuracy than constraint-based metabolic modeling alone. These studies, however, used validation data limited to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> grown on glucose, with significantly similar flux distribution for central metabolism. It is unclear whether those results apply to more diverse metabolisms, and therefore further, extensive validation is needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>In this paper, we formed a dataset of transcriptomic data coupled with corresponding <sup>13</sup>C-MFA flux data for 21 experimental conditions in different unicellular organisms grown on varying carbon substrates and conditions. Three computational flux-balance analysis (FBA) methods were comparatively assessed. The results show when uptake rates of carbon sources and key metabolites are known, transcriptomic data provides no significant advantage over constraint-based metabolic modeling (average correlation coefficients, transcriptomic E-Flux2 0.725 and SPOT 0.650 vs non-transcriptomic pFBA 0.768). When uptake rates are unknown, however, predictions obtained utilizing transcriptomic data are generally good and significantly better than those obtained using constraint-based metabolic modeling alone (E-Flux2 0.385 and SPOT 0.583 vs pFBA 0.237). Thus, transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling is a promising method to obtain intracellular flux estimates in microorganisms, particularly in cases where uptake rates of key metabolites cannot be easily determined, such as for growth in complex media or <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1515511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Min Kyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by NSF award no. 1515511 (MKK).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec003"><title>Introduction</title><p>Computational tools integrating transcriptomic data into genome-scale metabolic models can predict system-level and condition specific metabolic flux distributions. Many methods for inferring metabolic fluxes from gene expression data have been, and continue to be, developed [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the comparative performance of these methods lacks diverse experimental flux data for validation. Existing validation was performed exclusively against flux data generated from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) cultures grown on glucose as the sole carbon source [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cells cultured on identical substrates utilize highly similar metabolic pathways [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This carbon source bias presents significant similarities in the measured metabolic flux distribution across previous validation datasets which may have been inadequate in assessing predictive performance.</p><p>Carbon source availability and relative uptake rates influence cellular metabolism. In nature, heterotrophic microorganisms can encounter a wide set of possible carbon sources to support growth, including sugars, polyols, alcohols, organic acids, and amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Heterotrophs such as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> have been widely studied and cultured on a variety of substrates including monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose, galactose), disaccharides (e.g. sucrose), and two-carbon compounds (e.g. acetate) [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, under a multitude of possible carbon sources, an incorrectly constrained heterotrophic model can reduce the predictive accuracy of central carbon fluxes from conventional FBA methods. Gene expression may be useful to impute model constraints based on transcript abundance in the absence of specific carbon source and uptake rate data.</p><p>Growth condition encompasses the availability of metabolic state-determining metabolites, both organic and inorganic (e.g. glucose, CO<sub>2</sub>, photons, NO<sub>3</sub>). Missing or incorrect growth condition information can change flux predictions to alternate metabolic states of the cell. Photoautotrophic unicellular metabolic models are generally well characterized and therefore simpler to constrain with respect to carbon source. The depletion of non-carbon metabolites may metabolically adapt the cell to alternate metabolic states. For example, light inhibition can shift metabolism from either autotrophic, heterotrophic, or a combination of both as mixotrophic in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A substrate void of nitrate can induce replenishing of nitrogen from metabolic sinks such as amino acids for <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. PCC 7002 [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the lack of environmental condition specificity, informational deficit may be overcome with gene expression data such as key pathways being allocated flux values based on the upregulation of associated transcripts.</p><p>Previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238689.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] have extensively evaluated the predictive capability of <italic>in silico</italic> flux prediction using measured extracellular and intracellular fluxes in multiple experimental conditions, but under single carbon source bias (glucose) in two organisms. To address the limitations of the previous dataset, we have compiled an additional 21 experimental conditions of transcriptome measurements coupled with corresponding central carbon metabolic intracellular <sup>13</sup>C flux measurements in 4 organisms (8 in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, 8 in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 3 in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803, and 2 in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. PCC 7002). These conditions were applied to models run using two transcriptomic methods (E-Flux2 and SPOT) [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the non-transcriptomic method parsimonious FBA (pFBA) [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. E-Flux2 and SPOT were chosen as representative transcriptomic methods, and similarly pFBA was chosen as the representative non-transcriptomic method, because prior publications suggest they are among the best in their respective method classes [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study, the generality of E-Flux2 and SPOT have been validated against pFBA using this new dataset of diverse carbon sources and conditional constraints.</p><p>In the absence of carbon source and growth condition data, transcriptomic coupled constraint-based modeling is useful in bridging this information gap. If it is even feasible in the experimental condition of interest, the extraction of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled isotopes is costly and laborious. Additionally, many published <sup>13</sup>C-MFA studies are unable to be reproduced due to missing information, with &#x0201c;only 30% of the studies examined were found to be acceptable&#x0201d; in a review by Crown et al. [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The <sup>13</sup>C-labeled data also conveys minimal growth condition information as it cannot be directly applied to non-carbon metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, gene expression data is relatively simple to gather and is obtained from cell culturing experiments regularly. With transcriptomic FBA methods, researchers can utilize their gathered expression data to estimate intracellular metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Gene expression, flux datasets, and metabolic models</title><p>All gene expression measurements obtained were not normalized any further past the instrument processed signal.

SPOT provides a reasonable, but lower average prediction for both DC cases. E-Flux2 predicts flux similarly to pFBA except E-Flux2 was not provided any uptake rate information. The effect of gene expression derived reaction bounds predicts central carbon flux well, even without providing respective carbon uptake rates. This suggests that gene expression can serve as a substitute for measured carbon source uptake information, if the carbon source is known.</p><p>If carbon source is speculatively known, uptake rate is unknown, and presented with a relatively small set of 8 possible carbon sources (AC), pFBA predictive power drops significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Without transcriptomic data, pFBA sets fixed proportion uptake rates of the available metabolites in the model across multiple cases. This affects the subsequent central carbon flux prediction as a single flux pattern is being predicted across all conditions. In contrast, the transcriptome coupled methods do not have the same uptake of carbon source per condition, as the gene expression dictates the proportions of carbon source flux for cellular uptake. This suggests that with unknown uptake rates and speculatively known carbon sources, gene expression can still serve as a substitute for measured uptake rate data.</p><p>Under both unknown carbon source and unknown uptake rates (Full AC), where the models are allowed uptake of all possible carbon sources present in the model, the pFBA average prediction score drops further while E-Flux2 and SPOT remains similar to their AC correlations (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g002">2C</xref>). The E-Flux2 and SPOT average correlation even increases slightly from the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> AC to Full AC cases. A possible explanation is that in the overabundance of carbon sources, the gene expression can mediate the allocation of flux feeding into central carbon metabolism when presenting from multiple metabolic network entry points and thereby predict reaction directionality better (see S3&#x02013;S5 Figs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>). This is in contrast to when flux directionality is set based on a small set of carbon sources, such as the TCA cycle or glycolysis relevant metabolites.</p><p>Additionally, in the Full AC model, all ion uptake reactions were open, suggesting the transcriptome can also facilitate ion flux prediction, where <sup>13</sup>C data generally does not provide information. For both unknown carbon source and unknown uptake rate conditions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g002">2C</xref>), SPOT performs the best on average. This is likely due to SPOT maximizing correlation with flux prediction and the gene expression set, rather than setting expression-based reaction bounds (as in E-Flux2) which can set a large flux window that can affect predicted directionality in subsequent reactions (see S3&#x02013;S5 Figs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>). The generally higher prediction correlations for E-Flux2 and SPOT suggest that under both unknown carbon source and unknown uptake rates, gene expression data can substitute for carbon source and uptake rate information for central carbon flux prediction.</p><p>On average the transcriptomic methods perform better than pFBA under unknown carbon source and uptake, but in one exception of the double carbon source conditions, pFBA predicts central carbon flux with higher accuracy than either transcriptomic method across the DC, AC, and Full AC cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g002">Fig 2A, 2B and 2C</xref> glutamate + succinate). This is potentially due to pFBA predicting low flux correctly for a subset of the measured flux values for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, while E-Flux2 and SPOT allocated different fluxes for these reactions based on the presence of the associated transcripts (see reaction directions in S5 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>). Hence, when a measured reaction has low flux, but some transcript abundance, the transcriptomic methods may attribute more flux to these reactions.</p><p>Additionally, carbon source similarity affects flux predictions. On a carbon source basis, glutamate + succinate measured fluxes are similar to glycerol and pyruvate measured fluxes. The other double carbon source (malate + glucose) exhibits a measured flux distribution very close to the single carbon malate measured distribution (see S1A, S5 Figs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>). This suggests that some carbon sources produce similar flux distributions to others, both experimentally and <italic>in silico</italic>. This is supported by the clustering of pFBA flux patterns across all constraints and conditions (S1B, S5 Figs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>) which shows similarity between the predicted overall glutamate + succinate distribution to glycerol and pyruvate predicted distributions. This effect has also shown to shift flux predictions away from the measured distribution. In one case, the predicted distribution for malate + glucose more closely resembles the predicted glucose distribution, but in the measured flux patterns the malate + glucose measured flux distributions more closely resembles the malate flux distribution.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Correlations for known and unknown growth condition</title><p><bold>Central carbon flux correlations in PCC 6803.</bold> In <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

In the autotrophic growth condition, uptake rate of the inorganic carbon source does not significantly affect central carbon flux prediction (see S2 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>). But if an organism can increase biomass in multiple possible growth conditions (PCC 6803) then information pertaining to the presence and uptakes rates of inorganic carbon source versus glucose is much more useful.</p><p>With unknown growth condition information for PCC 6803, a reasonable approach for modeling the flux distribution is under mixotrophic conditions. That is, allow uptake of both inorganic and organic carbon as well as photon flux and use the associated gene expression to dictate how fluxes should be allocated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g003">Fig 3B</xref> shows that under such conditions, pFBA and E-Flux2 predict similarly poor central carbon flux. However, SPOT consistently produces positive correlations between the predicted and measured fluxes, across growth conditions. This suggests that with SPOT, gene expression can give some idea of what the condition an organism is growing under using gathered gene expression and the genome-scale metabolic model. A possible explanation for the lower predictive accuracy in both E-Flux2 and pFBA compared to SPOT, is that under glucose availability the typical glycolysis flux distribution is not always found it nature (S6 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>). In PCC 6803, we found fluxes in the pentose phosphate pathway (see S2 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238689.s006">S1 File</xref>), which is an alternative metabolic route to glycolysis, has significantly higher flux predicted through it for SPOT in comparison to the other methods. This is further supported by information suggesting that PCC 6803 is merely a facultative heterotroph and therefore only metabolizes exogenous organic carbon when given no other choice [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In PCC 7002, the growth condition is only partially known. PCC 7002 is modeled under photoautotrophic conditions, but key secondary metabolite uptake rates are unknown (NO<sub>3</sub> exchange). Here pFBA predicts central carbon flux poorly. By applying different uptake rates of non-carbon metabolites, it is possible to determine whether an organism is in one metabolic state versus another. For example, constraining the uptake of oxygen can produce a flux distribution for anaerobic metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similarly, in PCC 7002 the presence and depletion of nitrate to the system can lead to different intracellular carbon utilization.</p><p>PCC 7002 is known to be an obligate photoautotroph [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, non-transcriptomic methods should be able to perform well in predicting central carbon metabolism, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows that pFBA given known carbon source and uptake rate performs worse than the transcriptomic methods in both N-replete and N-deprived cases. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g004">Fig 4A</xref> SPOT predicts N-deprived central carbon flux better than the other methods. This likely due to the drawing of flux from the nitrogen sinks such as amino acids in order to accommodate for the lack of extracellular nitrate.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Extended analysis: Artificial conditional information deficit</title><p>As an extension of our findings, PCC 7002 was constrained under a second artificial growth condition set to mimic mixotrophic conditions. We attempted to predict flux using the second condition&#x02019;s set of incorrect conditional constraints and see how gene expression might help reduce prediction error. This allows for carbon sources other than CO<sub>2</sub> allowed for uptake as well as unconstrained NO<sub>3</sub> uptake for both the N-replete and N-deprived cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238689.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

With the nitrate growth condition unspecified in the model, NO<sub>3</sub> was allowed into the cell freely for both conditions. The correlations for E-Flux2 and pFBA were indeed poor, but SPOT produced strong correlations.

In such cases, gene expression data can nevertheless be gathered simply and cheaply, and methods to infer intracellular metabolic flux from transcriptomic data (such as E-Flux2 and SPOT) have great utility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0238689.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> model, data, and scripts used in this study.</title><p>The genome-scale metabolic model of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> iJO1366 [<xref rid="pone.0238689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

By systematically comparing the results of the methods with experimental C-13 MFA, they were able to determine the power of each method to correctly predict intracellular metabolic flux given the data constraints. Furthermore, they also analyzed data from non-model organisms of genus Synechococcus to ensure that their assessment were not model organism specific. Based on these thorough comparisons, the authors propose a decision tree that helps modellers choose the best method given the available data (Figure 5).</p><p>While the authors were thorough in their data collection, they were not as thorough in their analysis. The paper can be greatly strengthened by presenting variance in correlations between the model prediction and the experimental result. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the significance of difference between the different methods. The paper could also be strengthened by benchmarking it against other algorithms for integrating transcriptomics data (e.g. GIMME and iMAT). Overall, the exhaustive data collected/ analyzed and the decision tree produced by the paper would be a very useful guide to modellers working with incomplete dataset.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>In cases of low correlations between predicted and experimentally measured fluxes, it would be interesting to know if any particular pathway or subsystem contributes disproportionately to low correlation. These may point to failure points in the model and direct future improvements. This is briefly addressed on Line 172, but an expanded analysis could strengthen the paper.</p><p>Linde 177-178: &#x0201c;In speculative carbon sources, Fig 2B, all three methods perform similarly on average for AC. pFBA performs the best for the double carbon cases..&#x0201d;</p><p>These conclusions are difficult to make for these conditions. pFBA&#x02019;s performance on double carbon sources for AC is only slightly better (if at all). On &#x02018;mal + glcs&#x02019; pFBA is on par with E-Flux2.</p><p>Figure 3B: Though the correlations are negative, there is a strong correlation between the pFBA flux prediction and the measured flux prediction (r = ~0.64). It is not clear from the text why the correlation is so strong and what this implies about the pFBA prediction in this sample/condition.</p><p>The crux of the paper relies on comparing correlations between experimental and simulation data. However, almost all correlations are presented as the mean with little information about variance. This makes it difficult to understand how significant the differences in correlations between the different methods are (see #3 above). We suggest the authors calculate total variance in correlation.</p><p>The authors should consider adding analysis with GIMME and iMAT. We understand the authors have previously done similar comparisons between GIMME, iMAT and E-Flux2 + SPOT (Kim et al. 2016). However, with the addition of new organisms in this paper, it would be of interest to know how these different methods perform relative to each other. If E-Flux2 and SPOT still outperform GIMME and iMAT in these new conditions, it may also lead to greater usage of their methods in the future.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>If there are future rounds of reviews, please provide higher quality figures (specially figures 1 and 2). Currently they are difficult to read.</p><p>Line 165: Change &#x0201c;supplied with 8 the carbon sources&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;supplied with all 8 carbon sources.&#x0201d;</p><p>Figure 1B: The actual results should be described in the text beyond just description of what the analysis was (e.g. &#x0201c;Fluxes during glucose showed the highest correlation with&#x02026;.&#x0201d;).</p><p>Reviewer #2: This paper addresses a limitation of the subfield of metabolic network analysis concerned with predicting flux distributions under specific growth conditions (specified by key nutrient sources and/or maximum uptake rates). It collates 21 settings that have both Cabon-13 flux measurements (considered to be a gold standard here) as well as transcriptomic measurements that can be used to constrain a metabolic model. The models and the transcriptomic data are then used to predict fluxes, and these are then compared to the gold standard. The authors find that transcriptomic-based methods can be advantageous over standard methods when the transcriptomic data is obtained in a setting with incomplete information about the cell&#x02019;s growth conditions.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) I would have liked to see a more extensive discussion of the experimental error involved in measuring fluxes via Carbon-13; for instance, what is known about the repeatability of these measurements?</p><p>2) The correlation measure is very crude and hides a lot of nuances; for instance, not all fluxes are equally important to get right (the growth rate is typically the key quantity in model analysis, but also larger-scale pathway utilization may be of interest). Furthermore, it is very possible to have a perfect correlation, but be off by a factor of 10 in every single prediction - thus, not only should the correlation coefficient be reported, but also the equation of the line of best fit. An additional question could be about the similarities of the rankings between fluxes (e.g. Spearman correlation) because sometimes it is preferable to determine the relative importance of the reactions or pathways, rather than their absolute importance, to the cell&#x02019;s internal state.</p><p>In addition, the use of the correlation as the main metric is not ideal because the typical goal of a metabolic study is to obtain qualitative information about the internal state of the cell (often relative to a baseline), whereas the correlation tries to make a quantitative statement about it, which is often (though not always) an over-interpretation of the metabolic model&#x02019;s predictions.</p><p>3) It is unclear what the two growth conditions were used for PCC 7002 - only one of them is mentioned in the paper in the relevant section.</p><p>4) The figures (in particular, figures 1 and 2) are very grainy (low resolution) and do not use a consistent color scheme. They should be substantially improved. I recommend using ggplot2 in R for the plotting (alternatively, matplotlib in Python could work). You should also provide error bars on the plot, rather than having a mean and standard deviation specified in the legend.</p><p>5) The organization of the Results and Discussion section needs to be improved - the information is there, but hard to digest in the way it is currently organized. I would recommend having the sections represent an organism and the subsections represent the setting, or vice versa; right now it is a complicated mixture of both, which prevents an easy overview of the results.</p><p>6) I am not entirely convinced that the situation where the information about a cell&#x02019;s growth conditions is incomplete is a realistic one. I would like to see the discussion at least one clear setting where that is likely to happen (or, barring that, an acknowledgment by the authors that the utility of the proposed approach is limited to a somewhat hypothetical scenario).</p><p>7) Can you learn something by combining the outputs of all three methods? For instance, is the average of the three predictions (or the two predictions by the methods using transcriptomics data) better correlated with the gold standard than the individual one? This could be an interesting finding in and of itself.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Lines 43-44: Cells cultured on identical substrates produce highly conserved glucose metabolism pathways -&#x0003e; utilize highly similar pathways?</p><p>Line 66: To this end, we have [&#x02026;] -&#x0003e; specify to what end?</p><p>Line 83: Any log2 normalized data was exponentiated. -&#x0003e; I would say &#x0201c;any log-transformed data was transformed back to real scale by exponentiation&#x0201d; as normally, &#x0201c;exponentiated&#x0201d; suggests that the base of exponentiation was e, rather than 2.</p><p>Line 89: We used iJO1366 as the genome-scale metabolic model. -&#x0003e; I would have liked to see a discussion of the effect of the model choice on the results, though I recognize that this might be outside of the scope of the current article.</p><p>Line 101: remove the extra &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; before the formula for bicarbonate</p><p>Line 104: metabolites can exchange -&#x0003e; metabolites can be exchanged</p><p>Line 116: All methods used in this study are referenced with their original publications -&#x0003e; from their original publications? The sentence is very confusing in any case.</p><p>Line 118: When I follow the link I get the following error (please fix it): You don't have permission to access / on this server.</p><p>Line 139: see Methods 2.1 -&#x0003e; Section Methods 2.1</p><p>Line 310: incorrect hyphenation on both ends</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>PONE-D-19-22421R1</p><p>Assessment of transcriptomic constraint-based methods for central carbon flux inference</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Mr. Bhadra-Lobo,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>Both reviewers agree that your revised manuscript addresses the major concerns from the first review.&#x000a0; They identify minor corrections that are needed for the manuscript to be acceptable.&#x000a0;In particular,&#x000a0;Reviewer 2's concern regarding&#x000a0;M. tuberculosis must be addressed.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Mar 07 2020 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Christopher N.

If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the &#x0201c;Comments to the Author&#x0201d; section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the &#x0201c;Confidential to Editor&#x0201d; section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p><p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #3: All comments have been addressed</p><p>**********</p><p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p><p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p><p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p><p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p><p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#x02014;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#x02014;those must be specified.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p><p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p><p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p><p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #2: I thank the authors for addressing my concerns; however, their modifications have introduced some additional concerns, as detailed below. I do not believe these to be a major obstacle to publication, however, and am therefore recommending minor revisions.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) &#x0201c;enteric bacteria both pathogenic and commensal/mutualistic, in which the growth medium is complex,</p><p>and the culture is grown in vivo. An example of a pathogenic model is Mycobacterium tuberculosis.&#x0201d;</p><p>This incorrectly suggests that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an enteric pathogen, which it is not (it is primarily, though not exclusively, found in the lungs)</p><p>In tuberculosis, the bacterium live inside of scar tissue of the lung and their metabolism is uncertain.</p><p>Technically, the bacteria (plural!) live inside a granuloma, formed by macrophages, rather than &#x0201c;scar tissue&#x0201d;.</p><p>Also, please provide references; in particular, the work by Palsson&#x02019;s group on modeling Mycobacterium tuberculosis inside a macrophage seems relevant to cite (other models may have been published since as well).</p><p>&#x0201c;A hypothetical experiment would be to sample RNA from the gut during a period of one type of host diet, then sample RNA again after a period of time on another diet.&#x0201d;</p><p>Unfortunately, it is currently somewhat challenging to even determine the composition of a microbiome from RNA-Seq data at a particular timepoint with high accuracy; I think that expecting to detect changes in metabolism from this kind of data would be very ambitious (though some startups, such as Gusto, claim to be able to do that).</p><p>Grammar and minor comments:</p><p>simulated under based -&#x0003e; simulated based</p><p>Although this is dependent on the expression profiles and metabolic models to be complete enough for prediction of central carbon metabolism. - confusing!</p><p>decent correlations -&#x0003e; reasonable correlations</p><p>Double carbon sources are denoted as glutamate with succinate (Glut + Succ) and malate with glucose (Mal + Glcs). -&#x0003e; edit for grammar</p><p>If carbon source is speculatively known, and uptake rate is unknown, as presented with a relatively small set of 8 possible carbon sources (AC), pFBA predictive power drops significantly -&#x0003e; same</p><p>where more closely resembles -&#x0003e; same</p><p>S3 &#x02013; S5 Fig -&#x0003e; Fig. S3 &#x02013; S5 Fig</p><p>constrained under a second artificial growth condition was set to mimic -&#x0003e; edit for grammar</p><p>be used predict -&#x0003e; same</p><p>flux transcriptomic flux prediction. -&#x0003e; repeated word</p><p>S1, S2, and S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8 Figs -&#x0003e; same comment as above</p><p>Reviewer #3: The authors present here the use of non-transcriptomic-based and transcriptomic-based methods to predict metabolic fluxes, where nutrient sources and uptake rates are available or not available. The authors show that non-transcriptomic-based and transcriptomic-based methods perform similarly with information available on carbon sources and uptake rates. However, transcriptomic-based methods are better at predicting flux distributions than constraint-based method, across various organisms and conditions.</p><p>The authors have sufficiently addressed the reviewer comments and the overall organization and structure of the manuscript has improved. I do not have further concerns except a few minor comments.</p><p>There is wording on nitrogen (or N) deprived throughout the manuscript. It should be nitrogen-deprived or N-deprived.</p><p>The terms DC, AC and full AC appear before their full names were introduced.</p><p>Line 253 effects -&#x0003e; affects</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
