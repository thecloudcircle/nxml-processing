The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of under-recognition of AKI (beyond 3 days after AKI onset) on short-time prognosis. Of 785 patients with under-recognition of AKI and 616 patients with timely-recognition of AKI were propensity matched in a 1:1 ratio. The two groups, with a total of 482 matched patients (241:241), were comparable in baseline covariates. Under-recognition of AKI was not associated with 30-day all-cause mortality in the logistic regression model with covariate adjustment (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.01, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.62&#x02013;1.64, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.967). Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses also proved the association. There were also no significant differences in causes of 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, recovery of renal function at discharge, length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay or hospitalization costs between the two groups, although timely-recognition group had more chance of renal consult and a little more interventions for AKI. In conclusion, under-recognition of AKI may not be associated with poor short-term outcomes of adult hospitalized patients via these propensity-score-matched analyses.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The present study was supported by the Special Foundation for Clinical Science and Technology of Jiangsu Province (BL2014080), the Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation for Youths (BK20151022), Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province (WSN-056) and Blood Purification Quality Control Study of Chinese Hospital Association (CHABP2016-17).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important healthcare burden worldwide and affects about 13.3 million people annually, 85% of whom live in developing countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. AKI is thought to indirectly lead to 1.7 million deaths each year by greatly increasing the long-term risks of the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and even sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Although AKI is a relatively common disease, timely recognition is not necessarily associated with an optimistic prognosis because fewer than 50% of cases are diagnosed in the early stage of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A multi-center survey in China showed that only about 21.2% of AKI cases are timely diagnosed within 3 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The reasons for delayed diagnosis of AKI include not fully understanding the importance of the non-specific symptoms of the disease and the lack of early and proactive monitoring of renal function of high-risk patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Delayed diagnosis of AKI is known to increase the risk of adverse outcomes. For example, Wilson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> found that delayed diagnosis of AKI was associated with an increase in 30-day mortality by logistic regression analysis with stepwise correction. However, in that study, the correction factors included the largest Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score over the entire course of the disease, which itself could be affected by an actual delay in diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, the conclusions drawn from a logistic regression model may be somewhat misleading. Although a randomized controlled trial would be the best study design to detect the effects of delayed diagnosis, or under-recognition of AKI on short-term outcomes, such a study is not possible because of obvious violations of ethical standards. Therefore, at present, there actually exists no strong evidence to support the notion that the delayed or missed recognition of AKI would increase the risk of short-term adverse outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Here, a propensity score (PS) matched study was performed to investigate this issue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par5">Patients who were hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from October 2013 to September 2014 were screened<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and those who met the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI diagnostic criteria were included in the study.

In addition, PS matching in specific population with distribution in internal medicine/surgery/ICU department, or with varying types of AKI and primary reasons for hospital admission also proved this result (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Subgroup analyses of whether under-recognition of AKI increased risk of 30-day all-cause mortality.

Using a propensity score matching method, under-recognition of AKI was not associated with a poorer short-term outcome, which was confirmed by the sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses.</p><p id="Par22">AKI is an important healthcare burden worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, but under-recognition of AKI is very common, which may delay the prompt adoption of protective interventions, including volume repletion, blood pressure optimization, hematocrit correction, maintenance of adequate oxygen saturation, and avoidance or discontinuation of nephrotoxic drugs. Therefore, under-recognition of AKI was assumed to increase mortality or limit the recovery of renal function in AKI patients. But, the evidence supporting this viewpoint remains insufficient. In 2008, Wilson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> found that missed recognition of AKI could increase 30-day mortality by logistic regression stepwise correction, in which the correction factor was the largest SOFA score over the course of the disease. The SOFA score itself could be affected by misdiagnosis of AKI. Thus, this research could not fully confirm the above assumption. Besides, a randomized controlled trial to detect the effect of early recognition of AKI on short-term prognosis is not feasible in the real clinical world. Therefore, this propensity score matching study was designed to preliminarily discuss the issue.</p><p id="Par23">The results of this study showed that under-recognition of AKI did not significantly increase the risk of short-term adverse outcomes, including 30-day all-cause mortality, in-hospital mortality, and recovery of renal function at discharge. There are several possible explanations for these results. First, delayed or missed diagnosis of AKI actually may not be associated with poorer prognosis because of the lack of specific effective treatment for AKI, as prevention may be more important than treatment. A recent randomized controlled study reported that increasing the diagnostic rate of AKI through the use of an electronic warning system did not improve prognosis, which also supported our results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Second, increased recognition rates (such as from 5% to 40%) could lead to improved prognosis by greatly improving the effective treatment of AKI, but when the diagnostic rate increased to a certain level, such as from 40% to 60%, timely diagnosis may lead to little improvement in mortality because available treatment options to further improve prognosis were limited and difficult. Third, timely recognition did not mean very early recognition of AKI, which required physicians to recognize AKI within several hours. Perhaps the use of a more sensitive indicator for very early recognition of AKI could improve outcomes. Lastly, some results may be false-negatives because the median sample size of this study resulted in insufficient power (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.067) to prove these findings. Thus, a larger AKI population is needed to confirm this result.</p><p id="Par24">Early recognition of AKI without adequate intervention did not improve short-term outcomes. Our study showed that the chance of renal consult, the rate of stopping ACEIs or ARBs, the rate of renal ultrasound examination, and the use of diuretics increased in the timely-recognition group as compared to the under-recognition group, although diuretics were not recommended in all cases of AKI with the exception of fluid overload<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, our results showed that there were no differences between the matched groups in stopping nephrotoxic antibiotics within 3 days, use of NSAIDs, use of contrast agents, and transfusion within 3 days, which may attribute to the inadequate knowledge and training systems and insufficient multidisciplinary cooperation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Obviously, these factors were not sufficient to improve the short-term outcomes of AKI patients. There was also an increasing trend in the use of RRT in the TR group as compared to the UR group. A recent randomized study showed that an automated, electronic alert system for AKI did not improve outcomes and interventions except frequency of dialysis in surgical patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, which was similar to our results. This indicated that early recognition of AKI without adequate intervention could not improve short-term outcomes. Therefore, adequate intervention is as important as early recognition of AKI.</p><p id="Par25">There were several limitations to this study that should be addressed. First, the sample size of this study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;482) resulted in insufficient power (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.067). If the difference in the survival rate was 1.7% and &#x003b1; was set to 0.05 and &#x003b2; to 0.90, then 17542 cases would be needed in each group to detect a difference in survival rates. Thus, future studies with larger cohorts are required to verify this hypothesis. Second, the study population was distributed among different departments, so the primary disease, aggravating factors, and risk factors were heterogeneous. The matching method in this study may not be perfect despite the inclusion of 17 factors. Third, short-term, rather than long-term, prognosis was observed in this study because even stage 1 AKI could increase the long-term risk of CKD, and AKI patients with delayed or missed recognition are more likely to develop advanced CKD if there is no long-term follow-up of renal function. Hence, future research of the beneficial effect of improving AKI recognition on long-term outcomes is required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par26">The results of this propensity score matched study showed that under-recognition of AKI may not be associated with adverse short-term outcomes in hospitalized adult patients, which may attribute to the inadequate interventions for AKI. Due to the limitation of the sample size, further studies are required to confirm this result. Future studies are also warranted to investigate the effect of under-recognition of AKI on long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
