While cytotoxins cause mitochondrial dysfunction in different cell types, the mechanisms by which cytotoxins bind to mitochondria remain unknown. We analyzed the abilities of CTI and CTII, S-type and P-type cytotoxins from <italic>Naja naja oxiana</italic> respectively, to associate with isolated mitochondrial fractions or with model membranes that simulate the mitochondrial lipid environment by using a myriad of biophysical techniques. Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>31</sup>P-NMR) spectroscopy data suggest that both cytotoxins bind to isolated mitochondrial fractions and promote the formation of aberrant non-bilayer structures. We then hypothesized that CTI and CTII bind to cardiolipin (CL) to disrupt mitochondrial membranes. Collectively, <sup>31</sup>P-NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), proton NMR (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR), deuterium NMR (<sup>2</sup>H-NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and erythrosine phosphorescence assays suggest that CTI and CTII bind to CL to generate non-bilayer structures and promote the permeabilization, dehydration and fusion of large unilamellar phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes enriched with CL. On the other hand, CTII but not CTI caused biophysical alterations of large unilamellar PC liposomes enriched with phosphatidylserine (PS). Mechanistically, single molecule docking simulations identified putative CL, PS and PC binding sites in CTI and CTII. While the predicted binding sites for PS and PC share a high number of interactive amino acid residues in CTI and CTII, the CL biding sites in CTII and CTI are more divergent as it contains additional interactive amino acid residues. Overall, our data suggest that cytotoxins physically associate with mitochondrial membranes by binding to CL to disrupt mitochondrial structural integrity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The data collection, analyses and design of experiments were supported by National Institute of Health (NIH) grants GM103554 (to RKD), NIH P20GM103440 (to BZ), and by an internal International Activities Grant Award (University of Nevada, Reno to RKD).

Cytotoxins exhibit strong amphiphilicity on their molecular surface: apolar tips (loops I-III) that are flanked by small stretches of highly conserved positively charged Lys and Arg residues. In addition, cytotoxins are composed of two &#x003b2;-sheets that are stabilized by four conserved disulfide bonds [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cytotoxins are predominantly characterized as cell membrane-permeabilizing proteins that can associate with anionic phospholipids located on the surface of the plasma membranes prior to their intracellular uptake. In addition to their ability to interact with cell membranes, recent evidence suggest that these proteins target the lipid bilayers of intracellular organelles including mitochondria (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]).</p><p>Cytotoxins have been classified as either S-type cytotoxins (contain a serine in amino acid position 28 of loop II) or as P-type cytotoxins (contain a proline in amino acid position 30 of loop II). Interestingly, this single amino acid substitution is correlated with drastic differences in cytotoxin-mediated cytotoxicity in different mammalian cell types. In most instances, P-type cytotoxins are generally more potent than S-type cytotoxins for disrupting cell membranes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pathological effects of cytotoxins in mammalian cells include their ability to depolarize excitable membranes of cardiac myocytes and neurons, deregulate the activity of cell membrane-bound enzymes and receptors, induce hemolysis and cytotoxicity, inhibit platelet aggregation, and bring about cardiac arrest (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]).</p><p>Cytotoxins electrostatically interact with anionic lipids on the cell membrane to form stable oligomeric complexes that can act as pore-forming structures [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Studies in phosphatidylcholine (PC) model membranes enriched with variable amounts of anionic phospholipids suggest that cytotoxins can disrupt the structure and molecular organization of phospholipid bilayers by dehydrating lipid bilayers [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], inducing the rapid aggregation of phospholipids [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], promote the formation of non-bilayer structures [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], cause an intermembrane exchange of lipids [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and cause the fusion of lipid bilayers [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These molecular events are believed to underlie cytotoxin-mediated pathology including increased plasma membrane permeability and cell lysis.</p><p>Although cobra cytotoxins lack putative canonical mitochondrial and/or lysosomal targeting sequences, several cell biological studies suggest that certain cobra cytotoxins colocalize with mitochondria and lysosomes to cause mitochondrial swelling/fragmentation and depolarization and lysosomal permeabilization [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, treating cardiac myocytes with cytotoxins results in robust mitochondrial fragmentation and necrotic cell death while promoting mitochondrial permeability and induction of apoptosis of human leukemia K562 cells [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These observations suggest that unidentified mitochondrial biomolecules targeted by cytotoxins lead to either cytotoxin-mediated cell death through necrosis or bax-dependent apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Two particular cytotoxins known as CTI and CTII (S-type and P-type cytotoxins formerly known as Vc1 and Vc5 respectively [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) from <italic>Naja naja oxiana</italic> have been well characterized for their cytotoxic and cell membrane disrupting activities. While both cytotoxins show a high amino acid homology (80% homology), they exhibit major differences in cytotoxity towards different mammalian cell lines and in their abilities to disrupt liposomes containing different phospholipids [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These observations suggest that minor differences in their amino acid sequences or in their electrostatic environment between S- and P-type cytotoxins confer variable cytotoxicity.</p><p>Given that cytotoxins are highly basic amphipathic proteins [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we surmised that cytotoxins selectively target mitochondria by interacting with anionic phospholipids such as cardiolipin (CL), a phospholipid enriched in inner mitochondrial membranes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, we show for the first time that cobra venom cytotoxins CTI and CTII affect the structural organization of phospholipids in membranes of isolated mitochondria. To further understand the implications of cytotoxin-mediated structural alterations of mitochondrial membranes, we analyzed the abilities of CTI and CTII to interact with lipid films and large unilamellar liposomes enriched with cardiolipin (model membranes that simulate the outer mitochondrial membrane) by using a myriad of biophysical techniques including <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectroscopy, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy, <sup>2</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy, EPR of spin probes, luminescent probes, and differential scanning calorimetry. These biophysical studies were complemented with computer simulations of molecular docking analyses of several lipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin (PC, PS and CL) with cytotoxins. Overall, this study suggests that CTI and CTII physically bind with cardiolipin (CL) in model membranes to alter the structural organization of lipid bilayers. Interestingly, CTII has a greater propensity for altering membranes enriched with phosphatidylserine (PS) and CL compared to CTI suggesting that minor differences in the amino acid sequence of the biological active loops dictate specificity for differentially binding to PS or CL. Docking simulations identified CL, PS and phosphatidylcholine (PC) binding sites in CTI and CTII. The putative docking sites for CL in CTI and CTII contain a cluster of N-terminal basic residues that are distinct from residues interacting with PS or PC. In summary, our data suggest that both cobra venom cytotoxins can associate with mitochondrial membranes to form non-bilayer structures prior to disrupting mitochondrial integrity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Isolation of Mitochondria</title><p>Cauliflower mitochondria were isolated from 2.5 kg of the top layers (&#x0201c;rosettes&#x0201d;) as previously published [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Bovine heart mitochondria were isolated as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The final crude mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 4.5 ml of washing medium (0.3 M mannitol, 10 mM MOPS, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA at pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 60 mg/ml and was used for the three independent <sup>31</sup>P-NMR tests (1.5 ml of re-suspended mitochondria was placed in an NMR tube for one test). Following each mitochondrial isolation, the respiratory control index (RCI) values for all mitochondrial samples were measured as the ratio of the O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate following the addition of ADP divided by the O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate after all ADP has been converted to ATP [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Freshly isolated intact cauliflower and bovine heart mitochondria yielded similar RCI values (between 3 and 4) when succinate was employed as a substrate. The RCI values in all control samples were measured at 10&#x000b0;C every 30 min for 210 min, a time frame that is similar to the duration of <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectroscopy experiments. Cauliflower mitochondria showed no change in RCI values for 210 min while RCI values in bovine heart mitochondria declined after 90 min of incubation suggesting that bovine heart mitochondria undergoes structural/functional degradation by this time point. Hence, due to its more stable oxygen consumption activity, we decided to use cauliflower mitochondria for all ensuing <sup>31</sup>P-NMR studies. Moreover, it is worth noting that we observed that the fluidity of cauliflower mitochondrial membranes at 10&#x000b0;C is equal to the fluidity of large unilamellar liposome membranes at 18&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

The PDB coordinates of CL were extracted from the bovine heart oxidoreductase crystal structure bound to CL (PDB ID# 1V54). The PDB coordinates of phosphatidylcholine (PC) were extracted from the structure of PITP complexed to DOPC (PDB ID# 1T27) while the PDB coordinates of PS were extracted from the crystal structure of Tim-4 bound to PS (PDB ID# 3BIB). The lipids were further edited to remove the alkyl chains using Avogadro [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the overall charges were checked and energy minimized using AutoDock. The phospholipid &#x0201c;ligands&#x0201d;, which consisted only of the phospholipid head groups, contained rotatable bonds whereas the cytotoxins were kept as rigid molecules for each run. The overall molecular surface of CTI and CTII were considered for these docking studies (blind docking). A grid box was set up with following dimensions: center of x = 0.271; center of y = 0.855; center of z = 0.382; length of x = 100&#x000c5;; length of y = 104&#x000c5;; length of z = 80&#x000c5; (104 &#x000c5; for CTII). It is important to note that the grid box was large enough to do a &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; dock by covering the entire surface of the cytotoxin and a phospholipid &#x0201c;ligand&#x0201d; for each molecular docking simulation.

Four cytotoxins possess an overall charge of +10. One of these four cytotoxins is an S-type (PDB ID #1CDT) cytotoxin while the remaining three cytotoxins are classified as P-type cytotoxins including CTII from <italic>Naja naja oxiana</italic> (PDB ID#1CB9), CTX IIb from <italic>Naja mossambica mossambica</italic> (PDB ID # 2CCX), and cytotoxin V from <italic>Naja naja atra</italic> (PDB ID# 1CVO). P-type cytotoxins show high degree of hydrophobicity for loop I compared to S-type cytotoxins (LIPPF or LVPLF for 2CCX and 1CB9 vs. LIPIA or LVPIA for 1CDT and 1ZAD). P-type cytotoxins also show stronger hydrophobicity for loops II (VAAP-VPV, AAP-VPV for 1CB9 and 2CCX) compared to S-type cytotoxins (ASK-VPV and MSD-IPV for 1CDT and 1ZAD) and in loop III as well (LLV and LLI for P-type cytotoxins vs. ALV for most S-type cytotoxins). Hence, the higher hydrophobicity and overall positive charge of CTII is consistent with its enhanced cytotoxic activities compared to CTI [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>While recent cell biological studies have shown that cytotoxins can colocalize with mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and cause mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], there is little evidence supporting a direct biophysical interaction of cytotoxins with mitochondrial membranes. In addition, the molecular mechanisms by which cytotoxins disrupt mitochondria are not known. CTI and CTII, are highly cationic three-fingered fold proteins. These proteins have a conserved three fingered domain that contains a cluster of basic amino acids located within the N-terminal region (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Hence, given their highly basic molecular surface, we surmised that CTI and CTII can directly associate with isolated mitochondrial fractions by binding to anionic phospholipids.

For the purpose of this study, we employed cauliflower mitochondria instead of bovine heart mitochondria given their much longer structural stability following their isolation as assessed by oxygen consumption assays (described in Materials/Methods section). It is worth noting that plant and animal mitochondria are structurally similar [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and have a similar content of mitochondrial phospholipids including CL, PS and PC [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In the absence of cytotoxins, proton-decoupled <sup>31</sup>P-NMR from isolated mitochondria yielded a spectrum containing an asymmetrical shaped peak located at the high-field side (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This line-shape corresponds to an anisotropic orientation of phospho-ether bonds of phospholipids found in a lamellar phase, a property of biological lipid bilayers [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We then applied a DANTE train of saturation pulses at the high-field peak of the lamellar spectrum to determine whether signal(s) from non-lamellar phase(s) are hidden by the lamellar phase signal. Indeed, applying a DANTE saturation pulse led to the complete disappearance of the lamellar signals, indicating that all mitochondrial phospholipids in untreated mitochondrial samples are packed in a lipid bilayer (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). On the other hand, incubating mitochondrial fractions with 9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> M of CTI or CTII generated two additional <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signals: signal A, a narrow peak located at 0 ppm and a broader signal B located to the right of signal A. Signal A is associated with a non-bilayer structure that exhibits rapid isotropic molecular mobility (1 x 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> s) [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

We then investigated the molecular organization of the phospholipids associated with these two additional signals induced by treating mitochondria with CTI and CTII. Applying a DANTE train of saturation pulses led to a complete elimination of signal A and the signal associated with the lamellar phase of the<sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectra suggesting that phospholipids associated with the signal A efficiently exchange with phospholipids of a lamellar phase. On the other hand, signal B remained in the <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectra after applying the DANTE train of saturation (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>, hatched lines) indicating that these non-bilayer packed phospholipids do not exchange with a lamellar phase likely as a result of direct interaction with either CTII or CTI. We then quantitatively estimated the total amount of immobilized phospholipids induced by both cytotoxins by calculating the area under the curve below the <sup>31</sup>P<sup>-</sup>NMR signal B after a DANTE train of saturation (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>, hatched lines) was applied. We calculated that at a lipid:toxin molar ratio 70:1, approximately 13.8 moles of phospholipids were immobilized by CTII while 10 moles of phospholipids were immobilized by CTI or 19.7% and 14.3% of the total mitochondrial phospholipids respectively. These results suggest that CTII can restrict the mobility of mitochondrial phospholipids to a greater extent than CTI.

These results suggest that distinct molecular regions or lipid binding sites in the three-fingered domain of CTI and CTII are involved in binding CL and PS.</p><p>To obtain a better sense of affinity of CTI and CTII for phospholipids, we estimated the amount of phospholipids immobilized by cytotoxins in model membranes by calculating the area under the signal B of the <sup>31</sup>P<sup>-</sup>NMR spectra remaining after applying a DANTE train of saturation at the high-field lamellar signal (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F&#x02013;2H</xref>). Treating PC+ CL liposomes with CTII at toxin to lipid molar ratios of 0.01 and 0.02 led to an increase in the intensity and size of the <sup>31</sup>P<sup>-</sup>NMR signals remaining after a DANTE saturation, whereas only a mild increase was observed in PC + PS liposomes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F&#x02013;2H</xref>). On the other hand, CTI produced a modest increase in immobilized phospholipids in PC + CL liposomes at the same toxin to lipid ratios (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). These results suggest that CTII immobilizes a greater amount of phospholipids found in a non-bilayer phase compared to CTI. By calculating the integral of the intensity of these peaks, we estimated that approximately 16.5% and 24.4% of the total phospholipids were immobilized by CTII in PC+CL liposomes whereas 8.58% and 10.14% of the total phospholipids were immobilized by CTI at toxin to lipid molar ratios of 0.01 and 0.02 respectively. At the same time, an increase in the toxin to lipid molar ratio from 0.01 to 0.02 was associated with a decrease in the number of moles of immobilized phospholipids per mole of toxin (16.1 to 12.2 per mole of CTII and from 13.2 to 7.8 per mole of CTI). Similarly to PC+CL liposomes, in PC+PS liposomes an increase in CTII to lipid ratio from 0.01 to 0.02 was associated with a decrease of the number of immobilized lipids per mole of CTII from 9.4 to 5.1 (equal to 9.4% and 10.4% of total immobilized phospholipids for PC +PS liposomes). Therefore, these results suggest that CTII can immobilize a larger amount of phospholipids in large unilamellar liposomes that contain anionic phospholipids compared to CTI. The decrease in the number of immobilized lipids per mole of cytotoxin may be a direct consequence of a saturation of the lipid bilayer by CTI and CTII at high concentrations which leads to further mild increase in binding of the cytotoxin to phospholipid membranes or possible dimerization at high toxin to lipid molar ratios.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Cytotoxins promote a disorientation of lipid bilayers containing cardiolipin</title><p>To further characterize the biophysical effects of CTI and CTII on lipid bilayers, we employed EPR spectroscopy to analyze differences in the rotational movement and the orientation of phospholipids in cytotoxin-treated model membranes containing 5-doxylstearic acid (5-DSA). Unlike other biophysical techniques, EPR can quantify the spin and orientation of phospholipids at a higher temporal resolution (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> s) [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Lipid bilayers are characterized by a strong anisotropic orientation of phospholipids. Indeed, the EPR spectra of 5-DSA in lipid films composed of PC+10 mol% CL showed strong spectral anisotropy as demonstrated by the presence of narrow EPR resonance lines obtained when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the bilayer normal and by the presence of wider resonance lines when the magnetic field is parallel to the lipid bilayer (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> upper spectra). PC+10 mol% CL lipid films treated with a low concentration of CTI and CTII produced a modest broadening and overlap of EPR spectra obtained when the magnetic field was applied perpendicular and parallel to the bilayer normal (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>; middle spectra).

The new high-field resonance in PC+CL liposomes treated by either CTII or CTI is likely a result of a closer distance between [Fe(CN<sub>6</sub>)]<sup>-3</sup> ions and choline groups of PC which is associated with a non-bilayer structure that consists of PC molecules and CL molecules as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

To address this possibility, we employed <sup>2</sup>H-NMR to determine whether CTII and CTI can induce the dehydration of PC+CL and PC+PS large unilamellar liposome surfaces given that membrane dehydration is an imperative phenomenon that precedes membrane fusion. The anisotropy of the mobility of <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O bound to membrane phospholipids results in a quadrupole splitting of a characteristic <sup>2</sup>H-NMR resonance line. The extent of the splitting of this specific <sup>2</sup>H-NMR resonance line is associated with increased anisotropy [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. <sup>2</sup>H-NMR spectrum of hydrated membranes composed of PC+10 mol% CL or PC+10 mol% PS (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O: lipid molar ratio = 10: 1) yields a signal with an axially symmetrical tensor of the electrical field gradient (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The quadrupole splitting values were observed at 1050 Hz and 1127 Hz for liposomes enriched with CL and PS respectively. However, these quadrupole splitting values were markedly smaller compared to immobilized water molecules in ice (~165kHz [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Treating PC+10 mol% CL hydrated membranes with CTI (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O: CTI: lipid = 100: 1: 10) yielded <sup>2</sup>H-NMR spectra containing a superimposed duplet and singlet signals (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). A singlet signal is associated with <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O molecules bound to cytotoxin suggesting that CTI immobilized <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. Moreover, the quadrupole splitting value of a duplet signal decreased from 1050 Hz to 700 Hz. A decrease in the quadrupole splitting value is associated with a large area of dehydrated membranes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Hence, this significant decrease in quadrupole splitting value is a result of CTI-mediated dehydration of phospholipids that directly interact with the cytotoxin. Moreover, the value of quadrupole splitting in PC + 10 mol% CL membranes treated with CTII (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O: CTII: lipid = 100: 1: 10) was observed at 540 Hz (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) suggesting that CTII has a greater effect on the fusion of PC+CL hydrated membranes compared to CTI. Similarly, CTI and CTII were able to dehydrate PC+PS membranes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). However, the extent of dehydration by CTII was significantly greater than CTI (quadrupole splitting values of 890 Hz and 590 Hz for CTI and CTII respectively).</p><p>To further confirm the abilities of CTI and CTII to fuse lipid membranes, we analyzed the exchange of lipids between two populations of liposomes as a result of cytotoxin-induced intermembrane lipid exchange, a molecular event that is associated with membrane fusion [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We used differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSM) to measure the heat flow produced by the intermembrane exchange of large unilamellar liposomes composed of different lipids. Large unilamellar liposomes made of a single type of saturated phospholipids undergo a solid to liquid phase transition within a narrow temperature range. The temperature value of a solid to liquid phase transition is correlated with the hydrocarbon chain length and the structure of the polar head of the phospholipids [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, we used two types of large unilamellar liposomes, one made of dimiristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and another of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). These two types of liposomes differ in values of their transition temperatures by approximately 18&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 1&#x02013;2 and 13&#x02013;14). The addition of 5 mol% CL into liposomes composed of either DMPC or DPPC dramatically reduces the melting cooperativity as shown by a broadening of the calorimetric curves while shifting the calorimetric peaks toward lower temperatures (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 3 and 4 respectively). The broadening of a calorimetric curve is particularly noticeable with DMPC, which possesses shorter alkyl chains compared to DPPC, thus making it more susceptible to lipid packing disordering (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 3). The addition of CTII (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 5 and 6) and CTI (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 7 and 8) into DPPC+CL or DMPC+CL liposomes increased the lipid melting cooperativity in a similar trend as untreated DMPC and DPPC liposomes lacking CL (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 1 and 2). This phenomenon is a result of cytotoxin-mediated phase segregation of CLs that frees areas of pure DMPC and DPPC. A calorimetric curve from a mixture of two populations of untreated liposomes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 9) demonstrated no evidence of inter-liposomal exchange since their individual maximal transition temperatures coincided with the maximal transition temperatures of curves 3 and 4 (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). As a positive control for this assay, the sonication of two liposome populations resulted in a single phase transition peak (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 10). These results suggest that two populations of liposomes are completely mixed in a single set of liposomes. A similar result was obtained when CTII (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 11) or CTI (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 12) were added to a mixture of two liposomal populations. However, for these treatments, we observed more pronounced phase transition peaks for liposomal samples treated with CTII (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 11) or CTI (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 12) compared to sonication-mediated fusion of liposomes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 10), which was likely a result of cytotoxin-induced segregation of CL. Moreover, single transition peaks (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 11 and 12) indicate that most of DMPC and DPPC are mixed, which most likely is a result of cytotoxin-induced fusion of liposomes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similarly, both cytotoxins were found to slightly lower the transition phase temperatures of the calorimetric curves of DPPC or DMPC liposomes containing one of two types of PS molecules, dimiristoylphosphatidylserine (DMPS) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS) (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 17&#x02013;20) compared to untreated liposomes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curves 15 and 16). The sonication of these two mixtures of liposomes results in the formation of a single phase transition peak (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 22). The addition of only CTII, but not CTI, significantly broadens the calorimetric curves of a mixture of DPPC and DMPC liposomes containing DPPS and DMPS respectively (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, 23 and 24 respectively) compared to an untreated mixture of liposomes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, curve 21). Overall, these results suggest that CTI and CTII can equally cause the inter-membrane exchange of lipids and fusion of model membranes containing CL, while only CTII can efficiently cause the inter-membrane exchange of lipids of PS containing liposomes as induced by cytotoxins. Collectively, so far our data suggest that minor structural elements found in P-type cytotoxins (CTII), but not in S-type cytotoxins (CTI), confer enhanced ability to remodel and disrupt membranes by permeabilizing bilayers (PS or CL), forming non-bilayer structures and dehydrating the surface of membranes, events associated with fusion of membranes.</p><fig id="pone.0129248.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0129248.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Fusogenic effects of CTI and CTII on lipid bilayers.</title><p>Calorimetric curves of large unilamellar liposomes containing: DMPC alone (curves 1 and 13); DPPC alone (curves 2 and 14); DMPC+ 5 mol% CL (curve 3); DPPC+ 5 mol% CL (curve 4); DMPC + 5mol% CL + CTII (curve 5); DPPC + 5 mol% CL + CTII (curve 6); DMPC + 5 mol% CL + CTI (curve 7); DPPC +5mol% CL + CTI (curve 8); a mixture of DMPC + 5 mol% CL and DPPC + 5 mol% CL (curve 9); mixture 9 after sonication (curve 10); mixture 9 + CTII (curve 11); mixture 9 + CTI (curve 12); DMPC + 10 mol% DMPS (curve 15); DPPC + 10 mol% DPPS (curve 16); DMPC + 1 0mol% DMPS + CTII (curve 17); DPPC + 10 mol% DPPS + CTII (curve 18); DMPC + 10 mol% DMPS + CTI (curve 19); DPPC + 10 mol% DPPS + CTI (curve 20); a mixture of DMPC + 10 mol% DMPS and DPPC + 10 mol% DPPS (curve 21); mixture 21 after sonication (curve 22); mixture 21 + CTII (curve 23); mixture 21 + CTI (curve 24).

This concentration of CL or PS exceeds the amount of anionic phospholipids found in the OMM under physiological conditions. Hence, in order to elucidate the minimal concentrations of CL and PS needed to interact with CTI and CTII in PC liposomes, the quenching of erythrosine phosphorescence induced by ferrocene was analyzed for various liposomal membrane preparations at a cytotoxin to lipid molar ratio of 0.01. The phosphorescence life-time value depends on the rate of molecular movement of a probe in the lipid phase and is very sensitive to the interaction of cytotoxins with the surface of liposomes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

To address this hypothesis, we performed molecular docking simulations to identify molecular mechanisms by which CTI and CTII bind to CL, PC or PS. Hence, to identify putative binding sites of phospholipids on the molecular surfaces of CTI and CTII, we separately docked the PC, PS and CL to the solution NMR structures of CTI and CTII. Given that alkyl chains of phospholipids are confined inside the lipid bilayer and do not likely interact with the cytotoxin at the initial stage of cytotoxin binding to membrane surface, we disregarded the alkyl chains of phospholipids for the docking studies by truncating the alkyl chains. Hence, the alkyl chains were truncated, energy minimized in Autodock and verified for the correct overall charge for PC, PS and CL.

However, unlike small sonicated liposomes treated with cytotoxins, we show for the first time that CTI and CTII can promote the formation of non-bilayer structures containing immobilized phospholipids in isolated mitochondria and in large unilamellar liposomes and lipid films containing CL or PS (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), an experimental system that is considered a superior membrane model mirroring the biophysical properties of biologically-relevant lipid bilayers [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Following membrane fusion of neighboring cells, such an inverted micelle settles in a single membrane (<bold>D</bold>). Due to the high surface curvature, an inverted micelle eventually undergoes a lamellar phase with the eventual release of cytotoxin into the cytosol (left side of model). In addition, due to the insertion of cytotoxins in a membrane to the depth of one monolayer [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], cytotoxins induce an asymmetric enlargement of the membrane monolayer surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] which may trigger formation of toroidal like pores (<bold>E</bold> (54)) which may account for <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signal A (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) and the increased membrane permeability (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Once in the cytosol, cytotoxin translocates to the mitochondrion (right side of model). Upon binding to select few CL molecules on the OMM surface, cytotoxins, sequestered by inverted micelles may translocate into the inter-membrane space where cytotoxins may further promote the fusion between the inner leaflet of an OMM and the outer leaflet of an IMM.

These non-bilayer phospholipids with rapid isotropic mobility, which exchange with a lamellar phase, are likely derived from transient inverted micelles formed at dehydrated contacts of lipid bilayers and/or from cytotoxin-induced toroidal pores [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Other types of non-bilayer lipids, such as normal micelles (which exist in solution) and bicontinuous cubic phase do not freely exchange with a lamellar phase, while lipids of inverted micelles at dehydrated contacts have rapid isotropic mobility and freely exchange with a lamellar phase [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] as well as lipids at the curved toroidal pore surface [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Phospholipids with restricted isotropic mobility that do not exchange with a lamellar phase most likely directly interact with the cytotoxin's ionic and polar groups, which facilitates the insertion of the cytotoxin into membrane and triggers formation of a non-bilayer phase responsible for <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signal B [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, we also observed the formation of these two types of non-bilayer structures in cytotoxin-treated large unilamellar PC liposomes containing 10 mol% of either CL, the most abundant anionic phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or PS, a major anionic phospholipid in eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that is also found in mitochondrial membranes, albeit in smaller quantities [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. CTII was able to induce formation of these two types of non-bilayer structures in both PC+CL and PC+PS large unilamellar liposomes, while CTI was able to do the same only in PC+CL large unilamellar liposomes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D&#x02013;2H</xref>).</p><p>In addition, our <sup>1</sup>H-NMR permeabilization data (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) suggest that CTI and CTII may form toroidal pores [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Toroidal pores can form as a result of cytotoxin-induced asymmetric enlargement of the monolayer surfaces of liposomes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. At the same time, PC+CL liposomes treated with either CTI or CTII produced a new high-field <sup>1</sup>H-NMR signal (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) which is likely caused from a close distance between Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>

This close interaction of Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> ions with the N<sup>+</sup>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> groups of PC may occur in the hydrophilic core of non-bilayer structures which likely account for <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signal B. This second <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signal is produced when both CL and PC molecules are immobilized via the direct interaction with cytotoxins. In these non-bilayer structures, PC molecules may bind to cytotoxins via various types of polar interactions (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129248.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables). It should be noted that we did not observed a rise of a new high-field <sup>1</sup>H-NMR signal (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>) in PC+PS liposomes treated with either CTI or CTII whereas <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectra of the same liposomes treated with CTII produced a non-bilayer signal B (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). This result suggest that non-bilayer phospholipids in PC+PS liposomes that directly interact with CTII include only PS molecules, which unlike PC molecules, do not have a N<sup>+</sup>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> group. This observation agrees with our docking data (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). These data suggest that PS molecules compete with PC molecules for similar binding sites on the molecular surface of CTII and have a higher binding affinity than PC.</p><p>In addition, the <sup>31</sup>P NMR signals raise the possibility that CTI and CTII may be dimerizing in liposomal membranes at high concentrations. From integral intensities of <sup>31</sup>P NMR signals B, which remained after applying the DANTE saturation pulses (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F&#x02013;2H</xref>), we estimated the amounts of cytotoxin-immobilized phospholipids. We observed that amounts of immobilized phospholipids were not increasing proportionally with increasing toxin concentrations while the moles of immobilized lipids decreased per mole of toxin. This phenomenon could be attributed to the possibility that the phospholipid membranes were saturated at the higher concentrations of cytotoxins, leading to a slow increase in the total amount of immobilized phospholipids. On the other hand, it is conceivable that dimerization of toxin on liposomal surface was taking place, which resulted in less phospholipids binding to dimers per mole of toxin as previously suggested by previous study of cobra venom cardiotoxin A3 oligomerization in model membranes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although, previous X-ray small angle scattering studies did not detect the formation of CTII dimers in phospholipid membrane films of PC+10 mol% phosphatidic acid (PA) [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], it is possible that in liposome systems containing CL and PS, which have multiple charge centers, dimerization of CTII and CTI may take place at higher toxin concentrations. Additional studies are required to elucidate whether dimerization takes place in our system.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Proposed mechanisms by which CTI and CTII translocate from cell membrane to mitochondria</title><p>Cytotoxins first interact with the cell membrane prior to their cytosolic translocation and interaction with mitochondria. Our data in model membranes suggest that cytotoxin-mediated destabilization of membrane bilayers and membrane surface dehydration (Figs <xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129248.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129248.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) may lead to the following structural alterations in lipid membranes: 1) the formation of inverted micelles at zones of dehydrated intermembrane contacts (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, model in inset A and B) according to mechanisms we have previously described [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and/or 2) the formation of toroidal pore structures (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, model in inset E) resulting from the cytotoxin-induced asymmetric enlargement of monolayer surfaces of the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Phospholipids that directly interact with cytotoxins include phase segregated anionic phospholipids such as PS found in the plasma cell membrane. Cytotoxin-dehydrated PS molecules acquire a reverse wedge molecular shape which covers less area at the surface of their polar heads compared to their alkyl chains. This molecular event likely mediates the insertion of the hydrophobic core of a cytotoxin into the lipid bilayer followed by the enclosure of the cytotoxin in the center of an inverted micelle that is formed at dehydrated contact sites of neighboring cell membranes (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, model in inset C). Therefore, the formation of non-bilayer "lipidic particles" at the contact zones of neighboring membranes, which were previously described as inverted micellar inter-bilayer structures, likely promotes the fusion of cell membranes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The mobility of phospholipids in inverted micelles is restricted through the direct interaction with the cytotoxin that gives rise to <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signal B (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Following membrane fusion of neighboring membranes, inverted micelles settle in a single membrane (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, model in inset D). Due to the high surface curvature, inverted micelles eventually transform into a lamellar phase with the eventual release of cytotoxin into the cytosol. It should be noted that only CTII, but not CTI, was able to modify the bilayer packing of PS-containing membranes. This is likely due to the low hydrophobicity of loop II and smaller overall basic charge (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) which prevents CTI from efficiently penetrating into a PC+PS membrane compared to CTII. On the other hand, CTII may enable angled wedge dehydrated PS molecules, a molecular event necessary for the formation of non-bilayer structures. This concept agrees with the differences in decreased membrane disrupting activities of CTI towards membranes containing PS, which is probably due to the presence of Ser28 <italic>in lieu</italic> of Pro30 that is characteristic of S-type cytotoxins. Hence, the enhanced hydrophobicity and less flexible loop II is associated with increased cell membrane lytic activities of P-type cytotoxins as previously supported by experimental and computational biology data [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Once in the cytosol, cytotoxins are free to target mitochondria by interacting with CL molecules at the OMM. Our molecular docking data suggest that cytotoxins may initially bind to CL through CL binding sites proposed (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables), which dehydrates CL head groups and results in a reverse wedge due to the four alkyl chains of CL. Although we recognize that our docking data do not account for fact that phospholipid head groups are imbedded inside the lipid bilayer and may be sterically impeded from interacting with cytotoxins, it is conceivable that the initial electrostatic interaction of CTI or CTII with CL in the lipid bilayer may cause the lipid head groups from being partially &#x0201c;dislodged&#x0201d; from the membrane to enhance the probability of binding to cytotoxins. The three-fingered loops can enhance the interaction of CTI and CTII with CL by penetrating the lipid bilayer in an analogous manner as loop II with PS-containing membranes. In any case, dehydration of polar heads of CL greatly destabilizes the bilayer and facilitates the entry of cytotoxins' into the lipid membrane where the phosphate and glycerol groups of PC molecules are free to engage with cationic and polar residues of cytotoxins (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129248.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables). Upon gaining entry into the OMM, cytotoxins' non-interacting charged/polar residues outside lipid binding sites (<xref rid="pone.0129248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), which are predominantly located at the C-terminal region, may interact with polar heads from phospholipids of neighboring OMM to produce an extended dehydrated intermembrane contact region which may promote membrane fusion. This molecular event spontaneously generates an inverted micelle which forms a lipid &#x0201c;bridge&#x0201d; between neighboring membranes [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] that harbors a cytotoxin in its core (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, model in inset C). PC molecules are also drawn into this inverted micelle. These PC molecules, which adopt a cylindrical molecular shape [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], are probably drawn inside these inverted micelles to minimize the extreme curvature of a CL-generated internal micelle surface, which would have not occurred had only CL molecules been involved. Such inverted micelles which contain phospholipids immobilized by a cytotoxin agrees with our <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signal B and previous studies in PC+CL membranes. In brief, these studies suggest that it takes approximately 10 to 12 lipids to cover charged and polar surface areas of CTII [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in mitochondrial membranes and in PC+CL liposomes. Inverted micelles containing cytotoxins in their core regions may eventually mix into a lamellar phase of the OMM causing the eventual release of cytotoxins into the inter-membrane space. Although we do not have direct experimental evidence for this translocation, the observation that CTI and CTII can immobilize a significant percent of total mitochondrial phospholipids (14.3% and 19.7% respectfully), most of which is likely CL at a higher concentration than what is normally found in the OMM (3&#x02013;4%), suggest that cytotoxins may translocate to the IMM. Such molecular events may not only destroy mitochondrial membrane integrity, but may also contribute to rapid mitochondrial fragmentation/swelling and dysfunction.</p><p>The enhanced cytotoxicity of CTII relative to CTI was previously correlated with the higher affinity of CTII for anionic phospholipids in cell membranes compared to CTI [<xref rid="pone.0129248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These observations agree with our data observed in PC+PS large unilamellar membranes (Figs <xref rid="pone.0129248.g002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129248.g003" ref-type="fig">3C and 3D</xref>). However, CTII and CTI exhibit similar biophysical effects on model membranes composed of PC+CL for forming non-bilayer structures, which agree with their ability to alter the lipid organization of mitochondrial membranes. We propose a conceptual model that suggests that CTII and CTI associate with CL on the OMM (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Although both cytotoxins show high amino acid sequence conservation, our molecular docking data suggest that other N-terminally located basic residues may confer specificity for CL and not PS or PC.</p><p>Finally, our collective data may have implications for other highly basic three fingered cytotoxins. It is plausible that a similar mechanism in other cytotoxins may allow them to interact with mitochondria as suggested by the high amino acid sequence conservation of conserved putative CL-interacting amino acids (K12 and R58) across cytotoxins from different cobra species. Moreover, the biologically active loops I and III are highly conserved (<xref rid="pone.0129248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, 42% amino acid homology for loop II vs. 50% and 100% for loops I and III). However, although more knowledge has been gained regarding the molecular mechanisms that lead to cell membrane disrupting activities in P vs. S-type cytotoxins, we recognize that additional studies are required to understand the molecular basis, or identify the molecular regions, by which cytotoxins bind to CL in mitochondrial membranes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129248.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>CTI and CTII dehydrate phospholipid membranes containing CL.</title><p>
