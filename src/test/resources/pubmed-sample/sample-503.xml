In the UK, individuals who smoke, do not engage in regular physical activity and do not consume moderate levels of alcohol and a healthy diet, are 3.5 times more likely to die over 20-years than those who do.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The costs of these behaviours to the UK health care system have been estimated to be &#x000a3;13.3bn per annum.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Recent figures from England indicate that one fifth of adults are current smokers, one third consume more than recommended levels of alcohol,[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] two-thirds do not meet recommended physical activity levels[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and almost three-quarters consume less than the recommended intake fruit and vegetables.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Unhealthy behaviours are the result of a combination of environmental constraints making some behaviours practically difficult to adopt and maintain,[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] social norms making some behaviours socially unacceptable,[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] lack of knowledge of why behaviour should be changed, and lack of skills to enable change.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, all of these explanations rest on an assumption that individuals would adopt healthy behaviours if they understood the benefits, and lived in environments that facilitated adoption.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>An additional explanation of poor engagement with healthy behaviours is that individuals make a rational decision not to engage, based on their assessment of the benefits to them. Thus, it is suggested that individuals weigh up the likely benefits of any particular health-promoting behaviour against their assessment of the other, uncontrollable, risks to their health to which they are exposed. Those who believe they are exposed to substantial uncontrollable risks to their health may make a rational judgement that the additional benefits of adopting any particular health-promoting behaviour is likely to be minimal. In contrast, those who believe that such uncontrollable risks are minimal will weigh the relative benefit of healthy behaviours as greater.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118782.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>We are aware of only one previous study exploring the association between perceived risks to health and health behaviours.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This cross-sectional study, using a convenience sample, found that lower perceived levels of uncontrollable risks to health were associated with greater reported efforts to improve health.</p><p>Here we use individuals&#x02019; assessments of their estimated remaining lifespan (&#x02018;anticipated survival&#x02019;) as a marker of subjective judgements of uncontrollable risks to health given their current circumstances. This is a less nuanced marker of uncontrollable risks to health as than used previously&#x02014;where the difference between anticipated survival given no personal effort to protect health, and maximal possible personal effort to protect health was used. We discuss the implications of this in the Discussion section.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We explore cross-sectional associations between anticipated survival and health behaviours in a population-representative cohort of older English adults. We hypothesised that greater anticipated survival is cross-sectionally associated with healthier behaviours.</p><p>A cross-sectional association between anticipated survival and health behaviours is open to the possibility of &#x02018;reverse-causation&#x02019;&#x02014;where healthy behaviours result in longer anticipated survival, in addition to, or instead of, longer anticipated survival resulting in healthy behaviours. To reduce the possibility of this, we explore the longitudinal relationship between anticipated survival and change in health behaviours over eight years of follow up. We hypothesised that greater anticipated survival increases the probability that behaviours will be &#x02018;healthier&#x02019; and decreases the probability that behaviours will become &#x02018;less healthy&#x02019; over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Data source and inclusion criteria</title><p>The English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA) is a prospective cohort study designed to be representative of individuals aged 50 or older living in private households in England.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118782.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Data from waves 1 and 5, collected in 2002&#x02013;03 and 2010&#x02013;11, were used.

Due to response spikes at 25%, 50%, and 75%, responses were grouped into tertiles for analysis: low (0&#x02013;33% chance of survival), moderate (33&#x02013;66%), and high (66&#x02013;100%). Differences in the target age that individuals were asked about can be taken into account by controlling for the difference between current and target age.

At wave 5, this question was reworded to: &#x0201c;How often have you had an alcoholic drink of any kind in the last 12 months?&#x0201d;, with response options of not at all, once or twice a year, every couple of months, once or twice a month, once or twice a week, three or four times a week, five or six times a week, and almost every day. These two coding systems were harmonised into: not at all; less than once a month; once or twice a month; once or twice a week; and more than twice a week.</p><p>For brevity, we use the term &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; to describe not smoking, being more physically active or consuming alcohol less frequently; and &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019; to describe alternate behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Demographic, health and socio-economic variables</title><p>A range of potential confounding factors were included that have previously been reported to be associated with anticipated survival, health behaviours, or both.</p><p>Self-reported gender was coded as male or female.

Instrumental ADL (IADL) score was calculated from the number of difficulties due to health problems with using a map, preparing a hot meal, grocery shopping, making telephone calls, taking medications, doing housework or gardening, and managing money (score 0&#x02013;7).[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Both ADL and IADL scores were collapsed into 0, 1&#x02013;2, or 3+ difficulties for analysis.</p><p>Self-rated health was assessed using the question &#x0201c;Would you say your health is&#x02026;&#x0201d; with response options of excellent, very good, good, fair or poor.

Separate models were run for each behaviour, with behaviours as outcome variables and anticipated survival, and potential confounders, included as explanatory variables. In these models behaviours are coded with higher scores representing &#x02018;more&#x02019; of each behaviour (i.e. smoking, being more physically active or consuming alcohol more frequently).</p><p>To determine the association between anticipated survival and change in health behaviours, we first calculated change variables for each behaviour in three categories: change to less healthy behaviour, no change, and change to more healthy behaviour. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between anticipated survival at wave 1 and change variables, adjusted for baseline behaviour throughout. As before, separate models were run for each behaviour.</p><p>In both groups of models, potential interactions between anticipated survival and other explanatory variables were explored, but none were found.

However, anticipated survival did not have a cross-sectional association with alcohol consumption.</p><p>As hypothesised, lower anticipated survival was associated with increased probability of taking up smoking and decreased probability of adopting healthier patterns of physical activity. However, there was no association between anticipated survival and change in alcohol consumption.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Strengths and limitations of methods</title><p>Data from a large, population-based cohort study was used. This increases the representativeness and generalisability of the findings. It also allowed consideration of both cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships. Together these represent significant methodological improvements on the only previous work we are aware of on this topic.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Given the distinct possibility of reverse causation in this context, longitudinal data were particularly valuable. However, we can not exclude the possibility that intention to change (or not change) behaviour in the future influenced both baseline anticipated survival, and change in behaviours over time. Thus, whilst our longitudinal analyses provide stronger evidence on direction of causation than our cross-sectional analyses, the possibility of reverse causation can not be entirely excluded.</p><p>Despite the use of a large cohort, some behaviour changes were rare (particularly in relation to smoking) leaving small numbers in some cells (see <xref rid="pone.0118782.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This was particularly noticeable in the older, less populated, age groups and exacerbated by the large number of predictors in our fully adjusted models. This means that some of our analyses may have been underpowered. Larger cohorts would be required to overcome this problem.</p><p>The measures of health behaviours used were self-reported throughout. This is likely to result in error, reducing our ability to detect differences where these may exist. Whilst responses to these questions may also be biased, it is likely that any such bias is consistent over time, making the longitudinal analyses less susceptible to misclassification than the cross-sectional analyses.</p><p>The variable target age that participants were asked to consider in the question used to determine anticipated survival means that like may not have been compared with like across participants. To explore this, the analyses were repeated additionally controlling for the difference between target age and age at data collection. This had no impact on the findings.</p><p>It is not clear that anticipated survival, as measured here, is necessarily an accurate measure of perceived uncontrollable threats to health. We used this variable as it was included in the ELSA dataset and allowed us to exploit this population-representative data source. Other authors have asked participants to estimate their anticipated survival if they were to make both maximal and minimal efforts to protect their health and using the difference between these as an estimate of uncontrollable threats to health.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Our measure of anticipated survival is likely to capture the impact of any intention to change health behaviours in the future, as well as uncontrollable threats to health. It may, therefore, underestimate true uncontrollable threats to health. If the degree of underestimation varies by socio-demographic variables, this could introduce bias. Although previous work suggests that anticipated survival correlates well with actual survival in this cohort,[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] further qualitative work is required to explore how individuals arrive at their judgements of anticipated survival and inform the development of accurate quantitative measures of uncontrollable threats to health.</p><p>A wide range of potential confounding variables were included in the analyses. However, as with any epidemiological analysis, the possibility of uncontrolled confounding cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Comparison of findings to previous research and interpretation of findings</title><p>Although some support was found for both of the hypotheses, support was not consistent across all health behaviours. In particular, effects in relation to alcohol consumption were absent.</p><p>The lack of statistically significant findings in relation to smoking, in particular, may indicate a lack of statistical power. Only 16% of the sample smoked at baseline and only 7% changed their smoking behaviour between waves 1 and 5 (see <xref rid="pone.0118782.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast 44% of participants changed frequency of alcohol consumption and 52% changed frequency of physical activity levels between waves 1 and 5. These differences may reflect the larger number of alcohol consumption and physical activity categories available&#x02014;such that small changes in these behaviours, but not smoking, could be identified&#x02014;as well as the relative difficulty of changing different behaviours.</p><p>Those reporting low anticipated survival were less likely to change to healthier patterns of physical activity and more likely to adopt smoking than those reporting moderate anticipated survival. It is possible that these relationships reflect uncontrolled confounding by poor health status. For example, those in poor health at baseline, who are likely to report poorer anticipated survival, may have had mobility limitations that restricted their ability to become more active. As we adjusted for a wide range of health variables at baseline we believe this is unlikely&#x02014;but the possibility can not be excluded.</p><p>The finding that there were no relationship between anticipated survival and alcohol consumption may reflect the more complex association between alcohol and health than between both smoking and physical activity health, as well as public understanding of these relationships. In general less smoking and more physical activity is associated with better health, however there is a &#x02018;j-shaped&#x02019; relationship between alcohol consumption and health outcomes with both high and low alcohol consumption appearing to be associated with poorer outcomes.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In addition, higher than recommended alcohol consumption tends to be viewed as normal and acceptable in the UK.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118782.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In contrast, the majority of the population recognise smoking as harmful to health[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and physical activity as beneficial.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The shape of the relationship between alcohol consumption and health, and the public&#x02019;s understand of this, is, therefore, more complex than those between both smoking and physical activity and health.</p><p>In the fully adjusted longitudinal analyses, those reporting low anticipated survival showed some differences in behaviour change compared to those reporting moderate anticipated survival, but no differences were found between those reporting moderate and high anticipated survival. We also found that reporting low versus moderate anticipated survival was the most important predictor of true survival (rather than high versus moderate).[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] There appears to be something particularly predictive of death about reporting low anticipated survival that may influence both motivation and ability to pursue healthy behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Implications of findings for research and practice</title><p>The findings reported here may be particular to older populations and it would be valuable to replicate them in cohorts reflecting the full age spectrum. Focusing on groups of individuals at high &#x02018;risk&#x02019; of behaviour change (e.g. those taking part in specific behaviour change interventions) may also provide more statistical power. Future work should also explore how individuals arrive at their assessment of their anticipated survival, what factors they take into account when considering anticipated survival, and whether this is a good marker of perceived uncontrollable threats to health.</p><p>Our results suggest that individual assessments of uncontrollable threats to health may be important determinants of change in some health behaviours, particularly smoking and physical activity. Previous work suggests that the assessments of anticipated survival that we used as a proxy of uncontrollable threats to health tend to be accurate.[<xref rid="pone.0118782.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] As such, individually-focused behaviour change interventions are unlikely to be able to address this particular determinant of health behaviours and health behaviour change. Wider, population-level, changes to systemic and societal factors, are likely to be necessary to change these variables. Achieving change in these factors requires consistent political will over the long term.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a representative cohort of older English adults, greater anticipated survival was cross-sectionally association with lower likelihood of smoking and higher physical activity levels. However, anticipated survival did not have a cross-sectional association with alcohol consumption. Over eight years of follow up, lower anticipated survival was associated with increased probability of taking up smoking, and decreased probability of adopting healthier patterns of physical activity. There was no longitudinal association between anticipated survival and alcohol consumption.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0118782.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
