When added noise is present only during the stimulus, an additional enhancement can be reached. This phenomenon was called time Coincidence Enhanced Stochastic Resonance (CESR). The aim of this study was to study the effect of spatially distributed vibrotactile noise in subthreshold stimuli detection. The correct response rates from two different stimuli conditions were compared, using four tactile stimulator systems to excite four different spatial locations on the fingertip. Under two different conditions, the stimuli were present in only one randomly chosen stimulator. For the first condition, all stimulators contain optimal noise level. In the second condition, the optimal noise was present only at the stimulator with the stimulus. SR threshold principle should not produce different correct response rates between the two conditions, since in both cases the noise enables the subthreshold stimulus to go above threshold. The stimulus signal used was a rectangular displacement controlled pulse that lasted 300ms within a 1.5s attention interval, applied to the exploratory zone of the index finger of 13 human subjects. For all subjects it was found that detection rates were better (p&#x0003c;0.0003) when noise was spatially coincident with the stimulus, compared to the condition in which noise was present simultaneously in all the stimulators. According to our literature review this is the first report of SR being influenced by the spatial location of the noise. These results were not found previously reported, so represent the discovery of a new phenomenon. We call this phenomenon Spatial-Coincidence-Enhanced Stochastic Resonance (SCESR). As results show, the optimal noise level is dependent on the relative position between stimulus and noise.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fondecyt</institution></funding-source><award-id>1080593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Claudio A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded in part by Fondecyt grant No. 1080593 and by the Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are available from Open Science Framework at the following URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/usgjm/">https://osf.io/usgjm/</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are available from Open Science Framework at the following URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/usgjm/">https://osf.io/usgjm/</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stochastic resonance (SR) is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which the addition of certain amount of noise increases detection of weak signals in some nonlinear systems such as touch [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is multiple experimental evidence that SR occurs in the human tactile system [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In that experimental evidence, authors used a subthreshold mechanical stimulus in the form of pulse and mechanical noise in the form of random vibrations. They demonstrated that true positive detection rates were higher for certain levels of noise added to the subthreshold stimuli signal. During the last years, SR has been demonstrated in the human tactile system, in fingertips, soles of the feet, lips, tongue, and many other glabrous skin regions of the human body and in other senses as well [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SR phenomena are commonly explained assuming that noise works as a pedestal allowing weak signals to exceed sensory thresholds [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Perez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] performed an experiment using a pulse type mechanical stimulus, with amplitude below tactile threshold and optimal mechanical noise, which produced SR, under two different conditions. In the first condition, noise was present throughout the attention interval; in the second condition, noise was present only during the stimulus time interval. Previous SR studies found no difference for these two conditions [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; however, the authors found that detection rates were higher when the noise was synchronized with the stimulus. As a possible explanation for this novel phenomenon, the authors postulated in [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that noise coincident with the stimuli might reduce Temporal Uncertainty (TU), according to the sensorial model proposed by Tanner [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The sensory detection enhancement produced by temporal coincidence between stimuli and noise raises the question of whether a similar phenomenon would be present for spatially coincident stimulus and noise. Spatially coincident noise might help to reduce Spatial Uncertainty (SU) and therefore expect enhanced detection for this new condition.</p><p>The objective of the present study is to test predictions made from the SR model under two different conditions: In the first condition, the noise was applied at the stimulus location and at the other three locations, and the other with the noise coincident at the same spatial location as that of the rectangular pulse stimulus. By using a four mechanical stimulator system in the first condition, the stimulus is present in only one of the four stimulators, while noise is present in the four stimulators simultaneously during the whole attention interval. In the second condition, the noise is present only at the same position as the stimulus. Since the use of optimal noise would help subthreshold stimuli to exceed sensory detection level [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in both conditions, SR theory does not predict differences between the two conditions. Nevertheless, our results show that positive detection rates are higher in the second condition when noise is spatially coincident with the stimulus, compared to the first condition in which noise is present in all the stimulators.</p><p>Although there are some previous studies on the effects of SU [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], on subthreshold stimuli detection, they focus on visual perception and not on the human tactile system. Therefore, our proposed study is novel according to our literature review.</p><p>Analysis of the relation between SR and SU could contribute to explain the results reached in this study and help explore new phenomena that have not been predicted by SR. Additionally, the study of this phenomenon could lead to a better understanding of human tactile perception, leading to improvements in haptic interface development, diagnostic tools, prosthesis design, and human mimetic transducers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 13 subjects, 1 female and 12 male, with ages between 22 and 39 years participated in our experiment.

In one case, noise was added to the stimulus signal at the same location as the stimulus signal. In the other case, noise was added simultaneously to all four stimulators, not just to the one that carried the pulse stimulus. In both cases, noise was present during the whole 1.5s attention interval. A yes/no task [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was performed for each case and the percentage of correct responses, P(C), was computed from a total of 40 trials for every single noise level. Half of the trials contained the stimulus signal plus noise and the other half contained only noise. Therefore, a correct response occurred when the subject&#x02019;s answer was &#x02018;yes&#x02019; when the stimulus was present, and when the subject&#x02019;s answer is &#x02018;no&#x02019; and the stimulus was not present.

This is a novel finding that has not been reported previously according to our literature review.</p><p>Previously, the <italic>&#x0201c;Coincidence-Enhanced Stochastic Resonance (CESR)&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] has been described as the phenomenon in which temporal synchronization of noise with the stimulus can improve response in tactile detection tasks. We propose the term Spatial-Coincidence-Enhanced Stochastic Resonance (SCESR) to describe this novel phenomenon. In the literature we found that, for other human senses, the additional spatial information, such as perceptional hints, effectively reduces spatial uncertainty [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further, according to [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], detection tasks may be improved, as long is additional information intended to reduce the memory.</p><p>As an alternative possibility to explain this effect we should consider that for conditions C1 and C2, mechanical noise applied at the stimulators might mechanically spread laterally through the skin and, by superimposing, produce some effect on overall magnitude of skin fluctuations. That interaction might produce an increase or decrease of perceived magnitude of tactile stimulation; let&#x02019;s consider tactile perception thresholds for noise measured in experiment 1: when noise is applied on four stimulators simultaneously, the threshold is about half than when it&#x02019;s applied in only one stimulator. Hence we can infer that the effect of stimulating multiple nearby points on finger skin produces an increase in overall perceived magnitude. Now let&#x02019;s observe the results for experiment 2: for all 13 subjects, a stochastic resonance point was found, that is, there was an optimal noise level that produces correct detection rates above chance, for both noise in one stimulator and for noise on four stimulators; in both cases the optimal noise levels were below perception threshold. For experiment 3, the noise level used for conditions C1 and C2 was the one which produced the higher P(C1) + P(C2) on experiment 2, and for conditions C3 and C4 the noise level was the one which produced the higher P(C3)+P(C4) on experiment 2. But the correct detection rates found on experiment 3 where significantly higher for conditions C3 and C4 than those obtained for conditions C1 and C2. Hence, in opposition to results in experiment 1, from experiment 3 we might infer that the effect of stimulating multiple nearby points on finger skin produces a decrease in overall perceived magnitude. Thus it&#x02019;s not completely clear if the overall effect of adding noise simultaneously on four nearby stimulation points would produce an increase or decrease on overall perceived magnitude, so further investigation and measurements must be performed to clearly assess this effect.</p><p>The spatial arrangement of stimulators used on these experiments is similar to tactile sense as the ones used by Cohn in [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Phu in [<xref rid="pone.0186932.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who studied the effects of SU on detectability on visual sense; Cohn and Phu found that using signal stimulus that may aid to reduce SU effectively increases detection rates of visual stimuli from different positions on space. Despite using different stimuli source arrangements than this work, all of them, including ours, are selected such as stimulates different receptive fields. However in our experiment subjects were unable to successfully identify the position of the tactile stimuli, so we cannot asseverate that a reduction on SU can be achieved by the methods here exposed. The results of the 4AFC task are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186932.g012">Fig 12</xref>, where subjects were required to identify the position where the stimulus was.</p><fig id="pone.0186932.g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0186932.g012</object-id><label>Fig 12</label><caption><title>Percentage of correct answers on 4AFC task.</title><p>Subjects were asked to identify the position where the stimulus was.

The effect of putting 4 punctate stimulators in very close proximity to each other still requires an interpretation, but the effect of putting 4 close stimulators together caused the noise perception threshold to be significantly reduced, so it would be logical to think that in that situation there would be more positive detections than when the noise is present in only one stimulator, however the opposite occurred, so the effect of putting the 4 stimulators close to each other is not completely clear.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>New evidence is presented in this work for improvement in the detection of a subthreshold tactile stimulus (Experiment 3 for condition C3) in the presence of spatially coincident noise. We showed that detection improvement is greater when the noise is spatially coincident with the tactile stimulus compared to the situation in which the noise was spatially distributed as in condition C1. Our experimental results showed an interesting phenomenon; while multiple sources of noise increases the overall perceived magnitude when noise perception threshold is measured, the same spatial distribution of noise sources apparently decrease the overall perceived magnitude in detection tasks using tactile stochastic resonance. Additional investigation and experimental data are required to find a possible explanation to this phenomenon.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded in part by Fondecyt grant No.1080593 and by the Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0186932.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cohn</surname><given-names>TE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name>, <article-title>Donoso.
