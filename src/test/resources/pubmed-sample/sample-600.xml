EV68 was first isolated in 1962 from 4 pediatric patients hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infection, in California <xref rid="pone.0074221-Schieble1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Since then, EV68 has been identified only sporadically. In the enterovirus surveillance conducted in the United States from 1970 to 2005, only 26 strains were reported over 35 years <xref rid="pone.0074221-Khetsuriani1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, the number of reported EV68 cases has remarkably increased in recent years <xref rid="pone.0074221-Centers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Between 2008 and 2009, we detected EV68 in 21 pediatric patients who were hospitalized with severe pneumonia in the Philippines <xref rid="pone.0074221-Imamura1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Increased EV68 detection has been reported from different parts of the world, including the United States <xref rid="pone.0074221-Tokarz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, Europe <xref rid="pone.0074221-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Piralla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, Africa <xref rid="pone.0074221-Tokarz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and Asia <xref rid="pone.0074221-Ikeda1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Linsuwanon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, it remains elusive whether this increasing trend was due to a real increase of cases or increased detection owing to improvement in detection methods such as usage of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Retrospective analysis of stored respiratory specimens by PCR revealed detection of EV68 every year in the Netherlands since 1996 <xref rid="pone.0074221-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and in Yamagata, Japan since 2005 <xref rid="pone.0074221-Ikeda1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, with smaller number of positive cases before the increased detections in 2010 at each study site. However, it is still unknown whether those viruses detected each year had been maintained in the community or newly introduced.</p><p>Majority of reported EV68 cases were associated with acute respiratory infections including a considerable number of severe cases especially among children. A total of 5 fatal cases have been reported so far, including 2 pediatric patients hospitalized with pneumonia in the Philippines <xref rid="pone.0074221-Imamura1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Lauinger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Kreuter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In one previous study among the patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in the Netherlands, detection rate of EV68 was significantly higher in ARI patients with bronchiolitis compared to those without it <xref rid="pone.0074221-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, which suggested that EV68 might be more frequently associated with severe clinical symptoms. In the study, EV68 detection rate was highest among patients aged 50&#x02013;59 years and it was the lowest among those aged younger than 10 years. In a study conducted in Thailand, EV68 was more likely to be detected among hospitalized pediatric patients compared to children who consulted outpatient clinics <xref rid="pone.0074221-Linsuwanon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, which concurred with the report from the Netherlands. However, the etiological significance of EV68 is yet to be determined. Therefore, the current study aimed at investigating the molecular evolution of circulating EV68 viruses in the Philippines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>2.1.

In this study, we detected EV68 at the same study site between June and August 2011. Even though the overall detection rate was low (0.23%), all cases were detected over a period of 3 months. Moreover, the detection rate among hospitalized cases was higher (9/1,187, 0.76% of pediatric cases and 2/456, 0.44% of adult cases) than outpatients (1/3,597, 0.028%) (<italic>p&#x02264;</italic>0.0001), suggesting that EV68 was more likely to be associated with severe respiratory infections. The hospitalized patients positive for EV68 presented severe respiratory symptoms, and among pediatric patients, the SPO<sub>2</sub> values were considerably lower than the reference value (95%&#x02013;100%) of healthy infants and children <xref rid="pone.0074221-Fouzas1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, unlike the previous study from Thailand, interestingly we did not detect any mixed infection with aforementioned viruses in our clinical samples <xref rid="pone.0074221-Linsuwanon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Combined with our previous report, increased detections of EV68 were observed twice during the 4 year study period, with an interval of approximately 2 years, and no positive cases were detected between those two periods with EV68 detections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074221-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Possibly, EV68 recurrence follows a cyclic pattern as suggested by the retrospective analysis of stored samples in Japan and the Netherlands <xref rid="pone.0074221-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Ikeda1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, in these studies, a small number of cases were detected even between periods with increased EV68 detections.</p><p>In 2008 and 2009, majority of the detected EV68 belonged to lineage 2, and only one strain was classified into lineage 3 on the phylogenetic tree based on VP1 sequences. In 2011, most of the detected EV68 shared high similarities in VP1 sequences and also classified into lineage 2, however, two strains of lineage 3 were also detected. These results indicated that EV68 of lineages 2 and 3 were co-circulating in the study area during both 2008&#x02013;09 and 2011. In the VP1 amino acid sequences detected from the Philippines, nonsynonymous substitutions were commonly found in BC- and DE-loop regions, and unique amino acid sequences in those regions were associated with the categorization of detected strains into different lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074221.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which was in line with the previous report from Thailand <xref rid="pone.0074221-Linsuwanon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It was previously reported that genotype replacement is associated with occurrence of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) outbreaks <xref rid="pone.0074221-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In our study, such replacement of EV68 lineages was not observed between two periods of increased detection, therefore, the mechanism for increased detections is still unclear. Observation of longer period is required to reveal the relationship between circulating lineages and increased detections of EV68.</p><p>One of the strains detected in the Philippines in 2011 (TTa-11-Ph257) belonged to lineage 2 on the phylogenetic tree based on VP1 sequences, however, its 5&#x02032;UTR sequences were closely related to strains whose VP1 sequences were classified as lineage 3 (TX03, SA1354 and TTa-08-Ph561). This variation may be due to the recombination which is common among members of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family <xref rid="pone.0074221-Lindberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, we could not make any conclusions since we only amplified partial genome of 5&#x02032;UTR and VP1 of this strain. The role of recombination in evolution of EV68 is yet to be defined.</p><p>Among EV68 detected in the study, 5 in lineage 2 formed a cluster which diverged from the cluster of EV68 detected in 2008&#x02013;09 in the Philippines, on the Bayesian tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074221-g003">Figure 3</xref>). However, 2 strains from the Philippines which belonged to lineage 3 were not diverged from viruses detected in the Philippines in 2008 and they were more closely related to viruses found in New York, the United States. This result suggests that these strains might have been newly introduced into the community. For other respiratory viruses, strains migration at global level is well documented. For examples, molecular epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) indicated that specific genotype BA of subgroup B has widely spread to different parts of the world <xref rid="pone.0074221-Trento1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Trento2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074221-Ohno1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Despite the geographical distance between New York and Leyte Island, the Philippines, it is still possible that EV68 transmission had occurred at global level. However, number of analyzed sequences in lineage 3 was too small to draw any conclusion.</p><p>In conclusion, despite the low detection rate, our study indicated etiological importance of EV68 as a potential causative agent of severe respiratory infections. In addition, increased detections of EV68 in one area were identified twice with a 2-year interval, which suggests that viruses might have been maintained in the community. Given the fact that most of the detected sequences in 2011 were closely associated with those detected in 2008, cyclic patterns of EV68 detections might be due to the accumulation of susceptible population in the community. Our study also indicates that transmission of EV68 at global level and introduction of new strains into the community might be an alternative mechanism for increased detections of EV68. Continuous monitoring is thus required to reveal the etiological importance of EV68 and the mechanisms of its emergence in cyclic patterns in the community.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0074221.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
