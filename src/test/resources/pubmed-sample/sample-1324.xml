This study characterizes the effects of non-thermal plasma exposure on acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent quorum sensing (QS). Plasma exposure of AHLs reduced the ability of such molecules to elicit a QS response in bacterial reporter strains in a dose-dependent manner. Short exposures (30&#x02013;60&#x02009;s) produce of a series of secondary compounds capable of eliciting a QS response, followed by the complete loss of AHL-dependent signalling following longer exposures. UPLC-MS analysis confirmed the time-dependent degradation of AHL molecules and their conversion into a series of by-products. FT-IR analysis of plasma-exposed AHLs highlighted the appearance of an OH group. <italic>In vivo</italic> assessment of the exposure of AHLs to plasma was examined using a standard <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Lettuce leaves injected with the <italic>rhlI/lasI</italic> mutant PAO-MW1 alongside plasma treated N-butyryl-homoserine lactone and n-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-homoserine lactone, exhibited marked attenuation of virulence. This study highlights the capacity of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma to modify and degrade AHL autoinducers thereby attenuating QS-dependent virulence in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The ability to generate chemically rich plasmas at or near ambient temperature and their demonstrated ability to influence biological processes has led to increasing interest in their use in a range of clinical interventions, and to the emergence of the nascent field of plasma medicine. The term &#x02018;plasma medicine&#x02019; describes the emerging multidisciplinary field of study that examines the applicability and use of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasmas in biomedical applications and more specifically in the treatment of viable tissue. The potential uses of atmospheric plasmas in biomedical applications include skin decontamination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, wound treatments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, surface disinfection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and invasive surgical treatments of tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The physical and reactive chemistry of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma is derived from the production of an electric field capable of ionising air or a carrier gas such as helium/argon at atmospheric pressure. This ionisation process leads to the formation of photons, electrons, reactive species, electromagnetic energy and charged particles at a low temperature (sub 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Ambient temperatures are possible due to the inefficient transfer of energy between gas particles and electrons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The efficacy of non-thermal plasma in proposed applications ranging from treatment of solid tumours, modification of cell proliferation and migration for wound healing, sterilisation and blood coagulation relies on the synergistic action of the localised generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), electromagnetic energy, charged particles and UV light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Central to the development of plasma medicine, are fundamental studies between living systems (microorganisms, cells and tissue) and the reactive chemistry of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Most medical applications of plasmas stem from its antimicrobial action. Studies have demonstrated tremendous efficacy against a range of clinically relevant microorganisms, in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and bacterial cellular targets for plasmas&#x02019; antimicrobial mode of action have been proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Whilst the antibacterial action of non-thermal plasma is well characterised, relatively little attention has been paid to investigating the consequences of short plasma exposures on surviving microorganisms and their biomolecules. Recently Zuizana <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> described the potential of plasma to reduce the activity of QS controlled virulence factors in <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> However, there are, as yet, no reports of the ability of cold atmospheric plasma to directly affect quorum sensing molecules and their resulting activity in Gram negative bacteria.</p><p>Quorum sensing is utilised by bacteria to monitor cell density and co-ordinate bacterial behaviour at a community level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. From a clinical perspective, regulation of pathogenicity and virulence through QS-dependent mechanisms provides a strategy to &#x02018;disarm&#x02019; pathogenic microorganisms attenuating their virulence and rendering them more susceptible to antibiotics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, without necessarily placing them under direct selective pressure. Bacterial QS is reliant on the production and metabolism of signalling molecules (known as autoinducers), the identity of which is distinct between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive bacteria such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> synthesise and respond to oligopeptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, whereas Gram-negative bacteria primarily rely on acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as the primary signalling molecules involved in QS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. AHLs comprise a lactone ring ligated to an acyl carbon chain through an amide bond, with the acyl chain varying in carbon length, saturation or oxidation state depending on bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The AHL-dependent QS signalling pathways of Gram-negative bacteria rely on three main components; a gene coding for the synthase responsible for generating the AHL signalling molecule (LuxI-type gene), the signalling molecule itself and the cognate cytoplasmic receptor (LuxR-type transcription factor)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. This system offers three main putative targets for potential inhibition/interference of bacterial QS. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>&#x02019;s AHL-dependent QS pathways are well-characterised and provide a relevant example of QS in pathogenic bacteria. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>&#x02019;s QS circuitry consists of two hierarchically-organized AHL systems (<italic>lasIR</italic> and <italic>rhlIR</italic>) which utilise AHL signalling molecules n-(3-oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone and n-butyryl-homoserine lactone, as well as a third 2-alkyl-4-quinolone regulated system, known as the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> quinolone signal (PQS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. These hierarchal systems control production of virulence factors such as elastase, pyoverdin (<italic>las</italic> controlled), rhamnolipid and pyocyanin (<italic>rhl</italic> controlled)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown reduced pathogenicity in chronic infections, through inhibition of bacterial QS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Inhibition or interference of quorum sensing is thus a novel, attractive and promising strategy in the treatment of bacterial infections.</p><p>In this study, the residual activity of AHL molecules; n-butyryl-homoserine lactone (BHL), n-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (HHL), n-octanoyl-homoserine lactone (OHL) and n-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) following plasma exposure was examined using the following QS reporter strains: <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> ATCC BAA-2240, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JM109 pSB536, pSB401 and pSB1142, and <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> (CV026). The double <italic>lasI</italic>/<italic>rhlI</italic> QS mutant of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, PAO-MW1, was used to determine the capacity of plasma-exposed AHLs to restore QS-dependent virulence factor production and the virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa in vivo</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> provides a schematic representation of the overall experimental design. The data presented here demonstrate, for the first time, that short plasma exposures rapidly alter both the physicochemical characteristics and the ability of AHLs to elicit QS signalling in bacterial reporter strains. Analysis of plasma-exposed AHLs by UPLC-MS and FT-IR analysis, in conjunction with plasma chemical characterization demonstrates that the interaction of plasma-derived reactive species with these molecules leads to degradation of the parent AHL, resulting in attenuation of AHL-dependent QS and virulence factor production in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plasma exposed HHL detection using CV026</title><p>CV026 is a mini-Tn5 mutant, in which QS-dependent violacein production can be restored via the addition of exogenous AHLs with acyl side chains from four to eight carbons, with varying sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. QS bio-reporter strains are commonly utilized to detect AHL production by various Gram-negative bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The use of reporter strains to perform thin layer chromatography (TLC) -overlays of AHLs provides a simple and rapid technique used to identify AHL activity and can provide insights into the physicochemical properties of AHLs. Initially, the TLC-overlay assay was used to assess the bio-activity of plasma exposed HHL. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> displays the results of plasma exposed HHL using CV026. Following 30&#x02009;seconds exposure to plasma, violacein synthesis by CV026 was clearly reduced and no observable violacein production was apparent following 60&#x02009;seconds of exposure suggesting the complete inactivation/conversion of HHL.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Detection of plasma treated BHL, HHL, OHL and OdDHL bio-activity using <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> TLC-overlay</title><p>QS- reporter systems can be limited by the specificity for their cognate cytoplasmic receptors and AHL. The QS based receptors of these reporter strains are most efficiently activated by their cognate autoinducer, however analogues with varied chain length and oxidation/saturation state of the acyl chain may also elicit a response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 contains the <italic>traR</italic> gene with the fusion of the promoters <italic>traG:lacZ</italic>, which in the presence of exogenous AHLs synthesises &#x003b2;-galactosidase.

In fact, this reporter strain is routinely used for the detection of AHLs produced by Gram-negative bacterial isolates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Due to the broader sensitivity of <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240, this reporter was exploited to characterise the effect of APNTP exposure on all AHLs used in this study (BHL, HHL, OHL and OdDHL). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows the plasma mediated effect on (a) BHL, (b) HHL, (c) OHL and (d) OdDHL using TLCs overlaid with <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 alongside threshold images using ImageJ, in order to clearly identify the plasma-mediated changes to AHL activity.</p><p>Similarly to the reduction in pigment production observed when overlaying plasma-treated HHL with CV026, the overlay of treated BHL resulted in a gradual reduction in response by <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 (reduced pigment zone size) with increasing exposure times. Following 120&#x02009;seconds of exposure, the plasma-treated BHL was no longer capable of eliciting a visible turnover of the X-Gal substrate in this reporter. The overlay of plasma-treated HHL, OHL and OdDHL produced a different response when compared to the plasma treated BHL. In fact, there was an immediate effect on the AHL molecules after 30&#x02009;seconds exposure with the generation of diffuse comet shaped zones. These diffuse comet shaped response zones covered a larger area than the control, and when compared to the untreated controls, an extensive migration of the plasma treated HHL, OHL and OdDHL was observed. With increasing plasma exposure the pigment zones decreased in size for HHL, OHL, OdDHL, with no detectable activity for OHL and OdDHL after 240 and 120&#x02009;seconds plasma exposure respectively. Plasma treated HHL was still capable of eliciting a visible response in the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 reporter even after 240&#x02009;seconds of exposure to plasma highlighting the differences in sensitivity when compared to the CV026 reporter. However, the response zone obtained from 240&#x02009;seconds plasma treated HHL overlaid with <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA is smaller compared to the untreated control, suggesting a gradual inactivation over increasing exposure times. The plasma treated HHL also appears to have a different migration suggesting either the oxidation of the acyl side chain or chain shortening effects. Lactone ring opening would be expected to result in complete loss of pigment production and may be responsible for the loss of signal at longer AHL exposure times.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantification of the bioactivity of plasma exposed HHL, OHL and OdDHL using luminescence-based reporters <italic>E. coli</italic> strains pSB 536, 401 and 1142</title><p>Bioluminescence assays using <italic>E. coli</italic> strains pSB536 (BHL), pSB401 (HHL, OHL) and pSB1142 (OdDHL) reporter strains were used to quantify the residual bioactivity of plasma-treated BHL, HHL, OHL and OdDHL. <italic>E. coli</italic> pSB536 contains the <italic>ahyR ahyI::luxCDABE</italic> which responds to short chain AHLs primarily BHL. <italic>E. coli</italic> JM109 pSB401 is a recombinant based AHL biosensor, were the <italic>luxR</italic> and <italic>lux</italic> promoter region from <italic>Photobacterium fischeri</italic> is coupled to the entire <italic>lux</italic> operon (<italic>LuxCDABE)</italic> from <italic>Photorhabdus luminescenc</italic>s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.

To date no studies have investigated the effects of short exposures (where complete eradication is not achieved) of non-thermal plasma on bacterial QS directly, a crucial regulatory mechanism utilised by numerous bacterial pathogens to regulate virulence and biofilm formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In this study, a panel of QS bio-reporter strains capable of responding to the acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signalling molecules, alongside chemical analysis (FTIR analysis and UHPLC-MS) were used to interrogate the effects atmospheric plasma treatment has on BHL, HHL, OHL and OdDHL signalling molecules. Plasma exposed AHLs were examined for their residual capacity to elicit a QS-dependent response <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as their capacity to control virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> using a lettuce leaf virulence model. FTIR and UHPLC-MS analysis provided structural insights into the plasma-induced modification of these molecules which, when combined with the physical and chemical characterization of the plasma and of the ROS produced by the plasma, provides valuable insight into the reactive species responsible for the structural effects observed.</p><p>The TLC overlay assay of plasma-exposed HHL using the CV026 reporter strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) suggests the gradual inactivation and loss in bioactivity of HHL following just 60&#x02009;seconds exposure to atmospheric plasma. Interestingly, the TLC overlay assay of plasma-exposed, HHL, OHL and OdDHL using the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 bio-reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), demonstrated the presence of AHL active components with different physicochemical properties produced by plasma exposure. These results suggest the occurrence of a complex series of chemical modifications following plasma exposure, which were still capable of eliciting a QS-dependent response with the bio-reporter. In fact, when plasma-exposed HHL was run on TLC and overlaid with <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240, the reporter strain detected and responded to the exposed AHLs generating diffuse comet-like zones of pigment production with some residual activity still apparent following 240&#x02009;seconds of plasma exposure. Whereas the bio-reporter CV026 readily responds to low concentrations of HHL, it is less sensitive to BHL and OHL and requires much higher concentrations to elicit violacein biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The difference in sensitivity of these bio-reporters could explain the inconsistencies observed when comparing the results of the two assays for HHL. In fact, <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 responds to a wider range of AHLs than CV026 and at much lower concentrations including 3-oxo and 3-hydroxy derivatives of homoserine lactones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The latter observation indicates that CV026 was unable to respond to the plasma induced changes to HHL that <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 continued to respond to up to 240&#x02009;seconds. Whilst CV026 appeared to indicate a complete inactivation of the AHLs signalling potential, the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 bio-reporter was capable of responding to the AHL products produced by plasma pre-exposure.</p><p>The diffuse elliptical zones of pigment production observed on the TLC overlaid with <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 of HHL, OHL and OdDHL following plasma treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) are characteristic and indicative of the presence of 3-oxo derivatives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In fact, following 30&#x02009;seconds of plasma exposure the zones of pigment production generated by the plasma-treated AHLs change significantly in shape and distribution becoming larger, more diffuse and comet-shaped when compared to the zones of activity of the control HHL and OHL and the small elliptical zone produced by OdDHL. These results show that atmospheric plasma is capable of altering the physicochemical characteristics of these AHLs. In particular, plasma-exposed OHL and OdDHL migrated further on the RP-TLC plate indicating plasma treatment has rendered the treated molecules more hydrophilic, possibly through the addition of polar substituents, an observation which is in keeping with the presence of the OH functional group stretch shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> for all plasma treated AHLs. Plasma characterization data presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S2&#x02013;S4</xref> describe the reactive species produced in the plasma gas phase and plasma treated water and PBS. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S4</xref> demonstrate the production of 2-hydroxyterepthalic acid and pertitanic acid as indicators for the production of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide respectively. AHLs were incubated with 4&#x02009;mM hydrogen peroxide for four minutes (equivalent to the hydrogen peroxide concentration produced by plasma after 240&#x02009;s exposure) and overlaid using the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> assay. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S8</xref> demonstrates that hydrogen peroxide is not responsible for the physicochemical effects observed following plasma exposure of AHL molecules, as described in this study. Although plasma exposure of aqueous media produces a wide range of reactive specues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, the presence of an OH functional group in plasma treated AHL samples seen with FT-IR analysis correlates with the production of the fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephtalic acid from the non-fluorescent terephthalic acid, indicating the importance of the hydroxyl radical produced by the plasma as one of the reactive species responsible for the effects demonstrated. Work by Frey <italic>et al.</italic> supports this finding where they investigated the effect on signalling activity of AHLs treated with the OH radical specifically, reporting that the reaction between HHL and OHL produced several species characterised by oxidation and hydroxylation of the acyl chain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>Whilst the overlay of plasma exposed HHL, OHL and OdDHL using the reporter strain <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA2240 produced comet-like spots, plasma exposure of BHL did not give rise to this phenomenon. However the addition of OH functional groups (deduced from FT-IR) indicate a limitation in the sensitivity of the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> assay in detecting hydroxyl or oxo derivatives of BHL, in accordance to previously reported data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In contrast, the plasma treatment of BHL resulted in a reduction in response zone size with increasing exposure times and total loss of bio-activity following 60&#x02009;seconds of exposure. This chain-length dependent effect was shown using the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> assay and confirmed with UHPLC-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S9&#x02013;S10</xref>). As longer acyl side chains donate electrons more readily stabilizing AHLs against lactone ring opening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, the differences in chain length of BHL, HHL, OHL and OdDHL are also important in dictating the nature of the modifications during plasma exposure. Side chain modifications of the longer chain AHLs which are more easily oxidised occur more readily and would explain the chain length dependent decomposition of the parent AHL molecule. BHL has a short (four carbon) acyl side chain and may not be as susceptible to chain modification as AHLs with longer acyl side chains. Modifications of the lactone ring of the molecule, with possible ring opening may account for the attenuation of QS-dependent pigment production. FT-IR analysis of the lactone stretch at 1775&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> representative of the C=O present on the lactone ring is shown to gradually decrease with plasma exposure for all AHLs and its disappearance after 240&#x02009;seconds exposure of OdDHL coincides with the loss of visible QS induced response, as seen in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information Figure S7</xref> for 1&#x02009;mM plasma exposed OdDHL in PBS and water. It could then be expected that the comet like zones shown with the AHLs HHL, OHL and OdDHL may well be a combination of plasma modified AHLs with hydroxyl and oxo derivatives with varying polarities accounting. The relation between the formation of comet- like zones of response observed in the TLC overlay assays and the presence of hydroxyl and oxo derivatives on the acyl side chain is currently being investigated using UHPLC-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S10</xref>). This approach has highlighted the limitation of FT-IR analysis as whilst information can be garnered based on the presence of functional groups such as the OH group and the time dependent increase in new stretch at C=O 1720&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> it cannot distinguish between the formation of a multitude of products, supposedly responsible for the peak broadening displayed with increasing plasma exposure.</p><p>The results of the TLC-overlay using <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240, FT-IR and UHPLC-MS data following plasma exposure of the longer chain AHLs (HHL, OHL, OdDHL) suggests atmospheric plasma may readily oxidise the acyl chains. This offers an explanation for the formation of the comet-like spots and the gradual loss of bioactivity of HHL, OHL OdDHL observed using <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> ATCC-BAA 2240 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) and confirmed in the luminescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) when using the reporter strains pSB401 and pSB1142.

Ultimately, the findings from the UHPLC-MS and the TLC overlays indicating the presence of a series of AHL by-products requires further work involving the purification and structural elucidation of the products.</p><p>Considering the potential use of cold plasmas, for example, in the topical treatment of wounds, the putative production of modified, active AHLs following short plasma exposures of native signalling molecules is of crucial importance, and requires further investigation both from a biological and clinical perspective.

This study for the first time offers insights into how plasma exposure can rapidly attenuate QS dependent virulence factor production as well as providing insights into the mechanistic interaction of atmospheric plasma and AHL molecules, leading to chemical modification and degradation of the parent molecules. Whilst further experimental analysis of the plasma treated AHLs is currently underway in order to gain a greater understanding and knowledge of these complex interaction, these data provide necessary and pertinent information for the application of cold plasma in clinical applications, where ultimately the complex interplay between plasma generated reactive species and biological molecules must be given appropriate consideration.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reporter strains and Growth conditions</title><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (ATCC BAA-47) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in LBB at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.
