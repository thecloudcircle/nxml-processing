Ghrelin administration promotes an anti-fibrotic response in a surgical mouse model of adhesion-induction, but the mechanisms mediating this effect have not been established. In the current study, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the anti-adhesion effect of ghrelin were investigated. Post-surgical adhesions were experimentally created in C57BL/6 wild-type mice via a combination of ischemic peritoneal buttons and cecal multiple abrasions. Ghrelin or saline intraperitoneal injections were given twice daily from two days before surgery to selected time points post-surgically to assess the phenotypic and molecular effects of treatment (1 day (n = 20), 4 days (n = 20) and 20 days (n = 40) after surgery). Endpoints included the scoring of adhesions and gene and protein expression analysis of pro-fibrogenic factors conducted on peritoneal ischemic tissue by quantitative PCR and Western blot. Ghrelin administration significantly reduced post-surgical adhesions and down-regulated pro-inflammatory gene and protein expression, including Tgfb3 and Tgfbr2. The up-regulation of inhibitory proteins Smad6 and Smad7 confirmed the ghrelin-induced blockage of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. Ghrelin is a candidate therapeutic drug for post-operative adhesion prevention, inhibiting inflammatory responses via blockage of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway at the onset of surgery before the occurrence of the granulation-remodeling phase.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The American Society for Reproductive Medicine</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Lifespan Hospital System Research Funds</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and Lifespan Hospital System Research Funds.

Several pathways are involved in adhesiogenesis, many of which are also involved in normal wound healing [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite the diverse strategies developed to minimize and prevent post-operative adhesions in pelvic and abdominal surgery, adhesions remain a frequent complication [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of post-operative adhesion formation is similar after almost all types of surgery. Surgical trauma evokes an inflammatory response, promoting pro-coagulatory and anti-fibrinolytic reactions causing an increase in fibrin formation. Peritoneal inflammation is a crucial factor in determining the degree of imbalance between fibrin formation and degradation that causes adhesion formation [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pathogenesis of post-operative adhesions is characterized by two prominent steps: the initial inflammatory response, in which immune cells and cytokines play crucial roles, and the granulation-remodeling phase [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Various signals and molecular mediators are involved in post-surgical adhesion formation. Peritoneal surgical injury initiates inflammation with fibrinous exudate and fibrin formation activated from the coagulation cascade pathway [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After surgery, the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis is in favor of the coagulation system, creating a fibrin matrix. During the granulation phase, fibroblasts migrate into this fibrin matrix and differentiate into myofibroblasts causing deposition of extracellular matrix components (ECM). At this point the extracellular matrix can be completely dissolved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to normal wound healing or if this process is prevented by inhibitors of MMPs, peritoneal adhesions may occur [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), which is activated at the site of peritoneal injury, play an important role in regulating coagulation as well as fibrin formation, influencing the development of adhesions [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads signal transduction pathway acts as an important bridge between the inflammatory response and fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; stimulates fibroblast cell activation and extracellular matrix synthesis through its interaction with TGF-&#x003b2; receptors and activation of Smad2/3. Activation of Smad2/3 via phosphorylation induces their association with Smad4 and subsequent translocation into the nuclei, where these factors control the transcription of TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;responsive genes [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recruitment of inflammatory cells and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators contribute to the progression of fibrosis. When TGF-&#x003b2; is produced by infiltrating immune, inflammatory and mesenchymal cells, it signals transcriptional activation of pro-fibrotic genes, via the TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads signaling pathway or through alternative pathways such as the p38 MAPK signaling and RAS/ERK MAPK signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153968.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The concentrations of INF-&#x003b3; and Il17 in the supernatant fluid are maximal at 6&#x02013;12 hours after surgery, whereas TGF-&#x003b2;1 exhibits two-post-operative peaks of secretion at 2 hours and 3&#x02013;4 days [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Ghrelin circulates in two forms, ghrelin (acylated) and desacyl ghrelin [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Acylated ghrelin has been shown to be able to bind and activate GHSR1a due to octanoylation mediated by ghrelin O-acyltransferase [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Desacyl ghrelin, lacking of the post-translational modification of acylation for GHSR binding, has shown to have an effect on the cardiovascular system and metabolism of glucose and lipids [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies from our group showed that intraperitoneal administration of exogenous acylated ghrelin minimizes post-operative intra-abdominal adhesion formation, but the mechanism by which ghrelin impacts adhesions was not investigated [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A new surgical mouse model of induction of adhesions in C57BL/6 mice that is easily reproducible and effective at producing consistent adhesions for analysis was developed and characterized. This model, which showed consistency in intra-abdominal adhesion formation between cecum and peritoneal ischemic buttons, provides an excellent approach to define the ability of acylated ghrelin to prevent adhesion formation in a GHSR1a receptor-dependent manner. The involvement of GHSR1a receptor in the ghrelin-induced anti-adhesion effect was supported by using GHSR-null mice [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The present study evaluates the molecular mechanisms by which ghrelin impacts wound healing and peritoneal adhesions by analyzing the expression of pro-fibrogenic factors at the mRNA and protein levels at various post-operative time-points. This study indicates that the inhibition of post-operative adhesions by intraperitoneal injections of ghrelin is mediated via blockage of TGF-&#x003b2; pathway at the onset of surgery before the occurrence of the granulation-remodeling phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 80) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).

This new surgical model showed that ghrelin administered intraperitoneally prevents post-operative adhesion formation in a GHSR-1a receptor-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the present study, this surgical model was employed to define altered molecular events regulating post-operative adhesion formation after intraperitoneal administration of ghrelin. The genesis of adhesion formation is due to a trauma/injury that results in the initiation of an inflammatory response leading to the formation of a fibrin matrix [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During normal peritoneal healing, the fibrin bands are broken down by fibrinolysis into fibrin degradation products; alternatively, during abnormal healing, ischemia results in a reduction of fibrinolytic activity leading to adhesion formation [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Previous findings elucidated the importance of the peritoneal fibrinolytic system in the regulation of adhesion formation. Down-regulation of fibrinolytic activity results in increased adhesions, while up-regulation results in a reduction of adhesions [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Plat mRNA expression was significantly reduced in ghrelin-treated samples at 1 day, resulting in a down-regulation of the fibrinolytic activity. Thus, the mechanism by which ghrelin decreases adhesion formation is not associated with the activation of the fibrinolytic pathway. Additionally, significant upregulation of the matrix metalloproteinases mRNA levels in ghrelin-treated samples compared to the controls was not detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153968.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Since alterations in fibrinolysis did not explain the ghrelin-induced amelioration of adhesions, the role of inflammation was investigated by measuring the mRNA expression levels of several interleukins and cytokines that are implicated in the initial phase of the inflammatory process. The ability of ghrelin in alleviating post-operative adhesiogenesis may be associated with effects on these initiators of inflammation and a resulting down-regulation of Tgfb3 mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153968.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Expression of all three TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms increase after peritoneal injury at different times. TGF-&#x003b2;3 protein levels were minimally expressed after surgery increasing with the formation of adhesions. Exogenous addition of TGF-&#x003b2;3 at the time of surgery significantly increased adhesion formation in the mouse [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Our findings showed that TGFbr2 mRNA and protein levels were also decreased in ghrelin-treated peritoneal ischemic tissue compared to the controls. This ghrelin-induced decreased expression of TGF-&#x003b2;R2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 may attenuate TGF-&#x003b2;R1 pathway activation, resulting in the inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; activity. Canonical and non-canonical TGF-&#x003b2; pathways are involved in the activation of myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;R2 is required for intracellular signal transduction through the formation of a heterotetrameric complex with TGF&#x003b2;-R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153968.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The TGF&#x003b2;-R2 receptor is a constitutively active kinase whereas the TGF-&#x003b2;R1 needs to be activated by the TGF&#x003b2;-R2. After ligand-induced formation of the heteromeric complex, TGF&#x003b2;-R2 phosphorylates TGF-&#x003b2;R1 at glycine and serine/threonine residues. This phosphorylation event changes the conformation of the TGF-&#x003b2;R1 receptor, thereby activating its kinase. The activated TGF-&#x003b2;R1 receptor propagates the intracellular signal by phosphorylating specific proteins (SMADs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153968.g006">Fig 6</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Studies in both humans and animal models are supportive of these findings, in which the overproduction of TGF-&#x003b2; was correlated with pathological tissue fibrosis and adhesion formation [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; activity reduces adhesion formation [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153968.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The ghrelin-induced blockage of TGF-&#x003b2; activity was also confirmed by up-regulation of Smad7 at 4 days post-surgery in our surgical mouse model. Smad7 is an inhibitor of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by preventing Smad3 and/or Smad2 phosphorylation and recruitment of Smad2/Smad3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153968.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

Ghrelin-induced up-regulation of Smad3 gene expression at 4 days post-surgery may be a compensatory effect generated by the inhibitory effect of Smad6 and Smad7 on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. To examine the TGF-&#x003b2; downstream signaling molecules mediating the effect of ghrelin, western blot analysis was conducted to quantify the phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 protein levels on the total levels of SMAD2 and SMAD3 at 4 days post-surgery. In comparison to the control samples, ghrelin-treated samples were suggestive of an attenuation of phospho-SMAD3 protein levels relative to the total SMAD3 proteins levels at 4 days post-surgery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153968.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; may also work through an alternative non-Smad signaling pathway to convey the same invasive fibrinogenic signals [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and TGF-&#x003b2; associated kinase I (TAK1) are crucial for the activation of MAPK signaling [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The current study revealed that ghrelin administration significantly decreases Tnf, Mapk14 (p38&#x003b1;) and Myc mRNA levels and increases Smad6 mRNA levels. These results suggest that the ghrelin anti-adhesion effect is also mediated by down-regulation of p38-MAPK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153968.g006">Fig 6</xref>). c-Myc is a downstream target of p38&#x003b1; and it is known to be involved in inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. p38-MAPK signaling is a compensatory pathway that amplifies the response to TGF-&#x003b2; via a non-canonical pathway in case of reduced expression of TGF-&#x003b2; receptors [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

The inhibition of p38-MAPK results in a reduction of alpha-SMA expression which is a key factor involved in the differentiation of fibroblasts to a contractile myofibroblastic phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Il-4 mRNA expression was significantly decreased at 4 and 20 days post-surgery in ghrelin-treated peritoneal ischemic buttons compared to controls. IL-4-activated M2 macrophages are involved in the peritoneal fibrotic process with peritoneal M2 macrophages acting as potential targets for the interventional therapy of peritoneal fibrosis. The IL-4 cytokine promotes alternative activation of macrophages into the M2 phenotype and inhibits classical activation of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. An increase in M2 macrophages, also known as repair macrophages, is coupled with the secretion of TGF-&#x003b2;. The release of arginase, proline, polyaminases and TGF-&#x003b2; by the activated M2 cells is associated with peritoneal fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In addition, IL13RA2 mRNA was significantly decreased at 4 days post-surgery in ghrelin-treated peritoneal ischemic buttons compared to controls, suggesting that the anti-fibrogenic response of ghrelin is potentiated by down-regulation of IL13RA2 signaling upstream. IL-13 induces monocytes and macrophages to produce TGF-&#x003b2;1, a potent regulator of extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Fichtner-Feigl%20S%5BAuthor%5D&#x00026;cauthor=true&#x00026;cauthor_uid=16327802">Fichtner-Feigl S</ext-link> et al. 2006, suggested that Il13RA2 signaling is an important therapeutic target for the prevention of fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Adhesion formation is associated with an increase of local inflammatory mediators, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The present study shows that ghrelin significantly decreases Icam-1 mRNA levels in peritoneal ischemic tissue at 4 and 20 days post-surgery. The first step in adhesion formation is the initiation of a local inflammatory response at the site of injury via expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal cavity to facilitate leukocyte migration through the wall of the blood vessel [<xref rid="pone.0153968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, these experiments suggest that ghrelin inhibits the TGF-&#x003b2;/Smads and p-38 MAPK signaling pathways activated during the inflammatory response at the onset of injury before the granulation-remodeling phase occurs. We provide evidence that ghrelin reduces up-stream collagen deposition and myofibroblastic differentiation via down-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors, TGF&#x003b2;3, TGF&#x003b2;R2 and up-regulation of inhibitor proteins such as Smad7 and Smad6. Therefore, the attenuation of extracellular matrix component production and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts via inhibition of the inflammatory process at the onset of injury rather than up-regulation of fibrinolytic activity may be a viable therapeutic strategy for the prevention of post-surgical adhesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153968.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene expression of peritoneal ischemic tissues exposed to ghrelin for 1, 4 and 20 days.</title><p>Data are presented as fold change of ghrelin-treated samples on controls over the geometric mean of all the Housekeeping genes (Actb, B2m, Gapdh, Gusb and Hsp90ab1).
