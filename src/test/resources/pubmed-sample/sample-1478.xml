The RMS fluctuations in the height measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM) was 50.9 p.m., reflecting a large extent of homogeneity of the APTES layer (Fig.&#x000a0;2 in Ref.&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>).

Using N-hydroxysuccinimide(-NHS) activation to carboxylate followed by nucleophilic attack, we subsequently attached a mixture (1:10) of bi-functional (maleimide-polyethylene-glycol-NHS, mal-PEG-NHS) and mono-functional PEG-NHS to surface attached amines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>a).

SrtA present in <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic>, <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> catalyzes the transmembrane proteins containing enzyme-recognition motif, Leu-Pro-Xxx-Thr-Gly (LPXTG; Xxx is any amino acid), onto the cell-wall. The cysteinyl thiol group in SrtA nucleophilically attacks the threonine-glycine amide bond and forms a proteinyl-enzyme thioester intermediate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>a). Another nucleophilic attack by a terminal oligoglycine present on the cell-wall releases the enzyme thereby tethering the protein to the cell-wall <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The high propensity of the thioester towards nucleophile from the amine group of polyglycine (kinetically most preferred for tetraglycine), makes sortagging extremely specific <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Adopting such sortagging, we modified two cell-adhesion cadherin class of proteins, cadherin 23 (Cdh23) and protocadherin 15 (Pcdh15) with the five residues of SrtA recognition site at the C-terminus (See Materials and Method). The two outermost extracellular domains (EC1+2) of Cdh23 and Pcdh15 are known to mediate heterophilic trans-interactions at the tip-inks of hair-cells <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It is well established that the short peptide chain containing as low as only five amino acid residues does not interfere with any measurements and ought to be serving as a linker to accommodate the possible rotational degree of freedom. Polyglycines those are pre-attached to surface through maleimide-cysteine Michael addition serve as a nucleophile to attack the thioester and engrafts proteins covalently onto surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>a).</p><p>To confirm the covalent bond as the only mode of association between protein and surface, we incubated Cdh23 and Pcdh15 in polyglycine attached surfaces in absence and presence of SrtA. Immunohistochemistry against N-terminus 6xHis-tag of the protein led to a TIRF signal only for SrtA mediated attachments, thereby ensuring specific covalent attachment of Cdh23 and Pcdh15 onto the surface (Figs.&#x000a0;9 and 10 in Ref.&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>).</p><p>To screen the high-specificity of sortagging and effective inertness of the surface, we compared surfaces decorated by ESCORTing proteins (Cdh23 or Pcdh15) from whole cell-lysate and from chromatography-purified fractions. We carried out immunohistochemical imaging for both surfaces using TIRF with primary anti-His antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 labeled secondary antibody against N-terminal 6xHis-tag (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1b,</xref> c and d). We observed comparable density of fluorophores along with identical distance distributions between closest fluorescent spots for both cell-lysate and purified proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>e). To distinguish the specific fluorescent spots from nonspecific artifacts, we employed TEV protease to cut the N-terminal 6xHis-tag site <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and observed &#x0003e;99% reduction in fluorescent signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>f, g and 1h) in three hours. TEV protease cleaves 6xHis-tag present in a protein. So incubation with TEV protease leads to cutting of 6xHis-tag, as a result antibody bound to 6xHis-tag will also get detached from the protein which led to decrease of fluorescence signal with time and at the end entire disappearance of it from the ESCORTed coverslip. To check whether some unwanted non-target protein is sticking on the surface we labeled whole cell extract from other cell lines randomly with Cy3 NHS ester as well as Cy-maleimide and incubated on the surface. We observed no fluorescence signal in these cases entailing that no non-target protein is sticking on the surface (Fig.&#x000a0;6 in Ref.&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). No events on the same surface in SMFM, verified the specificity of the reaction as also the provable nature of surface to the contents of the cell extract (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>f).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Functional studies of the ESCORTed proteins employing single molecule fluorescence microscopy and SMFM</title><p>It is the fundamental requirement for a surface to maintain the functionality of the proteins after immobilization. It is well known that Cdh23 and Pcdh15 interacts with each other in trans conformation through their N-termini to build tip-link connecting two neighboring stereocilia in inner ear hair cells <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>
<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We probed the heterophilic interactions between these two proteins, Cdh23 and Pcdh15, to check the biocompatibility of the modified surfaces. To visualize such dimerization on surfaces, we carried out single-molecule pull-down of ligand-proteins (Cdh23 or Pcdh15) from whole cell-lysate. We first ESCORTed receptor-proteins (Cdh23 or Pcdh15) to surfaces. Ligand-proteins in cell-lysate were fused with single cy3 at their C-terminals by manifesting sortagging and allowed to interact with their receptors ESCORTed already on surfaces <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>a).

In control, no receptor protein was ESCORTed on the surface and surface was incubated only with labeled ligand protein. The absence of ESCORTed receptor-proteins on the surface did not attract ligands and showed no fluorescence signal in TIRF image (Fig.&#x000a0;12b in Ref.&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Pulling down of single protein-molecules directly from cell-lysate and performing force-spectroscopy on ESCORTed surfaces.

Here, we employed the same concept to monitor the specificity of the surface. After pull down of labeled ligand protein from cell lysate on the surface using interacting receptor protein present already on the surface we incubated the surface in 1&#x000a0;mM EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(&#x003b2;-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N&#x02032;,N&#x02032;-tetraacetic acid) for 1&#x000a0;h. EGTA chelates out the calcium ions bound to proteins and facilitates the Cdh23-Pcdh15 unbinding. After one hour we imaged the surface using TIRFM and observed no fluorescence signal suggesting that no non-specific proteins from cell lysate was adhered to the surface (Fig.&#x000a0;5 in Ref.&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). Corroborating to fluorescence results, SMFM also measured events as low as 0.4% for nonspecific incubation, nearly 10 times lower than specific and similar to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>f.</p><p>To check the extent and specificity of single molecule pull-down, we probed the unbinding force of protein-protein interactions at the single-molecule level using AFM. We ESCORTed purified Pcdh15 on the cantilever and Cdh23 to the glass-coverslip and subsequently quantified the strength of interaction at a constant pulling velocity of 5000 nms<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>c). Next, we repeated the experiments by ESCORTing Pcdh15 from cell-lysate on the cantilever and Cdh23 from cell-lysate on the coverslip and measured the unbinding forces at same pulling velocity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>d and e). We measured almost equal probability of single molecule interactions (5.3% and 5.4% respectively) between proteins both from cell lysate extract and purified proteins with similar force distribution (Inset of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>c and e). Only 2.7% of the total acceptable events showed multiple unbinding nature with proteins ESCORTed from cell-lysate and 3.2% for pure fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;14 in Ref.&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). Both these fractions are very well within the Poisson distribution limit for single molecule detection <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>To sum up, we have devised a protocol for effective surface passivation and ESCORTing of proteins that can be suitably deployed for single molecule studies. The exceedingly high passive nature of the surface and high specificity of the sortase reaction is appropriate for protein ESCORTing directly from cell-lysate, deploying the protocol substantial reduction in investment of time, energy and chemicals in purification. Sortase mediated reactions are strictly site-directed and hence, can be targeted for labeling any unstructured part in addition to C, N-terminals <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>
<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The availability of both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and independent variants of sortase make the labeling more pliable to buffer <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Since sortagging is also reported on DNA <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> our protocol can be extended to ESCORT DNA as also to any cellular-organelle onto surfaces directly from cell-lysate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Passivation and functionalization of coverslips and cantilevers for covalent attachment of proteins employing sortase a click chemistry</title><p>The glass coverslips and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> cantilevers were first cleaned in a plasma chamber at low air pressure (typically 200&#x02013;600 mtorr) and medium radio frequency radiation (&#x0223c;10&#x000a0;MH) for 1&#x000a0;min at ambient temperature.

Coverslips used in single molecule force mapping using AFM were etched in 1&#x000a0;M KOH (Himedia) for 15&#x000a0;min. For fluorescence imaging, this step can, however, be avoided.
