However, when an impact force is applied at the nanoscale, deformation-induced melting prevents observations of fcc metal amorphisation. Here we propose a sonication treatment of Ag nanowires (fcc) and confirmed amorphisation induced by high strain rates at bent areas of the Ag nanowires. Owing to the mismatch of the deformation modes between the core and the surface, we observed a diameter related increase of the ductility of Ag nanowires under deformation at ultra-high strain rates generated by sonication. The sonication-prepared amorphous Ag was stable at room temperature. Amorphous Ag at the bent areas was highly reactive and was readily recrystallized under light illumination or vulcanised. Our study verifies the occurrence of high strain rate induced amorphisation in pure fcc MGs and provides a powerful tool for mechanical studies on metal nanomaterials under extremely high strain rates and forces.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China (Nos.

Firstly, we experimentally confirmed amorphisation induced by the high strain rate at the bent areas in Ag nanowires by a sonication treatment. Secondly, we observed an exceptionally high ductility of the Ag nanowires during the sonication process. We found that the sonication-induced amorphisation of the Ag nanowires showed stability at room temperature. After a short period of illumination, we observed recrystallisation at the bent areas of the Ag nanowires. <italic>In situ</italic> chemical reactions also revealed a considerable increase of the chemical activity of the amorphous Ag on the Ag nanowire surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results Section</title><p id="Par7">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows the possible rupturing effects caused by the cavitation bubbles jets ejected towards the Ag nanowires in ethanol solution. The bubble jets exerted extreme forces on the nanowires. The ultrasonic strength exerted on the nanowires depended on the nanowire length, diameter, and the distances from the bubble jet. The flow rates of cavitation bubbles were directly proportional to the ultrasonic forces exerted on the nanowires. After a 2-min sonication treatment, bending deformation and breakage occurred at most of the Ag nanowires. For the bent Ag nanowires, the outer layers of the bent areas of the Ag nanowires were subjected to tensile stress and became elongated along the &#x0003c;110&#x0003e; crystal direction, due to the typical bending deformation of Ag nanowires, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. The outer layers of the bent areas showed the fastest deformation rates and maximum stress; hence, the amorphisation was observed particularly at the outer layers of the bent areas. The ultrasonic forces decreased rapidly as the distance from the bubbles increased, which indicated that the highest strain rate deformation of the nanowires should occur in close proximity to the bubbles. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the impaction on nanowires with a length 40 &#x003bc;m, and a diameter of 60&#x02009;nm reached up to 13&#x02009;GPa. Even at a diameter of 350&#x02009;nm, the pressure reached almost 0.4&#x02009;GPa at a distance 5 &#x003bc;m away from the bubble jet. Detailed deduction can be found in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and has been provided in the supporting information. Depending on the maximum flow rates surrounding the bubble<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, the ultrasonic-induced strain rate of the nanowires reached up to 10<sup>9</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>11</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Therefore, sonication treatments of Ag nanowires provide an excellent platform for studying high strain rate deformation at the nanoscale.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Illustration of Ag nanowire deformation under ultra-high strain rate induced by sonication.

The strain rates generated by sonication (10<sup>9</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>11</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) should be enough to induce Ag amorphisation.

However, careful calculation indicated that the heat generation will not accumulate in the defect, and the observed change was mainly induced by the ultra-high strain generated by sonication. Taking advantage of the ultra-short thermal diffusion distance of the metal at the nanoscale, the nature of thermal diffusion in Ag nanowires was limited to efficiently avoid heat accumulation.

Assuming that the deformation heat generation occurs at the centre of the Ag nanowire (diameter 60&#x02009;nm), the characteristic time is only 2.27&#x02009;ps. The characteristic time of the thermal diffusivity is much greater than that of the strain rate, and this difference enables heat dissipation and avoids localised melting. Apparently, the enthalpy of fusion was overcome by the high strain rates induced by sonication rather than Boltzmann thermal energy. This effect led to the formation of amorphous Ag on the Ag nanowire surface. The strain rates decreased rapidly away from the centre of the bent areas of the Ag nanowires. As a result, the distortion feature away from the centre of the bent areas shows a typical crystal deformation mode.</p><p id="Par11">The diameter related bending deformations and section shrinkages under extremely high stresses could be attributed to momentum-induced non-uniform amorphisation of the Ag nanowires, which resulted in an amorphous surface and a crystal core, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref>. The distances of the accumulative dislocation release from the neutral axis to the top surface of Ag nanowires were much shorter in Ag nanowires with small diameters. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, for Ag nanowire with diameter 60&#x02009;nm, the dislocations release distance is about 40&#x02009;nm, which is quite short distance. The short distances enabled adequate release of the dislocations on the surface of the Ag nanowires to form amorphous surfaces before serious strain concentration and a great increase of their yield strain. This inadequate dislocation release generated micro-cracks in the Ag nanowires with larger diameters under high strain rate deformation. As previously reported, homogeneous deformation can exhibit plastic flow without work hardening or necking under deformation at a high strain rate at the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which has considerably different deformation modes to those of the crystal core. Apparently, the mismatch in the regions of different deformation modes increased as the diameters of the Ag nanowire increased, leading to surface cracking of the Ag nanowires. As a result, Ag nanowires with smaller diameters exhibited higher ductility at high strengths and strain rates.</p><p id="Par12">The pure fcc MGs were thought to be unstable even at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, which led to the failed preparations by ultra-fast quenching methods.

Total crystallisation occurred at the bent area of the Ag nanowire surfaces even after a short period of weak light illumination (infrared lamp 10&#x02009;W/cm<sup>2</sup> for 5&#x02009;min), as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Stability of Ag nanowires in physical and chemical conditions.

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, the black areas indicated by the yellow dot, covered the bent areas of Ag nanowire and grew bigger as the reaction was increased. Owing to the strong light absorption of silver sulfide in the visible spectrum, the vulcanisation (sulfur 0.01&#x02009;wt%) rate of the Ag nanowires (black area growth) reflects the chemical activity of the Ag nanowires. As a result, Ag crystals with severe lattice defects surrounding the bent area exhibited higher chemical activity than that of the original Ag crystal. This phenomenon could provide a route to the design of metal catalysts at the nanoscale.</p><p id="Par14">In summary, we report sonication induced amorphisation in Ag nanowires. The formation of amorphous Ag at the bent areas of Ag nanowires was confirmed from TEM diffraction patterns. Momentum-induced inhomogeneous amorphisation of the Ag nanowires led to diameter related bending deformation and section shrinkage of the Ag nanowires. The sonication-prepared amorphous Ag showed stability at room temperature. Furthermore, enhanced chemical activity was identified at the bent area and related to the formation of defects and electronic imbalance in the crystal lattice surrounding the bent area. This work opens a completely new approach to studying the mechanical properties of metal nanostructures under extreme deformation conditions.
