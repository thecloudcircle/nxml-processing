The past five years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of completely sequenced chloroplast genomes with the application of second-generation sequencing technology in plastid genome sequencing projects.

Both of them failed to obtain properly defined cpDNA bands. However, we developed a simple but efficient method based on sucrose gradients and found that the modified protocol worked efficiently to isolate the cpDNA from the same three plant species. We sequenced the isolated DNA samples with Illumina (Solexa) sequencing technology to test cpDNA purity according to aligning sequence reads to the reference chloroplast genomes, showing that the reference genome was properly covered.

To date, at least 200 plant complete cpDNAs have been sequenced (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=2759&#x00026;opt=plastid">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=2759&#x00026;opt=plastid</ext-link>), and in the recent years, the number is rapidly increasing due to an extensive application of the second-generation sequencing technologies to the whole chloroplast genome sequencing. Despite its short sequence reads, excess sequence data produced by the second-generation sequencing technologies are fairly suitable for the genome assembly, because the chloroplast genome is much smaller in size and simple in structural complexity compared to nuclear genomes <xref rid="pone.0031468-Shaffer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For example, a single 600 Gbp per run in the Illumina HiSeq-2000 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illumina.com">http://www.illumina.com</ext-link>) could conceivably sequence &#x0223c;40,000 average-sized chloroplast genomes to a depth of 120&#x000d7;. Next-generation sequencing technologies have undoubtedly made it possible to sequence the entire plant genomes more efficiently and economically than ever before with decreased time and costs compared with traditional approaches <xref rid="pone.0031468-Moore3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. With rapid progress in sequencing technologies, the acquisition of high quality cpDNAs from plant tissues for the whole genome sequencing is urgently needed.</p><p>Two experimental methods are often employed to collect cpDNAs in plants. The first is the whole chloroplast genome amplification from total DNA using long polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the second is direct isolation of cpDNAs from fresh plant materials based on sucrose gradient. The former method is PCR-based cpDNA sequencing, which is usually used to the situation that substantial plant leaf materials (e.g., &#x0223c;20 to 100 g fresh leaves) are unavailable but can be substituted by extracting total DNA from limited materials. The cpDNA fragments are further amplified by using the conservative primer pairs <xref rid="pone.0031468-Heinze1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The latter focuses on isolating the chloroplasts from fresh plant leaves according to sucrose gradient centrifugation, followed by a direct extraction of cpDNAs from intact chloroplasts <xref rid="pone.0031468-Jansen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Of them, sucrose gradient centrifugation is limited by the availability of ultracentrifuges which are not facilitated in many laboratories <xref rid="pone.0031468-Diekmann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As a result, the PCR method is the most extensively used among the chloroplasts sequencing projects regardless of its time-consumption and higher costs <xref rid="pone.0031468-Cronn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As an alternative of the sucrose gradient centrifugation process, DNAse I treatment <xref rid="pone.0031468-Kolodner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and high salt precipitation <xref rid="pone.0031468-Bookjans1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> have succeeded in isolating cpDNAs of some specific plant species, but further applications to additional species have been restricted, as both of them were not easy to make a balance between enough yield and quality with limited contamination of nuclear and mitochondria DNA <xref rid="pone.0031468-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The rapid progress in the next-generation technologies requires developing new methods to isolate cpDNAs with increased quality and yield, especially aiming to simplify the isolation process so as to meet the need for the whole chloroplast genome sequencing. We modified the above-described methods <xref rid="pone.0031468-Jansen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031468-Kolodner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031468-Bookjans1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> to develop a new protocol and further applied it to isolate cpDNAs from the three species, <italic>Oryza brachyantha</italic>, <italic>Leersia japonica</italic> and <italic>Prinsepia utihis</italic>. To test their purities, these three isolated cpDNAs were subsequently sequenced by using the Illumina (Solexa) sequencing-by-synthesis technology.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The isolation of cpDNA</title><p>The cpDNA isolation includes the three basic steps: separation of plastids from leaf tissues, lysis of the chloroplasts, and purification of DNA. Because the isolation of intact chloroplasts often acts as a critical stage of the whole procedure, the method based on sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation is the most commonly employed to effectively separate nuclear DNAs from cpDNAs. Using two grass species (<italic>O. brachyantha</italic> and <italic>L. japonica</italic>) and one rosid plant (<italic>P. utihis</italic>), we first performed cpDNA isolation by following the previously described procedure <xref rid="pone.0031468-Jansen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Electrophoresis of the resulting DNA displayed a very weak band on agarose gel, indicative of very low cpDNA yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031468-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This study only used 20 g fresh leaves, while more than 100 g of leaf tissues were recommended <xref rid="pone.0031468-Jansen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Another possible explanation was that, after the sucrose gradient centrifugation, only a small amount of chloroplast pellet was collected, leading to the extraction of few cpDNAs. Because the library preparation for the whole genome sequencing needs a substantial amount of starting DNA, either repeated cpDNA isolation or substantial leaves are required to use this method. Considering the amount of time-consumed by sucrose gradient preparations, two alternative methods, DNAse I treatment and high salt method, may be suitable to replace the sucrose gradient centrifugation method.</p><fig id="pone-0031468-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0031468.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of cpDNA isolation from the three plant species among different extraction methods.</title><p>Three methods, including A) modified protocol, B) DNAse I treatment and C) sucrose gradient centrifugation, were separately employed to isolate cpDNAs from a) <italic>O. brachyantha</italic>, b) <italic>L. japonica</italic>, and c) <italic>P. utihis</italic>. For each plant species, 20 g fresh leaves were used. The DNA bands were shown on a 0.8&#x00025; agarose gel. M indicates 1 kbp DNA ladder.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0031468.g001"/></fig><p>The DNAse I treatment method used DNAse I to digest nuclear DNA that adheres to the outer chloroplast membrane. The success in isolating the cpDNAs was reported from two of many species which they have attempted <xref rid="pone.0031468-Jansen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. When the three plant species were used in this study, however, we failed to isolate intact cpDNAs since they all were degraded by the DNAse I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031468-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The result is consistent with the fact that DNAse I digest not only the nuclear DNA but also the cpDNA which might not be well protected within intact plastids <xref rid="pone.0031468-Jansen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031468-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The second alternative method employs a high NaCl concentration in the isolation buffers, which do not involve any sucrose gradient centrifugation. This method was only reported to have succeeded in isolating the pea cpDNA <xref rid="pone.0031468-Bookjans1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Considering that only increasing the NaCl concentration may not be enough to enhance cpDNA purity, we made several modifications of the method to broaden its application to as many taxa as possible. The final protocol (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">materials and methods</xref>) demonstrated the advantage of isolating sufficient cpDNAs with leaf materials of the same three plant species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031468-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>As a modification of the sucrose gradient centrifugation, the high salt method significantly simplified the cpDNA isolation process. By using this method, our first effort to isolate the cpDNAs also seems successful, as it can get a relatively clearly defined DNA band. When we increased the amount of fresh leaves, however, a positive correlation between increased DNA yield and the possibility of DNA degradation was found, indicating that there is more contamination of nuclear DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031468-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The observation suggests that this method may not be suitable to isolate cpDNAs with high purity. As an alternative approach in chloroplast isolation, four to six volumes (v/w) cold isolation buffer (in the original protocol) may not be enough to homogenate the fresh leaves (e.g., 20 g fresh leaves with 100 ml isolation buffer). Therefore, we increased the amount of isolation buffer from 5 to 20 volumes of fresh leaves (e.g., 20 g fresh leaves with 400 ml buffer A in our protocol) in the subsequent experiment. Even when 50 g fresh leaves were used, a well-defined cpDNA band can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031468-g002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that the modification led to a successful isolation of the cpDNAs. It is likely that about 20 g leaves may be more optimal as it could include less contaminating nuclear DNA. Furthermore, two additional centrifugation steps (200 g 20 min and 3500 g 20 min, separately) were used to discard the cell debris and collect chloroplast pellet. To decrease the nuclear DNA contamination that adheres to the outer chloroplast membrane, we also incorporated extra steps to wash the chloroplast pellet with buffer B, further increasing the purity of isolated cpDNAs. Last but not least, chloroplasts were lysed using SDS and Proteinase K instead of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The final isolated cpDNAs were digested with <italic>Hind</italic>III and the result was visualized on a 0.8&#x00025; agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031468-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Among these modifications, incorporated gradual centrifugation steps were of the most importance, because they are able to increase the cpDNA purity by separating the chloroplasts from cell debris. If larger amounts of starting materials (e.g., 50 g fresh leaves) were used, it is necessary to add a second centrifugation step at 200 g.</p><fig id="pone-0031468-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0031468.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Comparison of cpDNA isolation with high salt method and the modified high salt method for the three plant species.</title><p>cpDNAs were isolated from 10 g, 20 g, and 50 g fresh leaves of the three plant species: a) <italic>O. brachyantha</italic>, b) <italic>L. japonica</italic>, and c) <italic>P. utihis</italic>.

By means of the next-generation Illumina sequencing technology, the three isolated cpDNA samples were subsequently sequenced and their purity reached &#x0223c;40&#x02013;50&#x00025;, which were sufficiently pure to further perform the genome assembly. In addition, we tested the genome coverages influenced by the sequence data, showing that only &#x0223c;50 Mbp could attain at least 100&#x000d7; average coverage of the chloroplast genome when the cpDNA purity reached &#x0223c;40&#x02013;50&#x00025;. In all, this modified method is able to serve as an efficient cpDNA extract procedure to complete the chloroplast genome sequencing of angiosperms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Plant materials</title><p>The <italic>O. brachyantha</italic> and <italic>L. japonica</italic> (Poaceae) plants were grown in the greenhouse, while <italic>P. utihis</italic> (Rosaceae) was transplanted in Botanical Garden of Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
