Introduction</title><p>Rabies is a fatal neurological disorder in humans and other mammalian species which is caused by rabies virus (RABV), the prototype member of the genus <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> within the family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> [<xref rid="B1-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> genus currently contains 14 classified and one proposed species which are classified into distinct phylogenetic groups [<xref rid="B2-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Group 1 consists of RABV, Khujand virus (KHUV), Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1), European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2), Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV), Aravan virus (ARAV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), and Irkut virus (IRKV). Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV), Lagos bat virus (LBV), as well as Mokola virus (MOKV) represent group 2, while West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) represents group 3 [<xref rid="B5-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For Ikoma and Lleida bat lyssaviruses (IKOV and LLEBV, respectively) the establishment of a novel group 4 has been proposed [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The prototype RABV has a worldwide distribution and is found primarily in carnivores (e.g., dogs, foxes, raccoons, skunks, wolves, etc.) and North American (but not European) bats. Except MOKV, which has been found in shrews and cats, all other lyssaviruses have their natural reservoir in bats. By far, most human cases of rabies are caused by RABV, but sporadic infection with other <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> species has been reported to cause the disease as well [<xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>RABV is usually transmitted to humans through saliva following a bite from an infected animal. The virus migrates to the central nervous system (CNS) via axonal retrograde transport and trans-synaptic transmission. Depending on the site of inoculation and the viral load in the inoculum this can take several weeks during which symptoms are not apparent. Usually, anti-RABV antibodies cannot be detected during this incubation period, thus impeding early serological diagnosis. Once the virus has reached the CNS, the outcome of the infection is almost always fatal [<xref rid="B13-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Inactivated rabies vaccines have been approved for immunoprophylaxis of animals as well as humans who are at risk of exposure to RABV (e.g., veterinarians, laboratory workers). The vaccine provides protection by inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies directed to the single viral envelope glycoprotein G [<xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thanks to the obligatory vaccination of pet dogs and cats and campaigns for vaccination of wildlife, some European countries are now declared rabies-free. The RABV vaccine protects against infection with members of phylogroup 1, but not of phylogroup 2 [<xref rid="B15-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>A post-exposure prophylaxis is available as well and includes administration of immunoglobulins from vaccinated humans or horses and accompanying active immunization with the inactivated RABV vaccine. This therapy is effective in preventing rabies disease only if given immediately after exposure to the virus. About 15 million people receive this post-exposure treatment every year following potential exposure to RABV. Despite being preventable by pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, RABV still causes about 50,000 human deaths per year, mostly in India, China, and African countries [<xref rid="B16-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is mainly due to the low availability and accessibility of vaccines and immunoglobulin therapy in these countries, but also because RABV is not effectively controlled in stray dogs [<xref rid="B17-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In order to assess the quality of immunoglobulin preparations, as well as the immune status of vaccinated animals and humans, a RABV neutralization test is usually performed. The fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test and the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) are the currently approved methods for the quantification of neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both require handling of live virus, making use of appropriate biosafety containment as well as vaccination of laboratory personnel necessary [<xref rid="B20-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, an alternative virus neutralization assay has been developed which is based on lentiviral pseudotypes [<xref rid="B21-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), like RABV, is a member of the family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, but has been classified into the genus <italic>Vesiculovirus</italic>. In the present work, a glycoprotein-G-deficient VSV expressing two different reporter genes was pseudotyped with lyssavirus envelope proteins using stably transfected helper cell lines. The VSV pseudotype particles and reporter gene expression were employed for virus neutralization tests using immune sera from vaccinated animals, World Health Organization (WHO) reference serum, and neutralizing antibodies. Specificity, sensitivity, and time requirements of this new pseudotype neutralization test were determined and compared with those of a commonly used RFFIT test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-08-00254"><title>2.

The ectodomains of the glycoproteins (amino acids 1&#x02013;439 for CVS-11 G and 1&#x02013;448 for MOKV G) were genetically fused to the GCN4_pII trimerization domain and inserted into the fourth transcription unit of the pVSV*&#x00394;G(HA) plasmid [<xref rid="B27-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] resulting in pVSV*&#x00394;G(secMOKV-G) and pVSV*&#x00394;G(secCVS-G).

After four more weeks, the animals were boosted a second time by intramuscular injection of 20 &#x000b5;g of pCAGGS plasmid DNA encoding the G proteins of CVS-11 and MOKV, respectively. The DNA was formulated with 20 &#x000b5;L of Lipofectamine&#x000ae; 2000 (Life Technologies). The animals were euthanized and bled four weeks after the final immunization. These animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Swiss animal protection law and approved by the animal welfare committee of the canton of Bern (authorization number BE119/13).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-08-00254"><title>2.4.

The expression of the viral envelope glycoproteins by the selected cell clones was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). All G proteins could be detected only if the cells had been treated before with doxycycline. The antibodies reacted with intact, non-permeabilized cells indicating that the G proteins were expressed at the cell surface. Western blot analysis revealed that the G proteins had the expected molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). Using this approach, very little expression of G proteins was observed in non-induced cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-08-00254"><title>3.2. Generation of VSV Pseudotypes</title><p>For pseudotyping of VSV with rhabdoviral glycoproteins, either recombinant VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) expressing the two reporter genes GFP and FLuc [<xref rid="B28-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or VSV*&#x02206;G(sNLuc) expressing GFP and secreted sNLuc was used. In order to assess the efficacy of pseudotype particle production, the T-Rex&#x02122;-CHO(SAD-G) helper cell line was infected with VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) using a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.05 infectious particles per cell. Aliquots of cell culture supernatants were collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h post infection (p.i.) and infectious titers determined on Vero cells. Doxycycline-treated T-Rex&#x02122;-CHO(SAD-G) cells produced maximum titers of about 10<sup>8</sup> fluorescent focus-forming units/mL (f.f.u./mL) at 48 h p.i., whereas only low amounts of virus (&#x0003c;10<sup>2</sup> f.f.u./mL) were released in the absence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). To determine the yield of pseudotype virus on different helper cell lines, the cells were infected with VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) or VSV*&#x02206;G(sNLuc) using an m.o.i. of 0.05. Cell culture supernatants were collected at 36 h p.i. and infectious virus titers determined on Vero cells. As expected, the highest virus yield (&#x0003e;10<sup>8</sup> f.f.u./mL) was obtained with T-Rex&#x02122;-CHO(VSV-G) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). The pseudotype virus titers achieved on helper cell lines expressing lyssavirus G proteins ranged from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> f.f.u./mL. However, T-Rex&#x02122;-CHO(CVS11-G) cells produced significantly lower pseudotype virus titers (about 10<sup>6</sup> f.f.u./mL). This might be attributed to the pronounced neurotropism of CVS-11 and possibly lower expression levels of appropriate receptors in CHO cells. On all helper cell lines, infectious titers of VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) and VSV*&#x02206;G(sNLuc) did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Of note, significant levels of infectious pseudotype virus were only produced in the presence of doxycycline, indicating that the viruses were not able to propagate in the absence of G protein. Accordingly, non-helper cells (e.g., Vero cells) did not release any progeny virus following infection with any of the pseudotype viruses (data not shown).</p><p>Infectious pseudotype virus titers were determined on Vero cells taking advantage of GFP reporter protein expression. To elucidate how virus dose would correlate with luciferase reporter expression, Vero cells were infected with SAD G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) and VSV*&#x02206;G(sNLuc) using different m.o.i. As expected, the luminescence signals recorded 6 h p.i. were proportionally correlated with the virus dose used, i.e., a 10-fold higher m.o.i. resulted in an approximately 10-fold higher luminescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). The secreted Nano luciferase activity produced higher signals than the firefly luciferase, suggesting that this enzyme represents a more sensitive reporter. To find out which infection time is minimally required to obtain a significantly high luciferase signal, Vero cells were infected with SAD G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) and VSV*&#x02206;G(sNLuc) using an m.o.i. of 0.01. Luminescence could be detected at significantly high levels as early as 6 h p.i. The sNLuc reporter always produced significantly higher signals than FLuc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>d).</p><p>In order to correlate the number of infectious pseudotype particles with luciferase reporter activity, Vero cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates were infected with VSV*&#x02206;G(sNLuc) using an m.o.i. ranging from 0.0001 to 0.001 infectious particles per cell. At 20 h p.i., the number of GFP-expressing cells was determined for 95 individual wells and correlated with the luciferase activity in the corresponding cell culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>e). The mean luciferase activity per GFP-positive cell was calculated to be 572 &#x000b1; 334 relative light units (RLU)/cell.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-08-00254"><title>3.3. Neutralization of Pseudotype Virus</title><p>In order to see whether CVS-11 G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(Luc) would be sensitive to neutralization by immune sera directed to the RABV G protein, the virus (100 f.f.u.) was incubated for 60 min with either human anti-RABV serum, rabbit anti-VSV serum, or no serum at all. Subsequently, the pseudotype virus-serum mixtures were incubated with T-Rex&#x02122;-CHO(VSV-G) or T-Rex&#x02122;-CHO(SAD-G) helper cells, either in the presence or absence of doxycycline. At 18 h p.i., GFP expression was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). In non-induced helper cells, GFP expression was restricted to single cells whereas in doxycycline-induced cells, virus was able to propagate, which led to an increased number of GFP-positive cells, thereby facilitating the detection of non-neutralized virus. Anti-RABV serum (1:80) completely neutralized CVS-11 G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) but had no effect if the virus had been <italic>trans</italic>-complemented with VSV G protein. Vice versa, anti-VSV immune serum (1:100) efficiently neutralized VSV G protein-pseudotyped but not CVS-11 G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc), indicating that the <italic>trans</italic>-complementing envelope glycoprotein specifically determined the susceptibility of the virus to antibody-mediated neutralization.</p><p>To determine the neutralization dose 50% (ND<sub>50</sub>) of the WHO reference serum with the PVN test, 100 f.f.u. of CVS-11 G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(sNLuc) were incubated with serial two-fold dilutions of reference serum and then inoculated with Vero cells. GFP reporter expression was monitored 8 h p.i., and wells completely devoid of GFP-positive cells were regarded as protected. The test was run in four parallels and ND<sub>50</sub> values calculated according to the Spearman&#x02013;K&#x000e4;rber method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). The PVN test was also performed using the sNLuc reporter and a luminescence cutoff value of 200 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>e). If higher sNLuc activity was detected in the culture medium, the cells in this well were regarded as infected and the virus considered as not neutralized. Using this luminescence cutoff value, a mean ND<sub>50</sub> value of 133 was calculated which corresponded well with the ND<sub>50</sub> value of 134 which was obtained with the GFP read-out of the PVN test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). However, the serum dilution causing 50% inhibition of sNLuc reporter expression was calculated to be 1/500 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>c), suggesting that this read-out may offer a more sensitive way to detect neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>In order to compare the PVN test with a commonly used RABV neutralization test, the assay was run with immune sera collected from mice that had been immunized with decreasing doses of RABV vaccine. The ND<sub>50</sub> values of these sera were calculated and compared with the ND<sub>50</sub> values determined by the modified RFFIT [<xref rid="B29-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. With both methods, the antibody responses of the immunized mice were found to depend on the vaccine dose with the highest ND<sub>50</sub> values associated with the 1/10 vaccine group and the lowest with the 1/250 vaccine group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f004">Figure 4</xref>). No significant differences were observed between the mean ND<sub>50</sub> values calculated with either of the two methods.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-08-00254"><title>3.4. Analysis of Pseudotype Viruses Bearing Other Lyssavirus Glycoproteins</title><p>Although infection with RABV is the most common cause of rabies disease, infection with other lyssaviruses has been associated with human fatalities as well [<xref rid="B33-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the PVN test was adapted to allow the detection of neutralizing antibodies directed to EBLV-1 and EBLV-2, which belong to phylogroup 1, and MOKV, which belongs to phylogroup 2. In addition, we compared CVS-11 G protein-pseudotyped with SAD G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(FLuc) in order to see whether the antigenic properties of these G proteins differ. The neutralization of all these pseudotype viruses was tested with WHO reference serum (2 IU/mL), mAb 16DB4 (raised against the SAD vaccine strain), rabbit anti-CVS-11 G protein, and rabbit anti-MOKV G protein using the GFP reporter for detection of infected cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-08-00254-t001">Table 1</xref>). The WHO reference serum and mAb 16DB4 neutralized CVS-11 G protein- and SAD G protein-pseudotyped viruses with similar efficacy, whereas anti-CVS-11 serum neutralized CVS-11 G protein-pseudotyped virus significantly better than virus <italic>trans</italic>-complemented with the SAD G protein. The WHO reference serum, mAb 16DB4, and rabbit anti-CVS-11 serum also showed neutralizing activity against EBLV-1 or EBLV-2 G protein-pseudotyped VSV*&#x02206;G(Luc), however, the ND<sub>50</sub> values were very low. Immune serum raised against MOKV showed neutralizing activity exclusively against MOKV G protein-pseudotyped virus but not against any of the other pseudotype viruses tested. Vice versa, none of the other immune sera tested was able to neutralize pseudotype virus containing the MOKV G protein. These results provide further evidence for the specificity of the PVN test and also demonstrate that the assay can be easily adopted to allow the detection of neutralizing antibodies directed to other lyssaviruses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-viruses-08-00254"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The RFFIT and FAVN tests are currently the methods of choice for the detection and quantification of RABV neutralizing antibodies. Because these assays require the handling of live RABV, appropriate biosafety measures have to be conducted including vaccination of all laboratory workers and testing of their anti-RABV serum antibody levels on a regular basis. However, the RABV vaccine does not provide full protection against lyssaviruses other than RABV, in particular viruses of phylogroup 2 are not recognized by anti-RABV antibodies [<xref rid="B15-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The RFFIT test is rather time-consuming because cells have to be incubated for 24 h prior to detection of infected cells by direct immunofluorescence [<xref rid="B30-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Recombinant RABV expressing GFP may facilitate detection of infected cells [<xref rid="B34-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but still is a hazardous pathogen. Pseudotyping of G-deficient, non-replicative RABV is also feasible but suffers from slower reporter gene expression [<xref rid="B37-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected taking advantage of propagation-incompetent pseudotype virus particles that comply with biosafety level 1 or 2 (depending on the country you are working in). The rapid and strong expression of VSV-encoded reporter genes (GFP, luciferase) facilitated the detection of virus-infected cells and allowed the assay to be performed within 8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In particular, the luciferase reporter turned out to be highly sensitive and allowed detection of even a single infected cell. The secreted Nano luciferase turned out to be superior over the firefly luciferase as it did not require prior lysis of the cells and produced stronger signals. Luminescence was recorded using a plate reader, which allowed the analysis of several samples in short time. The definition of a luciferase cutoff value enabled us to discriminate between positive and negative wells and to calculate ND<sub>50</sub> values that were similar to those obtained with the GFP read-out (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). As an alternative read-out, the half maximal inhibitory serum/antibody concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) leading to 50% reduction of luciferase reporter activity may be calculated. This would allow detection of even lower levels of neutralizing antibodies, however, the data cannot be directly compared with standard ND<sub>50</sub> values. Compared to the conventional RFFIT and FAVN tests, which require a lot of counting of cells/foci with the risk of individual mistakes by the experimenter, the PVN test with the automated luciferase detection has the advantage of better reproducibility and provides the opportunity of better standardization.</p><p>The RFITT and FAVN tests require long incubation times in order to allow single non-neutralized virus to propagate. This is necessary to amplify the otherwise low immunofluorescence signal. A similar amplification can be achieved for the PVN test if doxycycline-induced helper cells are used for the assay rather than Vero or BHK-21 cells. On doxycycline-treated helper cells, the virus can perform two or more replication cycles, which will result in significant amplification of the reporter signal. Although the sensitivity of the PVN test is enhanced in this way, more time is needed to perform the assay. In order to avoid any interference of anti-RABV antibodies with the function of the <italic>trans</italic>-complementing envelope glycoprotein, it is recommended to use a helper cell line which expresses a heterologous glycoprotein, e.g., the VSV G protein.</p><p>Pseudotyping of VSV has been successfully performed with envelope glycoproteins derived from diverse viruses, indicating that incorporation of foreign viral glycoproteins into VSV particles occurs in a rather unspecific manner [<xref rid="B38-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Nevertheless, VSV might be particularly well suited for the uptake and presentation of lyssavirus glycoproteins because VSV belongs to the same virus family and has the same bullet-shaped morphology as RABV. The envelope of both VSV and RABV is derived from the plasma membrane where budding takes place and contains a single-type trimeric glycoprotein of similar size. It is therefore likely that VSV pseudotype particles present lyssavirus glycoproteins in their proper conformation, similar or identical to the conformation presented by authentic RABV. This aspect is important since a considerable fraction of virus-neutralizing antibodies may bind to conformation-dependent epitopes [<xref rid="B39-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Pseudotype particles can be produced quite easily by propagating VSV*&#x00394;G(Luc) or VSV*&#x00394;G(sNLuc) on helper cells expressing the viral glycoprotein of choice, e.g., RABV G protein. We used a conditional expression system because several viral glycoproteins, e.g., the VSV G protein [<xref rid="B32-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], are known to exhibit cytotoxic properties which may interfere with any constitutive expression of these glycoproteins. The <italic>trans</italic>-complementation of VSV*&#x00394;G by helper cells expressing the VSV G protein has never led to the emergence of propagation-competent VSV since this cell line was used for the first time more than 10 years ago [<xref rid="B22-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Probably, the tight association of the VSV nucleocapsid protein with viral genomic RNA makes any recombination with mRNAs extremely unlikely. The <italic>trans</italic>-complementation of G-protein-deleted VSV may also be achieved by transient expression of viral glycoproteins. However, transfection of cells is laborious and expensive and often results in low and unsteady pseudotype virus titers. As an alternative to <italic>trans</italic>-complemented virus particles, chimeric VSV may be produced in which the VSV G gene is replaced by a foreign viral glycoprotein [<xref rid="B38-viruses-08-00254" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, these propagation-competent viruses are free to mutate so that it cannot be ruled out that virulent viruses eventually evolve.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-viruses-08-00254"><title>5.
