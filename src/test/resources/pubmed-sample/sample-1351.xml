Doxorubicin, a potent anticancer anthracycline, is known to produce spermatogenic damage even in low doses. Although some studies have suggested that amifostine does not confer protection to doxorubicin-induced testicular damage, schedules and age of treatment have different approach depending on the protocol. Thus, we proposed to investigate the potential cytoprotective action of amifostine against the damage provoked by doxorubicin to prepubertal rat testes (30-day-old) by assessing some macro and microscopic morphometric parameters 15, 30 and 60 days after the treatment; for fertility evaluation, quantitative analyses of sperm parameters and reproductive competence in the adult phase were also carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-day-old male rats were distributed into four groups: Doxorubicin (5 mg/kg), Amifostine (400 mg/kg), Amifostine/Doxorubicin (amifostine 15 minutes before doxorubicin) and Sham Control (0.9% saline solution). "Standard One Way Anova" parametric and "Anova on Ranks" non-parametric tests were applied according to the behavior of the obtained data; significant differences were considered when p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rats killed 30 and 60 days after doxorubicin treatment showed diminution of seminiferous epithelium height and reduction on the frequency of tubular sections containing at least one type of differentiated spermatogonia; reduction of sperm concentration and motility and an increase of sperm anomalous forms where observed in doxorubicin-treated animals. All these parameters were improved in the Amifostine/Doxorubicin group only when compared to Doxorubicin group. Such reduction, however, still remained below the values obtained from the Sham Control group. Nevertheless, the reproductive competence of doxorubicin-treated rats was not improved by amifostine pre-administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that amifostine promotes a significant reduction of the doxorubicin long-term side effects on the seminiferous epithelium of prepubertal rats, which is reflected in the epidydimal fluid parameters in the adult phase. However, fertility status results suggest that such protection may not be effective against sperm DNA content damage. Further investigation of sperm DNA integrity must be carried out using amifostine and doxorubicin-treated experimental models.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A perfect chemotherapeutic treatment would selectively attack tumor cells without causing toxicity on normal tissues. Unfortunately, this ideal selectivity has not yet been reached by traditional chemotherapy, which is known to affect both neoplastic and proliferating normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Modern therapies using multiple combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs reduce the cytotoxicity of these drugs to normal tissues, increasing the survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, even after increasing the effectiveness of these treatments, many patients present post-chemotherapy sterility for about 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Besides, children and young patients exposed to chemotherapy in prepubertal phase can yet show irreversible impairment or loss of fertility status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Among various antineoplastic agents, doxorubicin, an anthracycline compound, is one of the most used anticancer drugs. Doxorubicin has recognized effectiveness against solid and non-solid malignant tumors and is used in oncology protocols against malignancies such as Hodgkin disease, childhood leukemia and testicular cancer, which commonly affect young patients and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is responsible for long and short-term male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The preferential target of doxorubicin is the DNA of dividing cells; the drug intercalates within DNA strands causing cell cycle blockage in the G<sub>2 </sub>phase, single-strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and inhibition of the activity of some nuclear proteins, such as DNA and RNA-polimerase and DNA-topoisomerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has been recently found that doxorubicin also interferes with an important molecule involved in chromosome stability and transcription, the DNA methyl-transferase 1 - DNMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], inducing apoptosis.</p><p>Clinical and experimental studies have widely demonstrated the testicular toxicity caused by doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Lu and Meistrich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] showed that even a low dose of doxorubicin (1 mg/kgb.w.) given to adult mice is able to target germ cells, mainly A1-A4 spermatogonia, leading to seminiferous epithelium depletion. Moreover, doxorubicin can also harm type B spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and primary spermatocytes depending on the treatment schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The fertility preservation of young patients submitted to anticancer treatments is an important aspect that must be considered, since the prognosis of 10-year survival after childhood leukemia has the projection to reach 90% until the end of 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, the chemotherapy schedules also need to be improved; on this scope, other supporting therapies must be investigated focusing on reducing undesirable effects and providing a better life quality to survivor patients. Amifostine, a cellular protector, has been additionally used in chemotherapy and radiotherapy with this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Amifostine (WR-2721) is an organic phosphorylated thyol, which was isolated by the US Army in the 1950's, aiming to protect soldiers against a possible nuclear war. Initial clinical trials were focused on the prevention of hematotoxicities produced by radiation, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin and cisplatin therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Besides the remarkable cytoprotection of amifostine against toxicities and side effects provoked by chemotherapeutic drugs, performed by its dephosphorylated metabolite, the WR-1065 free thyol, it also exhibits selective protection to normal cells without reducing the antitumor drug effectiveness. This selectivity is a consequence of some mechanisms that ease the capture of WR-1065 in normal tissues, which are much more vascularized than tumoral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, in non-tumoral tissues the alkaline phosphatase has the favorable neutral pH for its adequate activity, required to dephosphorilate the WR2721 (amifostine) to the active metabolite, WR-1065 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This metabolite acts as ROS scavenger and stabilizes intact DNA inside normal cell nucleus, inhibiting DNA intercalation and breakage caused by antineoplastic drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; such stability also improves the DNA ability to self-repair after any DNA damage that might have occurred after antitumoral treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Although WR-2721 is being included in anticancer treatment schedules for both radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], there is scarce information about its chemical interactions and its systemic effects, especially in young patients and children. Although some works have been published presenting <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>results after exposure of young rats to both drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], there are no detailed morphological studies concerning the potential protection conferred by amifostine to the seminiferous epithelium integrity and its recovery capacity. Moreover, since many children and adolescents have already been submitted to amifostine treatment prior to chemotherapy protocols including doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the extension of the effects on male reproduction still need to be answered.</p><p>Until the present moment, there is no often information related to the fertility of patients who were simultaneously exposed to doxorubicin and amifostine during childhood and adolescence. Besides, previous findings by our group indicated that amifostine partially protects germ cells of prepubertal rats against apoptosis caused by cisplatin, another chemotherapeutic drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, considering the wide use of doxorubicin against malignant neoplasm and the fact that infertility has become a common consequence of these treatments, we decided to investigate whether acute and previous administration of amifostine to prepubertal rats can protect their seminiferous epithelium against the doxorubicin acute treatment. For that reason, during the sexual maturation of the rats (prepubertal, pubertal and young adult phases), the impact of these treatments on the frequency of germ cell types and on testicular stereological and morphometric parameters was scrutinized. Adult fertility was also analyzed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and groups</title><p>Sixty 30-day-old male Wistar rats were distributed into four groups: Doxorubicin (D), Amifostine (A), Amifostine/Doxorubicin (AD) and Sham Control (SC). The animals were killed at 3 different times after treatment (15, 30 and 60 days after it), subdividing all the groups into 3 subgroups according to the killing ages (45-, 60- and 90-day-old rats). Thus, 12 subgroups of 5 animals each were established. The number indicated in each subgroup acronym corresponds to the sacrifice age. Additional males were included in each ninety-day-old group (totaling 10 males per group) to evaluate their reproductive competence. Rats were maintained under 12/12 hr light/dark cycles, at 21-23&#x000b0;C room temperature; standardized lab chow (Nuvilab CR1, Nuvital<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Curitiba, PR, Brazil) and water were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research of the Federal University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocols of treatment</title><p>The experimental and control groups were the following: Sham Control group (SC), treated with 0.5 ml of 0.9% saline solution; Amifostine group (A) that received 400 mg/kg of amifostine ("Ethyol" or WR-2721; Schering-Plough S/A, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil); Doxorubicin group (D), treated with 5 mg/kg of doxorubicin (Eurofarma, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil); Amifostine/Doxorubicin group (AD), treated with amifostine (400 mg/kg) 15 min prior to the doxorubicin injection (5 mg/kg). All the treatments were given by intraperitoneal route. Both amifostine and doxorubicin were diluted in 0.9% of physiological saline solution immediately before application, according to the manufacturer's instructions and were administered in single doses.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological procedures and histopathological analysis</title><p>Before the euthanasia, the rats were anaesthetized with thiopental (Tiopentax; Cris&#x000e1;lia Produtos Qu&#x000ed;micos e Farmac&#x000ea;uticos, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil); their testes were removed and immersed in Bouin's fixative for 48 hrs. Testicular fragments were processed and Paraplast-Plus<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) embedded. Three &#x003bc;m-thick cross sections (two non-consecutive cross sections from each testis) were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin or submitted to the Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) method and counterstained with Hematoxylin (PAS+H). The PAS+H method was used since it is a histochemical method that assures an efficient identification of spermatid steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Two hundred tubular sections per animal (one hundred per testis) were randomly analyzed using the Leica QWin V3 (Cambridge, UK) image analysis system and &#x000d7;20 objective lens.

For this aim, fifty PAS-treated seminiferous tubule sections per testis (left and right testes) were randomly examined at &#x000d7;1000 magnification, totaling 100 tubular sections per animal.

The volume densities (Vv) of Tubular Lumen (VvTL), Seminiferous Epithelium (VvEp), Lymphatic Space (VvLS) and Interstitial Tissue (VvIT) were obtained. For this purpose, a 25-point integrating eyepiece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] was coupled to a light microscope. Thirty random fields of right and left cross sections of each testis were analyzed at 125&#x000d7; magnification, totaling 750 points per testis (1500 points per animal).</p><p>Tubular diameter and seminiferous epithelium height of 50 random tubular cross-sections per testis were analyzed, using a micrometer eyepiece attached to a light binocular microscope, at 80&#x000d7; magnification.

An aliquot (50 &#x003bc;l) of the sperm homogenate was placed on a slide for motility assessment. Motile (showing any kind of movement) and non-motile (steady) sperm cells were counted within 5 different fields. An hour after the sperm diffusion in saline solution, sperm counts were performed in a hematocytometer chamber (Neubauer Bright Line Improved, 0.100 mm). Morphological analyses of spermatozoa smears of control and experimental rats were also performed. The smears were stained using Shorr/Hematoxylin method and the percentages of normal and abnormal spermatozoa were counted (200 spermatozoa/rat). The determinant abnormal characteristics considered were: a) the shape and size of spermatozoa head, including big or small heads, with lighter or accentuated curvature; b) intermediary pieces defects resulting untied heads; c) defects of tails including short, multiple, folded or broken tails.</p></sec><sec><title>Reproductive competence</title><p>Each fifteen 90-day-old males from SC, A, D and AD groups were mated with two normal primiparous females in proestrous.

However, the analysis of the data, which were obtained after the elapsed time of sixty days (from treatment to the euthanasia of 90D and 90AD rats), showed that the amifostine pre-treatment did not guarantee fertility improvement of the sequentially doxorubicin-treated animals, although some reduction of testis damage and an improvement of the sperm concentration, motility and morphology have been observed. The protective capacity of amifostine over some other tissues has already been proven to be effective against the deleterious action of gamma irradiation, taxanes, antracyclines and platinum derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Both doxorubicin and amifostine doses chosen to be used in this study were based on previous findings. Doxorubicin is usually administered to adult rats in doses up to 21 mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In rodents, the single dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight provokes disruption on spermatogenic cells maturation, epididymis sperm concentration reduction, alterations of spermatogonia DNA and sperm morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The aim of this study was to verify if a single dose of amifostine could reduce the long-term side effects on the seminiferous epithelium of sexually immature and adult rats, provoked by a unique cytotoxic dose of doxorubicin administered in the prepuberty. On the same way, the single dose of 400 mg/Kg of amifostine was selected due to its testicular minimal toxicity which could be neglected, as described by Meistrich and co-workers in murine assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; on the other hand, single higher doses or multiple lower doses have been referred to be toxic to the stem spermatogonia, diminishing their survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Few studies on the association of amifostine and doxorubicin in cancer therapy have been recently carried out; some of them produced contradictory results regarding the protection of the bone marrow and of cardiac and testicular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, amifostine potential protection against doxorubicin testicular toxicity seems to be a very delicate issue. Thus, we decided to carry out a detailed morphometric and stereological analyses of rat testes which constitute important unbiased tools to study biological tissue damages.</p><p>The alteration of the measurements of testicular volume and weight, for example, suggests injury of the gonad. In addition, parameters such as tubular diameter, seminiferous epithelium height and volume densities of tubular lumen and seminiferous epithelium can also give information about the testicular damage degree as a consequence of germ cell death. Fran&#x000e7;a and Russell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] have mentioned that when a massive germ cell loss occurs, it is followed by a sharp decline in testicular morphometric parameters. In general, germ cell death caused by anticancer drugs, including doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], culminates with a reduction of morphometric parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, our data suggest that germ cell loss is not necessarily associated with the reduction of these parameters since the occurrence of other phenomenon can interfere in the final establishment of the testis weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In fact, alterations of testicular weight were not observed in doxorubicin and amifostine-treated rats; since germ cell loss was noticed, the unaltered weight might be a consequence of a lymphatic and/or interstitial edema that counterbalance germ cell death and the organ weight. Interstitial edema is a testicular injury and a direct consequence of endothelial layer disruption, which liberates fluids from blood flow into interstitial tissue. Thus, testicular interstitial fluid volume can be increased by a variety of factors including testosterone level alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and toxic exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Indeed, doxorubicin causes endothelial dysfunction and edema, as secondary effects of oxidative stress in the vascular wall. The vascular endothelium plays a fundamental role in maintenance of organ function by forming a barrier regulating water and solute distribution between blood and tissues; however, this fluid control can be deregulated by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], resulting in movement of water and proteins from the vascular system into tissues and compromising organ function. In fact, in 90-day-old rats of the AD group, for example, the lymphatic capillary volume density was conspicuously increased when compared to the other corresponding groups in the same age. Future studies must be carried out to clarify the effects of amifostine on testis interstitial tissue, and the impact of the interaction of the amifostine and doxorubicin on the hormonal regulation of the male reproductive system, the endothelial dysfunction and testicular edema occurrence, as well as their roles on the morphophysiology of the interstitial tissue.</p><p>In spite of the adverse effects observed on the lymphatic space volume density, it was noted a distinctive reduction of the seminiferous epithelium damage in the 60-day-old rats treated with amifostine/doxorubicin, in comparison to those solely doxorubicin-treated. Indeed, amifostine seems to reduce the damage and the germ cell loss caused by the acute doxorubicin treatment and this can be confirmed when the present data related to the epithelium height and volume density from the 60- and 90-day-old doxorubicin-treated rats previously treated or not with amifostine were compared. The analysis of the spermatogonia frequencies also corroborates this idea. The depletion of seminiferous epithelium and the consequent decrease of morphometric and stereological measurements caused by cytotoxic agents were shown by Meistrich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and were confirmed in our report. As previously referred, a significant reduction of the frequency of tubules containing at least one type of differentiated spermatogonia (types A, Intermediate and B) occurred in the doxorubicin groups, in comparison to the amifostine-pretreated groups. Although spermatogonia are not the only cell type of the seminiferous epithelium under continuous division, their localization in the basal portion of the epithelium make them more vulnerable to the action of cytotoxic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Considering that, in rats, the complete seminiferous epithelium cycle lasts 12 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], we can suppose that, according to the elapsed time between treatment and the euthanasia of the animals applied in our study (15, 30 or 60 days), the cells generated from the target spermatogonia were: pachytene spermatocytes at 15 days; round spermatids at 30 days and mature sperm that reach the epididymis cauda at 60 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Even though the total number of each cell type was not quantified in the current study, we can assume based on the results that there was higher cell loss from the seminiferous tubules in the solely doxorubicin-treated rats in comparison to those which were previously amifostine-treated. On the other hand, it is plausible to consider that the progression of cellular maturation could be deregulated by amifostine treatment based on the alterations of the frequencies of tubular sections containing intermediate spermatogonia and spermatids, which were observed in the 45-day-old rats from amifostine-treated subgroups (45A and 45AD). We believe that such alteration might have occurred due to one of the amifostine protective mechanisms of DNA interaction, i.e., producing its stabilization and inhibiting nuclear proteins, such as topoisomerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and DNA-polimerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], which were involved in cell division. Thus, while intercalated with the DNA, amifostine prevents doxorubicin linkage with cell DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The decreased frequency of tubular sections with spermatids observed in 45AD subgroup, even when compared to 45A subgroup, might have occurred as a consequence of interference on the cell cycle caused by amifostine-doxorubicin association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, this effect was reversible since it was only detected in 45-day-old rats.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that two studies carried out by a same group have shown amifostine toxicity to 6-day-old rat germ cells when associated with doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In their most recent study they have suggested that the treatment with amifostine (200 mg/kg) prior to doxorubicin (3 mg/kg b.w.) did not provide any protection against apoptosis induced in rat stem spermatogonia of 6-day-old rats, whereas 16- and 24-day-old animals did not show increase of cell death caused by doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Considering the low dose used in the aforementioned study, it is probable that the seminiferous epithelium of 16-day-old rats is more resistant to the doxorubicin than that of the 6-day-old rats, since the hematotesticular barrier begins to be established at the age of 15 days, according to Schulze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. As previously demonstrated by our group, 30-day-old rats did not show considerable toxicity after treatment with a 400 mg/kg single dose of amifostine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, the chosen dose of doxorubicin used in the present experiment was unable to cause mortality or reduction of body weight in rats at all studied ages, although morphological damages of seminiferous epithelium have occurred as a consequence of its cytotoxicity.</p><p>Doxorubicin is known to produce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] on dividing cells, as etoposide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our histological findings suggest that doxorubicin cytotoxicity was responsible for producing the frequently observed apoptotic round spermatids and multinucleated apoptotic cells. The intercalation of doxorubicin in the germ cell DNA during division is considered to be the principal cause of cellular death induction in the seminiferous epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Even escaping from death, the cells affected by doxorubicin can still have its genome damaged, provoking further impairments on cell progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Confirming our histological findings, sperm analysis from the epididymal fluid also suggests that amifostine could confer partial protection for cell survival. The significantly higher sperm concentration obtained in prior-amifostine-treated rats leads us to believe that there were a higher number of resistant spermatogonia in these animals. However, reproductive competence results alerted us about the level of the protection conferred by amifostine against the potential damage produced on sperm membrane and DNA integrity after doxorubicin exposure. Under the experimental conditions used here, amifostine conferred some germ cell protection against doxorubicin probably by preventing apoptosis of healthy and genetically damaged spermatogonia. If spermatogonia with harmed DNA survived, it is possible that they produced sperm with damaged DNA, although good sperm motility and morphology have been observed. Thus, the sperm with damaged DNA would be able to compete with normal sperm and produce abnormal embryos, what leads to the conclusion that such improvement in spermatogonia survival is disadvantageous for reproduction and embryo development. These subjects are under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Nowadays, the impairment of infertility remains a struggle for surviving patients who have undergone chemotherapy treatment, especially during childhood. As demonstrated in the current study, the testicular cytotoxicity caused by doxorubicin provokes serious germ cell depletion in the seminiferous epithelium of prepubertal rats. Our results have shown a reduction of seminiferous epithelium damage caused by doxorubicin and an improvement of the epididymal fluid sperm parameters in previously amifostine-treated rats; thus, they have pointed out for a partial protection of germ epithelium, although the aspects related to the combined administration of amifostine and doxorubicin and its impact on the germ cell genome components must be clarified. Spermatogonia survival promoted by amifostine was disadvantageous when doxorubicin was taken together, leading to reduced reproductive outcome. In this scope, sperm DNA integrity and its future contribution to the subsequent generation health might be a concern. Thenceforth, more detailed studies are necessary to investigate how they interact when concomitantly administered. In order to explore the potential cytoprotective benefits of amifostine, the protocols of administration and the age of treatment must be carefully considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SMM coordinated all steps of the study.
