Identifying breast cancer-specific signatures for metastasis and learning more about the nature of the genes involved in the metastatic process would 1) improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer progression and 2) reveal new therapeutic targets. Previous studies showed that the transcriptional regulator megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (Mkl1) induces tenascin-C expression in normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells. Tenascin-C is known to be expressed in metastatic niches, is highly induced in cancer stroma and promotes breast cancer metastasis to the lung.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using HC11 mammary epithelial cells overexpressing different Mkl1 constructs, we devised a subtractive transcript profiling screen to identify the mechanism by which Mkl1 induces a gene set co-regulated with tenascin-C. We performed computational analysis of the Mkl1 target genes and used cell biological experiments to confirm the effect of these gene products on cell behavior. To analyze whether this gene set is prognostic of accelerated cancer progression in human patients, we used the bioinformatics tool GOBO that allowed us to investigate a large breast tumor data set linked to patient data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We discovered a breast cancer-specific set of genes including tenascin-C, which is regulated by Mkl1 in a SAP domain-dependent, serum response factor-independent manner and is strongly implicated in cell proliferation, cell motility and cancer. Downregulation of this set of transcripts by overexpression of Mkl1 lacking the SAP domain inhibited cell growth and cell migration. Many of these genes are direct Mkl1 targets since their promoter-reporter constructs were induced by Mkl1 in a SAP domain-dependent manner. Transcripts, most strongly reduced in the absence of the SAP domain were mechanoresponsive. Finally, expression of this gene set is associated with high-proliferative poor-outcome classes in human breast cancer and a strongly reduced survival rate for patients independent of tumor grade.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights a crucial role for the transcriptional regulator Mkl1 and its SAP domain during breast cancer progression. We identified a novel gene set that correlates with bad prognosis and thus may help in deciding the rigor of therapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A)</kwd><kwd>Metastasis</kwd><kwd>Cancer progression</kwd><kwd>Prognosis</kwd><kwd>Gene regulation</kwd><kwd>Mechanical strain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Most breast cancer patients die from tumor metastases and not from the primary tumor itself. Thus, the identification of genes and signaling pathways influencing the metastatic process are of utmost importance. Once the mechanisms leading to metastasis are uncovered, they can in the future serve as a rational basis for prognosis and intervention. From the beginning of its discovery, tenascin-C has been strongly associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression in many different types of tumors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Tenascin-C was not only enriched in breast cancer tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but its high expression was part of a gene signature of breast cancers metastasizing to the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There is strong evidence that tenascin-C contributes to the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] by providing a niche for their settlement in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The source of tenascin-C can be the tumor cells themselves as well as the stromal cells of the cancer microenvironment. Downregulation of tenascin-C by miR-335 or shRNA in human cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model inhibits metastasis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and in tenascin-C-deficient mice, metastasis formation of tenascin-C positive cancer cells is also suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>There are many signaling pathways inducing tenascin-C expression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). Among these, mechanical strain application <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as to cells in culture is a potent stimulus to induce tenascin-C expression in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have recently shown that induction of tenascin-C by cyclic mechanical strain requires the action of Mkl1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mkl1 is a member of the myocardin-related transcription factor family (MRTF) and a well-known transcriptional co-activator of serum response factor (SRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. SRF target genes, which are regulated upon recruitment of MRTF cofactors, encode proteins involved in actin cytoskeletal function that can either be structural (for example, actin) or related to actin dynamics (for example, talin 1) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). However, Mkl1-mediated stretch-induced tenascin-C expression in fibroblasts did not require SRF, but instead depended on the potential DNA-binding SAP domain of Mkl1. This implies a novel mode of Mkl1 action as a <italic>bona fide</italic> transcription factor in mechanotransduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, normal and transformed mouse mammary epithelial cells also appear to be highly sensitive to Mkl1 signaling, responding to Mkl1 overexpression with several fold induction of tenascin-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The present study was designed to find SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes co-regulated with tenascin-C and to analyze whether such genes could be indicative of specific physiological states of cells that might be controlled by mechanotransduction. For our study, we made use of the HC11 mammary epithelial cell line. HC11 cells are capable of both self-renewal and differentiation and can be cultured for unlimited time in an undifferentiated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the condition we used in our study. HC11 cells can reconstitute the ductal epithelium of a cleared mammary fat pad <italic>in vivo</italic> with ductal, alveolar and myoepithelial cells, illustrating their stem cell abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, HC11 cells contain a mutated p53 gene that not only increases the replicative potential of stem cells but confers predisposition to mammary carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Undifferentiated HC11 cells share transcriptome signatures with human breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], supporting the relevance of this model for breast cancer-related studies. We therefore concluded our study by investigating whether the genes co-regulated with tenascin-C would also be implicated in breast cancer progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Screen for SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes</title><p>We devised a screening method to identify genes co-regulated with tenascin-C by Mkl1 in a SAP domain-dependent manner without involvement of SRF. For this purpose, we used HC11 mammary epithelial cells that react strongly to the overexpression of Mkl1 with induction of tenascin-C expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We compared three HC11 strains that either overexpress the C-terminal red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged full length Mkl1 (HC11-FL), Mkl1-RFP with a mutated SRF-interaction site (HC11-mutB1) or Mkl1-RFP with a deletion of the SAP domain (HC11-&#x00394;SAP). None of the three Mkl1 variants appear to be toxic to the cells, as we have not observed any changes in viability or cell morphology. HC11-FL cells were shown to overexpress Mkl1 7.1-fold above the endogenous Mkl1 present in parental HC11 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and were used as control cells in our study. All cell strains were FACS sorted to express similar levels of Mkl1-RFP proteins. These cells were used for transcript profiling and gene lists of interest were established as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, B. A scatter plot (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) of all transcripts expressed in HC11-mutB1 versus HC11-FL control cells (y-axis) and all transcripts expressed in HC11-&#x00394;SAP versus HC11-FL control cells (x-axis) shows that a large majority of transcripts does not differ significantly between the three cell strains (log fold change (FC)&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;0; black dots). Setting the threshold to a 2-fold reduction (logFC&#x02009;=&#x02009;-1; grey lines), three gene sets can be distinguished: 1) blue dots represent genes that are lower in HC11-mutB1 than in HC11-FL control cells, but are unaffected in HC11-&#x00394;SAP cells, thus representing typical SRF/Mkl1 target genes; 2) green dots represent genes that are lower in HC11-&#x00394;SAP than in HC11-FL control cells, but are unaffected in HC11-mutB1 cells (this gene set includes tenascin-C); and 3) red dots indicate genes with reduced expression in both HC11-mutB1 and HC11-&#x00394;SAP cells compared to HC11-FL control cells. Thus, this approach enabled us to form three gene sets that were distinct from the large majority of transcripts and were dependent for expression on the B1 site of Mkl1, the SAP domain, or both. The three groups presented by a Venn diagram (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) contain 141 probesets for transcripts that depended on the function of the B1 site but not the SAP domain for their induction, 113 probesets for transcripts that depended on both of these Mkl1 domains and a third group of 205 probesets for transcripts co-regulated with tenascin-C that did not require an interaction of Mkl1 with SRF but depended on the SAP domain for induction (complete probeset lists and annotations are found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table S3). This analysis revealed that the SAP-dependent mechanism of tenascin-C regulation by Mkl1 is shared by a large cohort of genes. Below the Venn diagram, we indicated which cells were deficient in the respective transcripts. Thus, the typical SRF/Mkl1 target genes are reduced in HC11-mutB1 cells, while the SRF-independent/SAP-dependent genes are reduced in HC11-&#x00394;SAP cells. The intermediate group that requires both Mkl1 activities is reduced in both the HC11-mutB1 and HC11-&#x00394;SAP cells.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Screen for SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes and their implication in cancer.

Thus, the SRF-dependent/SAP-independent signature implicated a function of these genes in cellular movement and the linked diseases included connective tissue disorders, inflammatory disease and skeletal and muscle disorders, which are the main features known to be regulated by SRF/Mkl1 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The SRF-dependent/SAP-dependent group of genes includes as major functions post-translational modification, protein degradation and protein synthesis, and the top disease association is cancer. Finally, the genes of the SRF-independent/SAP-dependent group were associated with extremely high significance with cell cycle and cancer (-logP&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25 and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30, respectively), while the SRF/Mkl1 target genes were associated with the same two categories at low significance only (-logP&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7, respectively). These data imply that SAP-dependent induction of transcription by Mkl1 may counteract the known differentiation-promoting effect of SRF/Mkl1-induced transcription. A list of SAP-dependent genes with published cancer-related functions, whose transcripts were downregulated more than 3-fold in HC11-&#x00394;SAP compared to HC11-FL control cells, is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. To confirm that these transcripts are indeed differentially expressed in the different HC11 cell strains, qRT-PCR analysis was performed using cDNA from three different batches of the respective HC11 strains. Differences in gene expression between HC11-&#x00394;SAP and control cells are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and in more detail in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S1. The qRT-PCR results agreed with the data obtained by transcript profiling. We also tested the SAP-dependent gene expression in the HC11 strains when grown in the presence of serum. It is interesting to note that in the presence of 3% FCS, these transcripts remained strongly reduced in HC11-&#x00394;SAP compared to control cells (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, the induction of these genes seems to depend mainly on whether the SAP domain is present in the transfected Mkl1 construct.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table

In agreement with the changes seen at the transcript level, we confirmed the reduction of tenascin-C, Wisp1 and Nox4 proteins in cells overexpressing the &#x00394;SAP-Mkl1 construct compared to the HC11-FL control and HC11-mutB1 cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S2). Using zymography, we found that Mmp2, a gene that was not affected by Mkl1 overexpression at the transcript level was highly expressed in all three cell strains, whereas Mmp3 and/or 12, which belonged to the SRF-dependent/SAP-dependent gene set, were almost completely lacking in HC11-mutB1 as well as HC11-&#x00394;SAP cells, corresponding to the data obtained by transcript profiling.</p></sec><sec><title>SRF-independent/SAP-dependent transcripts represent direct Mkl1 target genes</title><p>Since we have previously shown that the SAP domain of Mkl1 interacts with the proximal promoter of tenascin-C to induce its transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we tested whether this was also the case for other transcripts of the same group. The promoters of the SRF-independent/SAP-dependent genes listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> encompassing at least 500&#x000a0;bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) were fused to the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene of pSEAP2-Basic. We tested the induction of each promoter-reporter construct by co-transfection with FL-Mkl1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). This revealed that the majority of the new promoters tested (8 out of 12) were induced at least 2-fold by Mkl1 in comparison to co-transfection with an inactive Mkl1 devoid of the transactivation domain, indicating that these are indeed direct Mkl1 target genes. The promoter constructs that did not respond to Mkl1 overexpression may represent genes that are indirectly regulated by Mkl1, or the relevant promoter regions were not contained in the constructs tested. Next, we investigated whether the induction was SAP-dependent and SRF-independent by comparing the reporter activity after co-transfection with mutB1- versus &#x00394;SAP-Mkl1 variants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Indeed, the promoter-reporter constructs induced by FL-Mkl1 were also strongly induced by mutB1-Mkl1, but not by &#x00394;SAP-Mkl1. In contrast, the promoter construct for Acta2, a gene from the SRF-dependent/SAP-independent gene set was strongly induced by &#x00394;SAP-Mkl1 but not by mutB1-Mkl1, as expected for a typical SRF/Mkl1 target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. All promoters that revealed SAP-dependency were shortened to 200&#x000a0;bp upstream of the TSS to test whether this was sufficient to relay the Mkl1 response, as it has been seen previously for tenascin-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. With the exception of Krt5 and Nox4, for which some activity was lost by shortening the promoters, the 200&#x000a0;bp proximal promoters of all other genes tested were induced equally well as the longer constructs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Thus, we conclude that there are many genes that are regulated similarly as tenascin-C requiring the SAP domain of Mkl1 to induce transcription from their proximal promoter.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>SRF-independent/SAP-dependent transcripts represent direct Mkl1 target genes requiring the SAP domain of Mkl1 to induce transcription from their proximal promoter.

Since most of the SAP-dependent transcripts are proposed to have a function in cancer, we decided to analyze two main functions important for cancer progression: proliferation and cell migration. An approximately equal overexpression of the different Mkl1 protein variants in the HC11 cell lines was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). An HC11 cell strain stably transfected with an empty vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] expressing only endogenous Mkl1 (below the detection limit in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A) was also included in these studies.

To investigate cell motility, we used a transfilter migration assay. Similarly to the effect on cellular proliferation, the expression of &#x00394;SAP-Mkl1 significantly inhibited HC11 cell migration by 2.7-fold compared to endogenous or full length Mkl1 expression, and more than 3.5-fold compared to mutB1-Mkl1 expression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The different HC11 cell strains proliferate at different rates and show distinct migration behaviors.

Mammary epithelial cells are also exposed to mechanical strains, both during normal development, pregnancy and lactation, as well as under pathological conditions such as in cancer. Therefore, we tested whether tenascin-C and other members of the SAP-dependent Mkl1-induced gene set are mechanoresponsive in HC11 cells. We tested two paradigms: 1) static strain that was shown to induce c-fos, a very prominent mechanoresponsive gene in HC11 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] that we used as a control, and 2) cyclic strain. While we were able to confirm induction of c-fos by applying static strain at 20% for 1&#x000a0;h, there was no induction of tenascin-C under these conditions compared to cells at rest (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). However, using 15% cyclic strain at a frequency of 0.3&#x000a0;Hz for 1&#x000a0;h, we found that not only the control gene c-fos but 11 out of 16 SAP-dependent genes, including tenascin-C were significantly upregulated above the expression levels obtained in resting cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Even though significant, the induction of tenascin-C was minimal (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A) compared to 18-fold upregulation for Adamts16 or 10-fold upregulation for Lox (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B), both of which are enzymes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].

GOBO is designed to assess gene expression levels and association with outcome of single genes or gene sets in multiple subgroups of this breast cancer data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Here, we analyzed two sets of genes, namely the SRF/Mkl1-induced gene set (SRF-dependent/SAP-independent) and the SAP-dependent gene set (SRF-independent/SAP-dependent) containing tenascin-C. The analysis was performed across tumor samples stratified according to PAM50 subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], estrogen receptor (ER)-status and histological grade. In contrast to the SRF/Mkl1 target genes that were predominantly associated with tumors classified as normal-like and with lower histological grades (1 and 2) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A), elevated expression of SAP-dependent genes was associated with extremely high significance (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001) with typical high-proliferative poor outcome classes in breast cancer, such as basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal B, ER-negative and histological grade 3 tumors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). Next, a functional correlation analysis to find a possible interconnection between the SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes was performed using the GOBO tool (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S3). This analysis explores the correlation of expression of individual genes in our gene sets with eight different co-expressed gene modules emulating breast cancer-specific as well as general tumor biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Interestingly, whereas the gene set of SRF/Mkl1 targets did not show a significant correlation with any of these modules, the genes in the SAP-dependent gene set were correlated with a very high significance (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001) with two proliferation modules &#x02013; mitotic checkpoint and mitotic progression. Both modules contain genes related to central mitotic processes involved in either the regulation of the M-phase and the mitotic checkpoint or in carrying out the M-phase. Finally, the association of our gene sets with outcome using distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) as an endpoint and 10-year censoring was analyzed. The survival analysis was performed in all tumors for which DMFS follow-up is available (1379 cases), as well as in 21 groups that were stratified based on gene expression subtypes (PAM50 classifier), ER-status, lymph node (LN)-status, histological grade, and treatment status. Samples in the whole cancer data set (1881 patients) were stratified into three quantiles, low, intermediate and high, based on SRF-dependent/SAP-independent or SRF-independent/SAP-dependent gene expression. Interestingly, high expression of SRF/Mkl1-induced genes was associated with a better clinical outcome for all tumors, as well as for LN-negative and untreated tumors compared to low and intermediate expression of these genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). In contrast, both high and intermediate expression of the SAP-dependent genes was associated with bad clinical outcome in all tumors, and particularly in LN-negative, systemically untreated, ER-positive, Grade 1 and 2 tumors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Similar results were obtained for the typical breast cancer gene CCNB1 by Ringn&#x000e9;r et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were supported by the corresponding multivariate analyses (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A, B). The hazard ratio for the variate Grade shows statistical significance, proving that the influence of high SAP-dependent gene expression on patient survival is independent of tumor grade. Among all tumors for which DMFS data are available, a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28-0.68; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0003) for the low SRF-independent/SAP-dependent tercile was detected compared to the high SRF-independent/SAP-dependent tercile (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B, all tumors). This indicates that patients with tumors expressing high levels of the SAP-dependent genes are more than twice as likely to develop metastatic disease. Similar hazard ratios, in the range of 0.28-0.44 for the low tercile compared to the high tercile were also detected among subgroups of untreated, LN-negative, ER-positive, Grade 1 and 2 tumors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). Thus, the association of high SRF-independent/SAP-dependent gene expression with reduced DMFS among patients not receiving adjuvant therapy, as well as among LN-negative, ER-positive, Grade 1 and 2 patients indicates that increased expression of the SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes plays a significant role in the natural metastatic progression of non-aggressive towards highly aggressive breast cancer in human patients.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes are associated with typical high-proliferative poor outcome classes in breast cancer.</bold> The expression levels for the SRF-dependent/SAP-independent <bold>(A)</bold> and SRF-independent/SAP-dependent <bold>(B)</bold> gene sets are analyzed across the 1881-sample breast cancer data set stratified according to PAM50 subtypes (left panels), estrogen receptor (ER)-status (middle panels) and histological grade (right panels), and represented by box plots using the GOBO bioinformatics tool.

We have recently shown that induction of tenascin-C by cyclic mechanical strain required the action of the potential DNA-binding SAP domain of Mkl1 independently of an interaction of Mkl1 with SRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Now, we report a screen for genes co-regulated with tenascin-C by the same SAP-dependent and SRF-independent mechanism in mammary epithelial cells. This screen reveals a set of SAP domain-dependent Mkl1 target genes with a strong implication in cell proliferation, cell motility and cancer.</p><p>To date only a few studies have shown that Mkl1 is implicated in cancer-related processes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]) and most of them have concentrated on the SRF/Mkl1 signaling for the induction of individual genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. The first study reporting that depletion of Mkl1/2 proteins reduced motility, invasion and colonization of metastatic tumor cells in an experimental <italic>in vivo</italic> metastasis assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] was further supported by the discovery of the Mkl1-binding protein, suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI), which inhibited SRF/Mkl1-mediated expression of &#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Since then, several studies describing opposing biological effects for Mkl1 appeared. For instance, several antiproliferative SRF/Mkl1 target genes including mig6/errfi-1, a negative regulator of the EGFR-MAPK pathway, were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], or the tumor suppressor gene Eplin-&#x003b1; was described as a direct target of the SRF/Mkl1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively active form of Mkl1 in oncogenic ras- or src-transformed rat intestinal epithelial cells injected into the spleen of nude mice significantly suppressed tumor formation and reduced liver metastases by rescuing the expression of the SRF/Mkl1 targets tropomyosin and caldesmon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. In line with these findings, we could show that high expression of SRF/Mkl1 target genes is associated with an improved clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. However, the opposite is the case for high expression of SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes. These genes are associated with poor clinical outcome predominantly in less aggressive tumors such as LN-negative, ER-positive, Grade 1 and 2 tumors, which makes them valuable predictors of breast cancer progression. A scheme that depicts our model for Mkl1 action in breast cancer is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. In this model Mkl1 is transactivating SRF-target genes in less aggressive tumors, while in the course of cancer progression and metastatic behavior Mkl1 is activating a new group of genes in a SAP-dependent manner either by direct interaction with the promoters of these genes or by interaction with additional DNA-binding factors.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the Mkl1 action in breast cancer.</bold> A circular Mkl1 model is depicted with four of its domains: RPEL, actin binding motifs with RPxxxEL core consensus; B1, basic domain involved in SRF-binding; SAP, homology domain found in the nuclear proteins SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS; TAD, transactivation domain.

Mkl1 exerts two distinct modes of action: one of them is through the B1 domain required for serum response factor (SRF)-binding activity and induction of SRF/Mkl1 target gene expression; the other one is strongly dependent on the SAP domain and triggers the expression of a specific set of pro-proliferative and pro-migratory genes that we called SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes. High expression of SRF-dependent genes is associated with good clinical outcome for breast cancer patients, whereas elevated expression of SAP-dependent targets correlates with poor prognosis and indicates a significant role for these genes in breast cancer progression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-13-22-8"/></fig><p>Interestingly, in parental HC11 cells many of the genes that we found in the SAP-dependent gene set that foster cell proliferation and migration and may cause poor survival of breast cancer patients are also induced by mechanical strain. A recent study has demonstrated that inhibition of cell spreading due to a lack of matrix stiffness is overcome by externally applied stretch, suggesting that similar mechanotransduction mechanisms sense stiffness and stretch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Tumor stroma is typically stiffer than normal stroma. In breast cancer, diseased tissue can be 10 times stiffer than normal breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. It is known that abnormal ECM stiffness plays an important role in cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>], but the mechanisms by which stiffness influences cancer progression are still under investigation. If we assume that we have discovered a general reaction of mammary epithelial cells to mechanical strain, we envisage that epithelial cells in a stiff, mechanically dynamic tumor environment may react by inducing a SAP-dependent Mkl1 gene set that in turn affects tumor progression. Furthermore, the products of these genes, many of which are involved in ECM turnover and function, for example Lox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], Mmps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], Adamts16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or Wisp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] might themselves manipulate the tumor microenvironment, thereby influencing tumor cell survival by a positive tumorigenic feedback loop.</p><p>Finding how to switch the mode of action of Mkl1 between SRF transactivation versus its SAP-dependent transcriptional activity is a subject of ongoing research in our lab that in future may help with the development of new therapeutic interventions for breast cancer. Post-translational modifications such as sumoylation are known to influence Mkl1 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] and phosphorylation has been shown to influence interaction of Mkl1 with nuclear actin resulting in transcriptional changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Further characterization of these and other post-transcriptional changes of Mkl1 deserve special attention when trying to answer the above question.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the current study, we discovered a breast cancer-specific set of genes that is highly interesting as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for several reasons. (1) The expression of this gene set is regulated by Mkl1 and its SAP domain and is independent of SRF. (2) The SAP-dependent, SRF-independent Mkl1signaling is triggered by mechanical strain and may thus be activated in stiff tumors with a high stromal content and high interstitial tissue pressure. (3) This gene set is composed of interesting members some of which represent novel candidates for playing a functional role in cancer and others that have already been implicated in cancer-related functions, as for example tenascin-C, a metastatic niche component important for lung colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], or Lox as a gene mediating collagen crosslinking responsible for fibrosis-enhanced metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. (4) The SAP-dependent Mkl1 target genes are associated with a poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, not receiving adjuvant therapy or having a cancer classified as non-aggressive such as LN-negative, ER-positive, Grade 1 or 2 tumors. This makes these genes potential valuable prognostic markers in selecting patients who may benefit from an immediate and/or more aggressive therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Full length Mkl1 (FL-Mkl1) and the two Mkl1 mutants, mutB1-Mkl1 comprising alanine substitutions of four amino acids (underlined) in the B1 domain of Mkl1 (KKAKELKPKVKKLKYHQYIPPDQKQD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] and &#x02206;SAP-Mkl1 with a deletion of the SAP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], were constructed based on transcript variant 1 (GenBank accession number NM_153049) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].
