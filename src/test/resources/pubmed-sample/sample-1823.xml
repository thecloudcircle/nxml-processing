Two surveys (Sv1, <italic>n</italic> = 441 and Sv2, <italic>n</italic> = 768) containing closed and open questions were conducted. Nearly 70% of Sv1 and Sv2 participants were unaware that meat of entire males may have boar taint and that SC is widely used in pig production in Brazil. In Sv1, acceptability of SC+PC (63%) and IC (53%) was greater than of SC (15%). In Sv2, acceptability of IC (55%) and EM (52%) was greater than of SC (18%). Open-ended responses indicated that participants objected to inflicting pain to pigs to attain a production goal, and were concerned with organoleptic traits and risks of exogenous residues in pork. Participants&#x02019; views regarding the potential increases in the cost of meat due to adoption of alternative methods varied; some argued that avoiding pain justifies an increase in the price of pork and others that this would impact especially lower income citizens. Our findings indicate that participants opposed surgical castration without pain control, and supported alternative methods. However, the concern with potential risks of presence of residues in meat, expressed by a few participants, may need to be addressed among consumers. </p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>animal welfare</kwd><kwd>boar taint</kwd><kwd>immunocastration</kwd><kwd>public perceptions</kwd><kwd>risk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-animals-10-01826"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Castration of piglets is a routine practice in pig farms around the world. The main reason for this procedure is to eliminate boar taint, an unpleasant flavor caused by androstenone and skatole, two substances that accumulate in fat tissue and release an unpleasant smell and taste when pork is cooked [<xref rid="B1-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The most commonly used method is surgical castration of neonatal piglets [<xref rid="B3-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Surgical castration without analgesia induces endocrine and behavioral responses that are considered indicators of pain; for example, newly castrated pigs spend less time nursing than non-castrated pigs, remain inactive longer while awake, and show more pain-related behaviors, such as prostration, stiffness, and tremors [<xref rid="B6-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The use of pain control protocols may address the pain and suffering. However, any method used must be suitable in the farm context; i.e., it must be easy to perform, not require expensive equipment, and promote significant reduction or elimination of pain, discomfort, and stress for piglets. Studies validating the effectiveness of different pain control protocols have reported mixed results [<xref rid="B7-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, handling and recovery associated with anesthesia and analgesia are a source of stress, and drugs used may have temporary nociceptive effects [<xref rid="B6-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Europe, pain control is increasingly used, but still mostly restricted to countries where its use is legally required [<xref rid="B3-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>An option to avoid surgical castration is immunocastration. This method consists of an injectable vaccine that immunizes the pig against its endogenous GnRH, which inhibits testicular development and function, reducing skatole and steroids levels in the blood [<xref rid="B13-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The method has positive effects on productivity and meat quality [<xref rid="B15-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and produces pork with acceptable organoleptic qualities [<xref rid="B17-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Immunocastration avoids the labor involved on surgical castration but adds the need for two injections, one of them when the pigs are older and heavier; also, concern with work-related accidents requires trained staff [<xref rid="B18-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The production of entire males with acceptable levels of boar taint is also feasible through a combination of early slaughter and specific feeding and environmental measures [<xref rid="B19-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Raising immunocastrated or entire males may offer economic benefits such as faster growth, enhanced feed conversion, and leaner carcasses. However, entire animals need to be slaughtered before puberty to avoid boar taint, which results in lighter carcasses [<xref rid="B18-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, control of sexual and aggressive behavior in entire males requires adequate management of the environment [<xref rid="B19-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Genetic selection of animals with low levels of skatole and aldosterone, or gene edition to produce animals with these traits may be possible, but both require further development and have additional implications on fertility [<xref rid="B21-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Cultural and regulatory issues may influence farmers&#x02019; attitudes towards the alternative measures to control boar taint and influence adoption. Many farmers consider methods to replace surgical castration without pain control unnecessary, ineffective, costly, or impractical [<xref rid="B23-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In some countries, the use of pharmacological tools requires the involvement of a veterinarian, which acts as a barrier to the adoption of pain mitigation [<xref rid="B26-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These factors are reflected in regional differences in the adoption of the methods. European countries successfully raise entire male pigs [<xref rid="B3-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], while immunocastration is increasingly used in countries like Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia, but not in Europe and the United States, where stakeholders are concerned with consumers&#x02019; acceptability of immunocastration [<xref rid="B17-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>However, adopting animal management practices that resonate with societal values is a key element for the sustainability of the livestock industry. Together with environmental, social, and food security issues, animal welfare is cited as a main challenge facing agriculture today [<xref rid="B28-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In order to maintain its&#x02019; social license, the livestock industry must regard the values of citizens and consumers. Although citizens in general are unaware of the husbandry practices and technologies used in animal production, when asked about surgical castration of pigs without anesthesia, most classify these practices as detrimental to animal welfare [<xref rid="B30-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Housing and management practices that are highly prevalent in intensive pig farming such as confinement, feeding practices that leave animals hungry for most of the day, and painful mutilations have become highly contentious [<xref rid="B34-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In 2002, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) passed a resolution to develop international animal welfare standards, which Brazil embraced, launching a series of measures and legislation aimed at regulating animal production [<xref rid="B36-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Attentive to their public image, food retail companies are pushing their suppliers to transition to better animal husbandry systems, such as housing pregnant sows in groups and ending piglets&#x02019; surgical castration and other painful mutilations, e.g., [<xref rid="B37-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Brazil is the world&#x02019;s fourth largest pig producer, after China, the European Union, and the United States; although the country is the fourth largest exporter after the European Union, United States, and Canada, 80% of the pig meat produced in Brazil is consumed in the country [<xref rid="B38-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite the importance of agriculture for the Brazilian economy, little is known about the attitudes of its citizens towards the production systems [<xref rid="B36-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although surgical castration without pain control is widely used in Brazil, a growing proportion of the farmers are moving to immunocastration [<xref rid="B39-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], with support from large retailers and industry stakeholders (see [<xref rid="B37-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B40-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). One study showed that Brazilian citizens had low awareness about pig castration but, when informed about it, expressed negative attitudes due to the pain it causes to the animals [<xref rid="B33-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, there is no information about the opinion of the public regarding the acceptability of immunocastration or raising entire males. </p><p>This study comprised two surveys, aiming to explore Brazilian citizens&#x02019; attitudes towards different methods to deal with the problem of boar taint in pork: surgical castration with or without pain control, immunocastration, or raising entire males. A secondary aim of the first survey was to explore the attitudes towards potential increases in pork price resulting from changing castration practices.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-animals-10-01826"><title>2. Materials and Methods </title><p>This study was approved by Ethics Committee on Experimentation of the Santa Catarina State University, PP 2.229.017 and 3.495.015. The two surveys will be thereafter called Sv1 and Sv2.</p><p>Until August 2020, slaughter of uncastrated male pigs was prohibited in Brazil, and for this reason, the option &#x0201c;raising entire males&#x0201d; was not included in the first survey. After extensive discussions and consultation with stakeholders, this prohibition was lifted in August 2020 [<xref rid="B41-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To present a complete overview of citizens&#x02019; attitudes to the issue of castration of pigs, a second survey was carried out, including the option of raising entire males for pork production. However, given the health regulations posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible to carry out face-to-face recruiting, the method of recruitment used in 2017. Thus, participants for the second survey were recruited online. </p><sec id="sec2dot1-animals-10-01826"><title>2.1. Recruitment and Questionnaires</title><p>Conditions to participate in the research were that the participant was a Brazilian citizen and at least 18 years old. The identity of the participants was not requested to guarantee their anonymity. Participant recruitment for Sv1 took place during October and November of 2017, at the Herc&#x000ed;lio Luz International Airport (Florian&#x000f3;polis, Brazil). The airport location was chosen because of the intense movement of people [<xref rid="B42-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. People waiting in the public airport hall located before security were approached and invited to participate in the study. Participants were asked if they would be willing to take a survey about animal production, with no specification of the nature of the issue, to reduce self-selection bias. Participants received a consent form and were asked to read and sign before taking the survey. The researcher stayed visible to answer any doubt, but did not provide any extra information while the participant filled out the questionnaire. Permanent residence in one of the three southern states of Brazil (i.e., Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paran&#x000e1; states) was a condition to participate in Sv1. Participants for Sv2 were recruited online between June and August 2020. An advertisement was posted on Brazilians&#x02019; social media inviting the public to participate in a survey about animals, without further information on the survey subject. The first question asked participants to identify themselves in relation to animal husbandry for food production (&#x02018;I am totally opposed to raising animals to produce food,&#x02019; &#x02018;I support the rearing of animals for food production, provided it is done in an ethical manner&#x02019;, or &#x02018;I support the rearing of animals for food production without restrictions&#x02019;), and only those that stated support for farm animal production were retained for this study. </p><p>In both surveys, participants were invited to read a short text before answering the questions (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="animals-10-01826-box001">Box A1</xref>), which outlined reasons behind castration and described castration techniques. In Sv1, participants were informed that Brazilian legislation states that all slaughtered male pigs must be castrated. In 2020, the legislation was revised removing this prohibition [<xref rid="B41-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, in Sv2, this information was not included and a short text about raising entire males was added. Detailed description of the questionnaires is available on <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01826">Supplementary Materials Tables S1 and S2</xref>. </p><p>Briefly, the questionnaire used for Sv1 was 6 pages long and included a total of 37 closed questions and 1 open question. After reading the text, participants were randomly assigned to rate and justify the acceptability of one of the three different techniques described there: &#x0201c;surgical castration&#x0201d; (SC), &#x0201c;surgical castration using medication to control pain&#x0201d; (SC+PC), or &#x0201c;immunocastration&#x0201d; (IC). If the participant answered about castration with pain control or immunocastration, two extra questions were asked&#x02014;the acceptability if the cost to produce increased up to 10%, and up to 30% of the current price. This was followed by an open question asking to justify their answers. Participants were then asked to rate their acceptability of the two other methods. </p><p>The questionnaire used for Sv2 included a total of 27 closed questions and 1 open question. Participants started the survey indicating which of the following elements they considered to be the most important in the production of meat for human consumption: avoiding techniques and forms of rearing that cause pain to the animals; avoiding management practices that deprive animals of freedom of movement; or ensuring meat production without undesirable residues. Participants were then randomly assigned to answer about &#x0201c;surgical castration&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;immunocastration&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;raising entire males&#x0201d; (EM), indicating on a 5-point Likert scale, whether they considered the treatment appropriate, whether they approved it, and whether they considered it acceptable. This was followed by an open question asking to justify their answers. </p><p>At the end of both questionnaires, participants were asked if they were aware of some pig production practices common in Brazil before participating in the survey (the order of the statements was randomized). Next, there were questions addressing participants&#x02019; socio-demographic information relating to sex, age, education, geographic region of current residence, urban or rural area, involvement with agriculture, and monthly family income (only in Sv2). The last two questions in Sv2 asked participants, &#x0201c;Do you believe that the current context associated with COVID-19 may have influenced your responses?&#x0201d;, with answers yes/no, followed by &#x0201c;please, justify your answer&#x0201d; and if they had or had ever had a castrated dog. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-animals-10-01826"><title>2.2.

In Sv1, a total of 441 valid usable questionnaires were collected and transcribed to the file for analysis. Participants that left closed questions unanswered and those that wrongly answered an attention question (&#x02018;Select &#x0201c;false&#x0201d; to validate your answers&#x02019;) were excluded (<italic>n</italic> = 63). Comparisons of Likert scale ratings between two groups was done with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (V value reported), and effects of demographic variables on acceptability were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis rank test (&#x003c7;2 value reported). </p><p>In Sv2, a total of 1223 responses were collected. Participants who identified themselves as totally opposed to livestock production (<italic>n</italic> = 222) and those who had some involvement with livestock production (farmer, professional, or student) (<italic>n</italic> = 233) were excluded from the analysis, resulting in a sample of 768 responses: surgical castration (<italic>n</italic> = 261), immunocastration (<italic>n</italic> = 260), raising entire males (<italic>n</italic> = 247). Consistency of the three first attitude questions (i.e., how much they approved the method, how they considered it acceptable and adequate) was assessed using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha; as the alpha coefficient was &#x0003e;0.93, these responses were averaged to create a mean for each participant for their &#x0201c;attitude&#x0201d; towards the method (surgical castration, immunocastration, or raising entire males). The effects of each of the socio-demographic questions (sex, age, education, urban/rural, region of the country, and income), perceived influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on answers, if they were aware of boar taint and that piglets are castrated, ownership of a castrated dog, and the three methods (i.e., surgical castration without pain control, immunocastration, and raising entire males) on attitudes were tested using generalized linear models. Post-hoc comparisons were performed using a Tukey HSD test. </p><p>For the descriptive analysis of acceptability of methods in both surveys, Likert responses to the question on acceptability were considered. Likert 1 and 2 were grouped as &#x02018;unacceptable&#x02019; and Likert 4 and 5 were grouped as &#x02018;acceptable&#x02019;, Likert 3 as &#x02018;neutral/does not know&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-animals-10-01826"><title>2.2.2.

This method allows identifying and interpreting patterns across the data and involves careful reading and rereading of the text for the development of codes and key themes. Thematic analyses of Sv1 and Sv2, respectively, were done by BV/MJH and RAG/MJH. In both cases, the pair ran the analyses together, comparing their results and discussing any discrepancies and ambiguities until agreement was reached. When responses bridged more than one theme, they were coded into multiple themes.

Participants argued that pigs should be castrated by the method that results in less pain and suffering for the animals, because it is ethical, results in better quality of the final product, or both.

Some participants discussed farm animal welfare as a public good, arguing that producers and consumers should not be responsible for paying this price increase and that the government should bear this cost.

Survey 2</title><p>Concerns with pigs&#x02019; pain and suffering, and arguments involving ethics and animal welfare were the two main justifications for support or rejection of methods proposed to deal with the problem of boar taint in pig meat. The pain and suffering of pigs, and ethical or animal welfare repercussions of surgical castration without pain control were the most discussed topics by participants that justified why they opposed this practice. Avoidance of pain and stress of surgical castration was the main justification for participants to support immunocastration or raising entire males. For some participants, the practice of surgical castration would be acceptable as long as it was done with pain control. Some argued that it is unethical that people involved in animal production cause pain to pigs to achieve production goals, given that they are the gatekeepers of these animals&#x02019; welfare and health. Others argued that consumers must adopt responsible meat consumption behaviors or demand that meat be produced without animal suffering. </p><p>Some participants supported surgical castration in pigs because of their experience with castration in pet animals. For these participants, given that this procedure is commonplace and acceptable for dogs and cats, there would be no reason why it would not be acceptable for pigs. Likewise, they said that just as anesthetics and painkillers are used for dogs and cats, there would be no justification for not treating pigs in the same way.</p><p>In contrast, arguments to support castration without pain control were the facts that surgical castration without pain control is a consolidated practice in pig production and the most favorable option for the producer, or the belief that young pigs do not feel pain in castration or that it is short-lived.</p><p>A few participants showed concerns about production losses due to raising entire animals and the organoleptic characteristics of the meat.

Discussion</title><p>Despite some methodological differences between the two surveys used in this study, a common finding was the rejection of surgical castration without pain control by over two thirds of the participants and greater acceptability of alternative methods. The reasons provided by participants in the two surveys to justify these attitudes were ethical concerns related to pain and suffering in animals, while acceptability of the alternative methods was influenced by concerns with potential exogenous residues or boar taint reducing meat quality, as well as the impact of the methods on animal welfare, naturalness, or production aspects. Increasing the price of pork reduced acceptability of both immunocastration and use of pain control. However, participants&#x02019; views regarding possible impacts of changes to improve pig welfare on price of pork varied. For some, avoiding pain justifies an increase in meat price, but others argued that this would be unfair, especially for lower-income citizens.</p><p>Pain and suffering was the main reason underlying low acceptability of surgical castration without pain control and support for the alternative methods. Participants also cited avoiding pain as a main priority in farm animal production. Likewise, animal welfare experts in the UK identified poor pain management as the most important animal welfare concern for pigs [<xref rid="B46-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A few participants argued that surgical castration was essential to guarantee productivity, a view most often shared by industry stakeholders, who consider some painful practices acceptable to maintain farm production systems [<xref rid="B25-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Yet, other studies support that pain caused by human intervention is one of the most important public concerns regarding animal production systems. For example, when asked to describe an ideal pig farm model, citizens without ties to the pig industry said that pigs must live without pain and suffering [<xref rid="B34-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. European citizens strongly oppose surgical castration without pain control [<xref rid="B47-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which has led Europe to discuss steps to gradually ban the practice [<xref rid="B3-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Our findings show that Brazilian citizens share these views, which should encourage the local industry to move to alternative methods. </p><p>For many participants in this study, pain control would be a solution for the problem. However, on-farm adoption of pain relief protocols is limited by scientific and technical uncertainties regarding their effectiveness [<xref rid="B7-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], farmers&#x02019; attitudes towards these tools [<xref rid="B23-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and legal restrictions to the use of these drugs by non-veterinarians [<xref rid="B49-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Discussing the issue of castration from an ethical perspective, Palmer et al. [<xref rid="B50-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] argued that, considering that the realistic alternative in pig production is surgical castration, immunocastration appears as the best immediate solution. This was the case for some participants in this study, who argued that immunocastration was the best alternative given that it is practical and effective and that raising entire males posed the risk of lower meat quality. </p><p>As shown in surveys with European citizens [<xref rid="B30-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B47-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] some participants considered immunocastration unacceptable based on the perception that the method is unnatural. Several studies have reported public concern about unnaturalness in pig production, as well as preference for systems with the least possible human interference [<xref rid="B30-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B34-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B51-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Citizens and consumers often refer to hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, transgenic components, and feed additives collectively as &#x0201c;chemicals&#x0201d; and link them with lack of naturalness in production systems, and with lower animal welfare and product quality [<xref rid="B35-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B51-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As shown in this study, Jansen et al. [<xref rid="B53-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] found that some people have negative attitudes towards chemicals in food and consider them unnatural and detrimental to health, and associate &#x0201c;chemical&#x0201d; with danger. Concern that immunocastration (and to a lesser extent, pain medications) would leave residues in the meat was also reported by participants, as shown by others [<xref rid="B47-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B54-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This was a reason stated by a few participants to support surgical castration without pain control. This concern may also explain why some participants explicitly expressed opposition to inflicting pain to animals, yet had negative attitudes towards castration with pain control or immunocastration. Although some studies indicated that consumers in Europe have positive attitudes towards immunocastration [<xref rid="B31-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B56-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], a widely reported limitation for adoption of this method is producers&#x02019; and industry stakeholders&#x02019; concern regarding consumer acceptance [<xref rid="B17-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B48-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Indeed, health and safety aspects are the animal production traits that consumers in different parts of the world perceive as most important when assessing alternatives to pig castration [<xref rid="B30-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B33-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B48-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B57-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Low awareness of pig castration issues, identified in both surveys, has also been reported in a previous study in Brazil [<xref rid="B33-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and in several European countries [<xref rid="B4-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B30-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B47-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B55-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B58-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We also identified low awareness of tail docking, adding to previous studies that found that Brazilians have low awareness of animal production practices in general [<xref rid="B33-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B59-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Expecting such low levels of awareness, we provided participants some information on why and how pigs are castrated, aiming to help people to evaluate the alternative methods in the context of commercial pig farming. However, it has been shown that simply informing lay citizens of the technical reasons behind practices that they may perceive as detrimental to animal welfare does not necessarily lead to support [<xref rid="B55-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B57-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B59-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B61-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

In the case of immunocastration, there is sufficient scientific knowledge demonstrating the absence of residues potentially harmful to humans (see [<xref rid="B18-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Nonetheless, some participants in both surveys expressed distrust in immunocastration despite the explanatory text explicitly mentioning the contrary, which may have some explanations. For example, the name of a technology influences public attitudes [<xref rid="B64-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], so the term immunocastration may have induced some people to think of controversies like vaccines or biotechnologies, adding to distrust. Additionally, it has been shown that interpreting risk messages is not straightforward, and lay understanding may not be in line with the intended scientific meaning [<xref rid="B53-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Lastly, part of the participants said that they did not trust most of the sources of information on animal production, which may be why some participants implied having low confidence in the information presented. A previous survey with Brazilian lay citizens reported complaints about misinformation and discontentment with information sources on transgenic crops, which caused distrust [<xref rid="B65-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Credibility and shared values with providers of information are two key factors influencing trust in information sources about new technologies [<xref rid="B66-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. As in other studies [<xref rid="B55-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B67-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], television and Internet were the sources of information about farm animal production most accessed by the participants. These sources bring negative news [<xref rid="B55-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B68-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] more often than information that may help citizens understand the basic elements of the discussion. Therefore, the public must be clearly informed, as by doing so trust is built, and trust is an important factor behind public acceptance [<xref rid="B69-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. </p><p>Even though pork is cheaper compared to beef, more than half of the participants in both surveys said that price was not an attribute to choose pork. Our findings suggest that some Brazilians would consider price increases to avoid painful procedures in pigs acceptable. However, given that Sv1 participants were recruited at an airport, these opinions are restricted to middle and upper-class participants. As these participants recognized, the price of meat is more relevant for lower-income citizens. Some participants implied that they viewed animal welfare as a public good, as suggested in the study of Lagerkvist and Hess [<xref rid="B70-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. For these participants, pig welfare must be improved, but not at the expense of the consumer. The scenarios presented to participants, of 10 and 30% increase in the price of pork, are unrealistically high, especially given that immunocastration is used in Brazil, with no direct impact on the price of pork for consumers. Yet, participants did not challenge the veracity of the price increases proposed, which may be explained by the low awareness of pig production systems. It is possible that participants assessed the price increase proposed in the survey based on the price of organic products in the region [<xref rid="B71-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Some Europeans may be willing to pay more for pig castration methods that take animal welfare into consideration [<xref rid="B30-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B54-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B72-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In contrast, one study showed that Brazilians&#x02019; views on pig production systems did not influence pork purchasing choices [<xref rid="B60-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The willingness to pay for meat produced in systems perceived as more &#x0201c;animal friendly&#x0201d; is poorly explored in Brazil. Considering that over 80% of the pork produced in Brazil is consumed in the domestic market [<xref rid="B38-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the issue warrants further investigation. Importantly, further studies must include the voice of lower income citizens, who may be more affected by increases in the price of meat resulting from animal welfare related changes in production systems and practices, as hinted by many participants. A fact to consider is that other changes in pig production practices that may impact on costs of production, like the transition of individual to group housing for gestation sows, are happening as a result of pressure from retailers, without direct consultation with consumers [<xref rid="B36-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Animal welfare and environmental impacts of meat production were not listed by most participants as reasons to choose meat, despite the relevance of these issues for livestock production [<xref rid="B28-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, meat-eating habits had some influence on acceptability of surgical castration and its alternatives. As shown in a Chilean study [<xref rid="B57-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], acceptability of surgical castration tended to be greater among participants that ate meat more frequently and those that considered meat more important. This finding is relevant because more than half of the participants in both samples rated eating meat as important, and over three quarters ate meat 3 to 7 days a week. These findings are consistent with a previous study in Brazil showing similar patterns [<xref rid="B63-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], as well as with the average meat consumption of the Brazilian population, of 99.8 kg per person per year (13.7 kg pork), which makes it one of the ten countries with the highest meat consumption in the world [<xref rid="B73-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Meat attachment and meat consumption habits are associated with moral disengagement regarding meat eating, i.e., the deactivation of moral self-regulation to reduce cognitive dissonance when considering the impacts of meat eating [<xref rid="B74-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This helps explain the apparent contradiction between the concern with animal welfare expressed by participants and the low importance assigned to this trait as a criterion for choosing meat. In contrast, participants cited tradition and organoleptic qualities among the most important attribute to choose pork, as shown by others [<xref rid="B31-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Altogether, these findings corroborate the conclusions of Macdiarmid et al. [<xref rid="B75-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], that public opinion around eating meat is associated with personal, social, and cultural values, and suggests that meat eating habits influence attitudes towards farm animal issues. Attitudes towards husbandry practices like castration may become increasingly negative over time, given the trends towards lower meat consumption, even in Brazil [<xref rid="B63-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. </p><p>Only few participants raised concerns that the practice of castration is a mutilation and therefore unnatural or cruel. It has been shown that acceptance of farm animal mutilations is low, but realizing an advantage from the practice and that it can be done in the absence of pain leads to greater support [<xref rid="B58-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Participants discussed the two aspects (need for the procedure and pain) to justify their attitudes towards the different methods. More than half of the participants in Sv2 had a castrated dog, confirming our assumption that many people have personal experience with the practice in pet animals. To avoid introducing a bias, this was the last question in the Sv2, and as a consequence, few people covered the issue in the open-ended question. Even so, some participants&#x02019; responses suggest that experience with castration in pets may contribute to castration of animals being somewhat normalized. A survey in the UK found that citizens were predominantly supportive of dog and cat neutering [<xref rid="B76-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Dog owners in The Netherlands said that correcting unwanted behaviors was an important reason to have their male dogs neutered [<xref rid="B77-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], supporting that perception of necessity may lead to support of the practice. In another study, Spanish consumers that were not aware that pigs are castrated said that it would not be a welfare issue if pigs were castrated in the same way domestic pets [<xref rid="B78-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], something that was also suggested by some participants in this study. In conclusion, experience with castration in pets may give people an opportunity to reflect about the pain and stress involved in the procedure, and may further contribute to their conclusion that causing pain to castrate animals is both unnecessary and avoidable. </p><p>This study was based on two convenience samples, and the results should not be considered representative on a regional or national scale. Participants&#x02019; sex was approximately equally distributed between the two samples and the demographics of the Brazilian population. Both samples contain a greater proportion of well-educated citizens, which is likely linked with citizens&#x02019; wealth; although this is not likely to influence people&#x02019;s values towards pain and suffering in animals, it may influence their perception of priority of animal welfare relative to other issues of food production. Participants in Sv2 were somewhat younger than in Sv1, and from all regions of the country, whereas Sv1 participants were from southern Brazil. Moreover, other limitations to the generalization of results of this study are the use of different recruitment methods (in person and online) and a 3-year gap between the two surveys, added to the unusual situation posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (e.g., confinement in the cities that had lockdowns, unemployment, sickness in the families or social groups). Only a few of the participants in Sv2 recognized that the pandemic might have influenced their responses or their views, but this may be because the survey was carried out in the early days of the pandemic. </p><p>The only demographic characteristic of participants that influenced attitudes towards piglets&#x02019; castration was sex, with women showing more negative attitudes towards surgical castration in both surveys, as shown in two previous studies [<xref rid="B33-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B57-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and adding to several others that have shown that women have greater concerns regarding farm animal welfare [<xref rid="B52-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. More than 25% of the participants in both samples reported growing up with some contact with farm animal production. In the online recruiting, it could be argued that this was caused by participants&#x02019; self-selection based-interest in the subject. However, Sv1 participants were randomly recruited in person in an airport, yielding similar result; additionally, in both cases, participants were not informed of the nature of the survey before they accepted to participate. This may in fact reflect the recent urbanization of Brazil, that changed from 45% people living in urban centers in 1960 to 85% in 2010 [<xref rid="B79-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><p>Our results, and previously published literature, indicate unequivocally that there is a need to end the practice of pig castration with methods that cause pain. It is important to note, though, that piglets&#x02019; castration is one procedure among a myriad of other production practices that challenge pig welfare [<xref rid="B80-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. To preserve its&#x02019; social license, the pig production sector needs to move beyond avoiding practices that cause pain and stress to animals, as current understanding is that farm animal welfare is more than just avoiding animal suffering [<xref rid="B82-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Thus, ending painful castration methods needs to be allied to changes that address public concerns, such as intensive feeding and housing practices and other painful procedures [<xref rid="B34-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B61-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B83-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Broader changes may be beneficial for pigs and also for production. For example, rearing pigs in lower stocking density and with environmental enrichment may be a requirement to raise pigs with tails and testicles [<xref rid="B19-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B84-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and would have further positive impact on pigs&#x02019; welfare [<xref rid="B85-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. A recent study showed that replacing surgical castration with immunocastration, avoiding tail docking, teeth clipping, and providing environmental enrichment to pigs resulted in lower physiological stress and risks for injuries and death, and improved growth with positive economic returns&#x02014;but not when these changes were made individually [<xref rid="B86-animals-10-01826" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Thus, changing one specific practice while maintaining others may incur in costs for producers without real benefits for the animals, and fail to meaningfully contribute to the social acceptability of the production system. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-animals-10-01826"><title>5. Conclusions and Recommendations</title><p>Participants in the two surveys were opposed to piglets&#x02019; surgical castration without pain control. The main reason for this position was the perception that the practice causes unnecessary pain and stress to animals and is therefore ethically unacceptable. The three alternatives presented in the study&#x02014;using pharmacological tools to control pain during and after castration, immunocastration, and raising entire males&#x02014;had more support than surgical castration without pain control. Considering that all the alternatives to replace the procedure are successfully used on farms in different parts of the world, the pig industry has no justification for not acting proactively. The choice of method to replace surgical castration and still produce pork of acceptable quality must fulfil the societal value of not causing pain and suffering to animals, as well as consumers&#x02019; demand for safe and high-quality products and, additionally, consider environmental, economic, production, and practical implications of each option. These factors may vary according to local farming culture, as well as regulatory, industry, and market requirements. For two reasons, immunocastration is a suitable method to replace surgical castration in Brazil. Firstly, farmers are increasingly adopting it for at least a decade, with positive results; secondly, using pain medications would require overcoming current cultural and regulatory limitations. Raising entire males is a new option for the Brazilian industry, and thus farmers&#x02019; and consumers&#x02019; attitudes should be further investigated, as this study suggests that there may be a potential niche market for its products. In summary, our findings indicate that the Brazilian public supports and prefers pig castration methods that do not cause pain to pigs; they also suggest that the concern with potential risks of presence of residues in meat, expressed by a few participants, may need to be addressed among consumers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful thank to Brazilian Airport Infrastructure Company (INFRAERO) for allowing us to take S1 in the Airport of Florian&#x000f3;polis, and citizens that voluntarily participated in the study.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-animals-10-01826"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/10/1826/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/10/1826/s1</uri>, Table S1: Script of the questionnaire survey 1 with the specific questions of the study and demographics, Table S2: Script of the questionnaire survey 2 with the specific questions of the study and demographics.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="animals-10-01826-s001"><media xlink:href="animals-10-01826-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, M.J.H. and M.C.Y.; Data curation, M.J.H. and M.C.Y.; Formal analysis, M.J.H., B.V., M.C.Y., R.A.-G. and R.E.W.; Funding acquisition, M.J.H.; Methodology, M.J.H.; Project administration, M.J.H.; Resources, M.J.H.; Supervision, M.J.H.; Validation, M.J.H., B.V., R.A.-G. and R.E.W.; Writing&#x02014;original draft, M.J.H.; Writing&#x02014;review &#x00026; editing, M.J.H., B.V., M.C.Y., R.A.-G. and R.E.W.

If the pigs are left intact (i.e., with their testicles), approximately 10 to 20% of the meat will express boar taint. Most consumers perceive the taste and odor as very unpleasant. In Brazil, to ensure that meat is not contaminated by boar taint, all male pigs must be castrated prior to slaughter (Decree 9133 of 2017).</p><p>The most commonly used technique in Brazil is surgical castration (removal of the testicles). Piglets are castrated between 3 and 10 days of age, usually by the farm staff. The use of medicines to relieve pain is not common in Brazil. </p><p>An alternative to surgical castration is called immunocastration. The piglets receive two injections with a substance that restricts the development of the testicles. The injection does not contain hormones, but it causes the pig to produce antibodies against its own reproductive hormones. The risk of boar taint in the pigs that have been immunocastrated is eliminated. The method is approved and adopted in several countries, including Brazil.&#x0201d;</p><p><bold>Sv2</bold> &#x0201c;In Brazil, pigs raised for meat production are slaughtered at around 6 months of age. At that age, entire males (i.e., with the testicles) can express boar taint in the meat. Some consumers perceive this taste and smell as very unpleasant. Boar taint is associated with the production of male hormones. To ensure that meat does not have boar taint, male pigs used in meat production are castrated. Without testicles, the production of the hormones responsible for the boar taint in the meat does not occur. Another reason for castration is to reduce aggressive behavior between animals during rearing. Castration results in calmer animals.</p><p>The most used castration technique in Brazilian commercial farms is surgical castration (removal of testicles). The piglets are castrated between 3 and 10 days of age. The use of medication to relieve pain during and after the procedure is not common.</p><p>Another method used in Brazilian commercial farms is immunocastration. In this case, the piglets receive two injections (in weeks 8 and 16 of life) with a substance that restricts the development of the testicles. The injection does not contain hormones and leaves no residues in the meat. It works by causing the pig to produce antibodies against its own hormones, which inhibits the development of testicles and the boar taint in the meat of the pigs so treated.</p><p>Lastly, it is possible to avoid castration and at the same time ensure that pigs do not develop the boar taint in the meat. To do this, entire (uncastrated) male pigs need to be slaughtered before the testicles develop and produce the hormones that lead to the boar taint. This may decrease the productivity of the farms a little, but eliminates the need for castration.&#x0201d;</p></boxed-text></app><app id="app3-animals-10-01826"><title>Appendix B</title><table-wrap id="animals-10-01826-t0A1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">animals-10-01826-t0A1_Table A1</object-id><label>Table A1</label><caption><p>Demographics of survey participants (Sv1, <italic>n</italic> = 441; Sv2, <italic>n</italic> = 768) and of the southern and general population, according to the latest Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics census (IBGE, 2011).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sv1 Participants (%)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IBGE* (%)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sv2 Participants (%)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IBGE* (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
