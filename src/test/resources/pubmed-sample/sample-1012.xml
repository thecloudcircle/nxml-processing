In full-term newborns, these bacteria are acquired from the mother during delivery and rapidly become the predominant organisms in the intestinal microbiota. Bifidobacteria contribute to the establishment of healthy intestinal ecology and can confer health benefits to their host. Consequently, there is growing interest in bifidobacteria, and various strains are currently used as probiotic components in functional food products. However, the probiotic effects have been reported to be strain-specific. There is thus a need to better understand the determinants of the observed benefits provided by these probiotics. Our objective was to compare three human <italic>B. longum </italic>isolates with the sequenced model strain <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 at the chromosome and proteome levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Pulsed field electrophoresis genotyping revealed genetic heterogeneity with low intraspecies strain relatedness among the four strains tested. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we analyzed qualitative differences in the cytosolic protein patterns. There were 45 spots that were present in some strains and absent in others. Spots were excised from the gels and subjected to peptide mass fingerprint analysis for identification. The 45 spots represented 37 proteins, most of which were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall or cell membrane synthesis. Notably, the protein patterns were correlated with differences in cell membrane properties like surface hydrophobicity and cell agglutination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results showed that proteomic analysis can be valuable for investigating differences in bifidobacterial species and may provide a better understanding of the diversity of bifidobacteria and their potential use as probiotics.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Bifidobacteria are anaerobic high G + C Gram-positive bacteria that belong to the <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>genus, which contains more than 30 species. <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>is a prevalent bacterial genus in the human colon that represents up to 90% of all bacteria in fecal samples of breast-fed infants and 3 to 5% of adult fecal microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In full-term breast-fed infants, the intestinal microbiota is rapidly dominated by bifidobacteria that are acquired from mothers' microbiota during birth. These bacteria contribute to the establishment of healthy intestinal ecology and can confer health benefits to their host. Indeed, impairment of bifidobacterial colonization is a risk factor for allergic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and for necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Consequently, bifidobacteria are the subject of growing interest due to their assumed contribution to the maintenance of gastrointestinal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For these reasons, some bifidobacterial strains are used as health-promoting or probiotic components in functional food products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although bifidobacteria have been reported to exert a number of positive biological effects, there has been limited research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. This may be due in part to reports that some of the positive biological activities of bifidobacteria are strain-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and to the limited number of sequenced genomes. Applying genomics to bifidobacteria is essential for a better understanding of their effects. Indeed, comparative genomic studies of the few sequenced genomes of bifidobacteria has contributed to a better understanding of the stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], bacterial phylogeny and ecological adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and genetic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Within the <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>genus, the first completed genome sequence was that of the probiotic strain <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705, which became available in 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and was revised in 2005 (GenBank database accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AE014295">AE014295</ext-link>). Recently, the assembled genome of <italic>B. longum </italic>DJO10A became available in the NCBI database (NCBI source NZ_AABM00000000), allowing this genetic information to be used for comparisons and functional analyses such as proteomic comparisons.</p><p>Unlike genome studies, investigations at the proteomic level provide insights into protein abundance and/or post-transcriptional modifications. Proteomic studies of the <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>genus have established reference maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; comparisons of differentially expressed proteins have shed light on bacterial adaptations to gastrointestinal tract factors such as bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and acidic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-electrophoresis) has been used to analyze bacterial protein polymorphisms and to distinguish between closely related pathogenic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], 2D-electrophoresis has not been used to compare bifidobacteria.</p><p>In this study, our objective was to compare three human <italic>B. longum </italic>isolates with the model sequenced strain <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 at the chromosome and proteome levels. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a high degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, the isolates showed different patterns in terms of their cytoplasmic proteins that may reveal correlations with specific phenotypic differences of the <italic>B. longum </italic>strains. Our results show that this approach is a valuable tool for exploring the natural diversity and the various capabilities of bifidobacteria strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we chose <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 as the reference strain because (i) <italic>B. longum </italic>is one of three species used as probiotics; (ii) the entire genome sequence is available, allowing protein identification using a public database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; (iii) a proteome reference map had been established for this strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Three <italic>B. longum </italic>human isolates with known biological effects were compared to this reference strain. In an animal model, <italic>B. longum </italic>BS89 has a protective role against necrotizing enterocolitis via a sharp decrease of clostridia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The two other isolates show differences in their abilities to stimulate the intestinal immune system in gnotobiotic mice by inducing either T-helper 2 (<italic>B. longum </italic>BS64) or T-helper 1 cytokines (<italic>B. longum </italic>BS49) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><sec><title>Genotype comparison using PFGE</title><p>We first compared the four strains at the genome level using PFGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. XbaI macro-restriction analysis of genomic DNA from <italic>B. longum </italic>strains NCC2705, BS49, BS64 and BS89 generated clear and easy-to-interpret PFGE patterns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The four strains exhibited a high degree of genomic heterogeneity and low intraspecies relatedness: BS89, BS49 and BS64 shared 57.9, 29.3 and 20.9% identity, respectively, with NCC2705 macrorestriction patterns. Such genetic variability is consistent with the comparative genomic analysis of <italic>B. longum </italic>strains NCC2705 and DJO10A, which showed substantial loss of genome regions, probably due to multiple phage insertion sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Considering the various biological effects and genomic heterogeneity of the isolates, one might speculate that this heterogeneity could be related to functional differences that could be identified using proteomic analysis.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of <italic>B. longum </italic>genomic DNA XbaI macrorestriction patterns using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotyping</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-10-29-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Comparison of cytosolic protein patterns of the <italic>B. longum </italic>strains</title><p>We next used 2D-electrophoresis to analyze the cytosolic protein content of these four strains. Spot differences between the three human isolates, BS89, BS49 and BS64, and <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2075 are summarized in Table S1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). A total of 45 spots (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), representing 37 different proteins, were present in some strains and absent in others. The 38 proteins fell mainly into the following functional categories: (i) metabolism-related proteins, especially proteins related to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; (ii) proteins involved in nucleotide or amino acid transport and metabolism; (iii) proteins involved in energy production and conversion; (iv) proteins related to transcription and translation. No Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) proteins, involved in cell control or cell division, showed differences among the four strains; these proteins are over-represented in <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This was not surprising because the bacteria were grown in a rich medium so that stress was minimal. In addition, the proteins in the bifidobacterial shunt pathway, which is a characteristic pathway of the <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>genus, were well conserved among all strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Differences in cell wall, membrane and envelope biogenesis proteins in the <italic>B. longum </italic>strains</title><p>Of the 38 identified proteins, nine were directly or indirectly linked to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Five proteins (BL0228, BL0229, BL1175, BL1245 and BL1267) were directly involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and include the following: dTDP-4-keto-L-rhamnose reductase/dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase (BL0228), a dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB1) (BL0229), a glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GlmS) (BL1175), a UDP-galactopyranose mutase (Glf) (BL1245) and a carboxyvinyltransferase (MurA) (BL1267). In addition, two of the identified proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, which is important for cell wall biogenesis: a &#x003b2;-galactosidase (LacZ) (BL0978) and a galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GalT) (BL1211). Finally, two spots corresponded to proteins indirectly linked to cell wall structure: cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthase (BL1672) and bile salt hydrolase (BSH) (BL0796).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of peptidoglycan and exopolysaccharide production. Proteins present or absent in the <italic>B. longum </italic>strains are indicated using <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 identification code</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-10-29-2"/></fig><p>Two of these proteins, BL0229 and BL0228, were detected only in the NCC2705 proteome pattern (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These proteins play a role in peptidoglycan biogenesis by producing rhamnose, a polysaccharide component of the <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Rhamnose is synthesized by a <italic>de novo </italic>biosynthetic pathway that starts with dTDP-glucose and leads to the formation of dTDP-L-rhamnose via dehydration and epimerase/reductase reactions mediated by RmlB1 dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase and BL0228 dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase/dTDP-4-keto-L-rhamnose reductase, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These two enzymes are encoded by genes belonging to the same operon, which is located just downstream of a gene coding for a hypothetical transmembrane protein that may be involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis (BL0230). Interestingly, glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase GlmS (BL1175) was detected in NCC2705 as well as in BS49. GlmS links the D-fructose-6-phosphate shunt of bifidobacteria to the early steps of the <italic>de novo </italic>amino acid sugar biosynthetic pathway, a pathway that is important for the synthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors.</p><p>The proteins MurA (BL1267) and Glf (BL1245) were not detected in the BS64 cytosolic proteome. Both proteins are involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. MurA is directly linked to the transformation of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine in that MurA catalyses the first committed step of its incorporation into the peptidoglycan (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Meanwhile, Glf catalyzes the ring contraction of UDP-galactopyranose to UDP-galactofuranose, which is then used to form the galactofuran structures that are incorporated into the peptidoglycan (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>The spot corresponding to &#x003b2;-galactosidase (<italic>lacZ</italic>, BL0978) was present in <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 and BS89, but not in strains <italic>B. longum </italic>BS49 and BS64. When grown on LB agar medium supplemented with X-gal, &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was observed not only in NCC2705 and BS89, but also in the BS49 strain (data not shown). This suggests that &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity might be repressed in BS64 and that BS49 may use an enzyme other than BL0978 to metabolize X-gal. The latter is consistent with the observation that several &#x003b2;-galactosidase-encoding genes are predicted in the <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 genome (BL1168 and BL0259). It is noteworthy that the &#x003b2;-galactosidase LacZ is a saccharolytic enzyme, explaining the adaptation of <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>to its ecological niche, e.g., digestion of complex carbohydrates that escape digestion in the human gastrointestinal tract. In fact, <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>&#x003b2;-galactosidases show transgalactosylation activity resulting in the production of galacto-oligosaccharides, which are considered prebiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The protein differences observed between the four strains may thus reflect different sugar utilization mechanisms that might confer different beneficial properties for the host in terms of probiotic and/or prebiotic activity.</p><p>The Leloir pathway enzyme GalT (BL1211) was observed in BS89 and BS49. This enzyme is involved in the UDP-glucose and galactose metabolism that links the anabolic pathway of carbohydrate synthesis to cell wall components and to exopolysaccharide synthesis; galactosides are frequently used as building blocks for exopolysaccharides. Indeed, UDP-galactose is one biosynthetic donor of the galactopyranosyl unit to the galactoconjugates that make up the surface constituents of bacteria, e.g., peptidoglycan (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthase (BL1672) was detected only in the NCC2705 strain. Interestingly, CFA synthase is directly linked to modifications in the bacterial membrane fatty acid composition that reduce membrane fluidity and helps cells adapt to their environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Proteins with changes in mobility</title><p>Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 12 spots, representing 6 proteins, showed changes in mobility due to charge changes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These proteins included a hypothetical protein of unknown function (BL1050), a probable UDP-galactopyranose mutase (Glf) (BL1245), elongation factor Ts (BL1504), a transcription elongation factor (NusA) (BL1615), an UDP-galactopyranose mutase (GalE) (BL1644) and the adenylosuccinate lyase (PurB, BL1800). All had pIs that clearly differed from corresponding proteins in <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705. In addition, four spots were identified as different isoforms of the BSH. However, the post-transcriptional modifications leading to the mobility differences are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological variability among <italic>B. longum </italic>strains</title><p>Among the 29 spots that differed (present/absent) between the NCC2705 and BS64 proteomes, only 11 proteins from BS64 had an orthologous gene in NCC2705. Comparison of the BS49 and BS89 proteomes to the NCC2705 proteome showed 23 and 26 differences, of which 22 and 14 proteins, respectively, could be identified by comparison to the NCC2705 genome database. Moreover, in BS64, missing spots were identified as enzymes directly or indirectly involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, as noted above. This suggested that BS64 and NCC2705 might show some biological differences in terms of the cell wall properties. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the surface hydrophobicity of the four strains and their ability to aggregate; these traits reflect the cell surface properties of the strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, BS64 showed three times more autoaggregation than NCC2705 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) and the surface hydrophobicity of BS64 was three times higher than that of NCC2705 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Because autoaggregation and surface hydrophobicity may impact intestinal colonization, these observations suggest that BS64 and NCC2705 may have different adhesion capabilities. It also suggests possible differences in peptidoglycan between the strains, since peptidolycan is the principal constituent of the bacterial outer membrane that directly contacts the surrounding environment. Adhesion of bifidobacteria to the gastrointestinal epithelium plays an important role in colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and provides a competitive advantage in the ecosystem against pathogens.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Aggregation (a) and cell surface hydrophobicity (b) of <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 (black circle), BS64 (black diamond), BS89 (black triangle) and BS49 (black square)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-10-29-3"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study used proteomics to analyze cytosolic proteins extracted from four strains of bifidobacteria grown in a rich laboratory medium. The results validated proteomics as a tool for exploring the natural diversity and biological effects of bifidobacteria. Specifically, proteomics allowed identification of phenotype differences in <italic>B. longum </italic>strains that have different in vitro properties. Interestingly, by comparing 2D-electrophoresis patterns and by identifying proteins that were present in some strains but not others, we found that the protein diversity observed between the strains was related to differences in cell wall/membrane biogenesis. In one of the strains (BS64), it was associated with better autoaggregation and greater surface hydrophobicity. This strain has been reported to be an inducer of T-helper 2 cytokines; in contrast, NCC2705 had the lowest surface hydrophobicity of the four strains and has been reported to induce T-helper 1 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Internal calibration was performed by using the trypsin peptides at 842.5 and 2211.1 Da. Spots mass accuracy varied between 15-30 ppm. The carbamidomethylation of cysteines, methionine oxidation and one miscleavage were considered during the search. A minimum of four matching peptides and a sequence coverage above 25% were required before considering this a result of the database search. Additional parameters were used to assume a correct identification: theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point in good agreement with experimental values.</p><p>Proteins were identified using MS-Fit software (University of California San Francisco Mass Spectrometry Facility; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prospector.ucsf.edu">http://prospector.ucsf.edu</ext-link> and Mascot software (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">http://www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>). The genome database entries of the chromosome of <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 (GenBank database accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AE014295">AE014295</ext-link>) were used to assign putative genes encoding the cytosolic proteins of interest from the four <italic>B. longum </italic>extracts using peptide mass fingerprinting. Based on comparison against the master gel, we identified spots that were not present in all strains, i.e. pattern differences. The presence or absence of a spot (protein) can reflect whether the gene encoding the protein is present, is expressed or repressed, or may reflect a change in the location of the spot on the gel. Our approach resulted in identification of spots (proteins) corresponding to genes in the NCC2705 genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Aggregation and cell surface hydrophobicity assays</title><p>The aggregation assay was performed using bacteria grown at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 hrs in TGYH broth that was harvested and resuspended in TGYH at an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.5.

To assay cell surface hydrophobicity, bacteria were grown in TGYH as described above, washed twice in 10 ml phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 50 mM) and diluted in the same buffer to OD<sub>600 </sub>= 1. This bacterial suspension (2 ml) was added to an equal volume of xylene and mixed for 2 min by vortexing. The OD<sub>600 </sub>was measured. Cell surface hydrophobicity (H) was calculated as follows: [(1-OD<sub>aqueous phase</sub>)/OD<sub>initial</sub>] &#x000d7; 100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JA performed the PFGE, proteomic and phenotype experiments.
