We investigated the consequences of experimentally-induced chronic neuroinflammation within the hippocampus and brainstem of young (4 mo) F-344 rats. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was infused continuously into the IV<sup>th</sup> ventricle for 2, 4 or 8 weeks. The number of MHC II immunoreactive microglia in the brain continued to increase throughout the infusion period. In contrast, performance in the Morris water maze was impaired after 4 weeks but recovered by 8 weeks. Likewise, a transient loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus was observed after 2 weeks, but returned to control levels by 4 weeks of continuous LPS infusion. These data suggest that direct activation of microglia is sufficient to drive, but not sustain, spatial memory impairment and a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase production in young rats. Our previous studies suggest that chronic neuroinflammation elevates extracellular glutamate and that this elevation underlies the spatial memory impairment. In the current study, increased levels of GLT1 and SNAP25 in the hippocampus corresponded with the resolution of performance deficit. Increased expression of SNAP25 is consistent with reduced glutamate release from axonal terminals while increased GLT1 is consistent with enhanced clearance of extracellular glutamate. These data demonstrate the capacity of the brain to compensate for the presence of chronic neuroinflammation, despite continued activation of microglia, through changes in the regulation of the glutamatergic system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer</kwd><kwd>Parkinson</kwd><kwd>Glutamate</kwd><kwd>Excitatory amino acid transporter</kwd><kwd>SNAP25</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Chronic neuroinflammation is now widely considered a risk factor for many age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Aberrant extracellular proteins such as &#x003b2;-amyloid and &#x003b1;-synuclein activate resident microglia and initiate neuroinflammation in AD and PD, respectively [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Activated microglia are detectable many years prior to the onset of characteristic neuropathological and symptomatic changes diagnostic for AD and PD and are found in brain regions that ultimately show significant neuropathology, the hippocampus and substantia nigra (SN), respectively, as demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET) studies [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The young adult brain appears to recover from exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli.</p><p id="P3">We have produced a pro-inflammatory environment in young male rats by infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the IV<sup>th</sup> ventricle, and have systematically documented a slowly evolving and region-specific series of changes induced by the chronic infusion of picomolar levels of LPS; these changes represent a complex interplay of glial and neuronal interactions leading to a series of compensatory changes that transpire in the presence of continued stimulation of microglia. After only two days of LPS infusion, activated microglia were seen diffusely scattered throughout the brain, suggesting that the LPS had spread throughout both cerebral hemispheres within a relatively short period of time [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. After 4 weeks of LPS infusion, the number of activated microglia gradually decreased in all regions with some key exceptions: the greatest inflammatory response was concentrated within the hippocampus [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The increased number of activated microglia correlated with a reduction in the number of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors within the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 hippocampal areas without evidence of neuronal loss [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], an impairment in spatial memory but not object recognition performance [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], impaired long-term potentiation [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the loss of layer II and III pyramidal cells in entorhinal cortex [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and elevated levels of mRNA for multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After four weeks of LPS infusion, MRI studies identified enlarged lateral ventricles with shrinkage of the temporal lobe regions [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Chronic infusion of LPS into the basal forebrain produced a selective decline in the number of neurons displaying choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactivity; the loss of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive cells was time-dependent but not dose-dependent [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These effects of LPS were reproduced by chronic infusion of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), which produced identical changes in the number of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons within the basal forebrain [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggest that LPS quickly initiates a cascade of biochemical processes that show time-dependent, region-specific and cell selective changes that progress during four weeks of LPS infusion [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The current study extended the duration of continuous LPS exposure to 8 weeks and investigated behavioral, cellular and molecular consequences of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and brainstem, regions that show a peculiar vulnerability to age-associated neurodegeneration [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Subjects and surgical procedures</title><p id="P4">110 young (4 mo) male F-344 rats (Harlan, Indianapolis., IN) survived throughout the entire surgical implantation, infusion and behavioral testing periods.

Four days of testing were conducted prior to sacrifice, 4 or 8 weeks after surgery according to Marchalant et al., [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Rats in the 2 week groups were not tested due to our concern that the effects of the surgery and LPS might interfere with performance. The pool (170 cm diameter with grey walls) was in the center of a room with multiple distal visual cues and a plastic board against the wall of the pool as a proximal visual cue. A hidden escape platform (10 cm diameter) was present in a constant location, submerged 2.5 cm below the water surface. The rats were tracked using Noldus Ethovision 3.1 tracking and analysis system (Noldus, Leesburg, VA). Initially, rats were placed on the hidden platform for 30 sec. Each rat then performed three training blocks per day of two trials per block (6 total trials per day) over 4 days that were initiated from one of seven locations varied randomly from trial to trial. After the rat found the escape platform or swam for a maximum of 60 sec, it was allowed to remain on the platform for 30 sec. A probe trial of 60 sec in which the escape platform was removed was conducted on the 4<sup>th</sup> day after the completion of 6 trials. Two visible platform trials were then conducted in which the platform was raised 2 cm above the surface of the water, marked with a latex glove and moved randomly. Latency to find the hidden platform, swim speed, time spent in the perimeter of the pool (thigmotaxis) and time spent within the region of the removed platform during the probe trial were analyzed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Histology</title><p id="P7">Following completion of behavioral testing, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and were transcardially perfused (10 ml/min) with cold saline (0.9%, 80 ml) containing heparin (1 U/ml), followed by paraformaldehyde (4% dissolved in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 120 ml).

For chromogenic staining, free-floating tissues were rinsed in PBS (0.01 M), quenched for endogenous peroxidase activity (50% methanol, 0.3% triton and 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), blocked with normal goat serum (5%), and incubated with primary antibody over one or two nights at 4&#x000b0;C. Thereafter, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 1.5 hr, rinsed, incubated for 1 hr with avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (ABC kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA), rinsed, and visualized by incubation with 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Vector, Burlingame, CA) as chromogen. Double-peroxidase stained sections were then placed into another primary antibody processed as described above and visualized with SG Blue (Vector, Burlingame, CA). After the final rinse, sections were mounted onto gel coated slides, rehydrated, counterstained with cresyl violet, dehydrated, coverslipped with cytoseal (Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) and examined using light microscopy. Fluorescent staining followed a similar initial procedure, however after the first rinse; tissues were mounted to gel-coated slides. Following incubation with primary antibody, tissues were incubated with avidin-biotin amplification system (Vector), incubated with secondary antibody then AB detection kit (Vector) and visualized using the TSA fluorescence system CY3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Emeryville, CA) with the nuclei counterstain DAPI.

Dopamine-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase (DBH), an enzyme that produces norepinephrine from dopamine, was evaluated as a reporter of projection strength of LC neurons (anti-DBH, 1:2000, rabbit polyclonal, AbCam). Synaptosome associated protein 25 (SNAP25) is involved in vesicle docking, and was evaluated using rabbit anti-SNAP25 (1:750, AbCam, Cambridge, MA). The glutamate transporter GLT1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2, EAAT2) was evaluated with guinea-pig anti-GLT1 (1:2000, Millipore). MHC II-immunoreactive (MHC II-IR) microglia were manually counted using MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Image Corp., West Chester, PA) in two representative hippocampal slices. SNAP25 and GLT1 were evaluated in two representative hippocampal slices per animal, with all tissues stained simultaneously and subjected to identical staining conditions, and then evaluated as staining density per area using Image J software (NIH) or Nikon Elements (Nikon, Melville, NY).

In the current study, infusion of LPS into the IV<sup>th</sup> ventricle induced microglial activation and MHC II expression in regions typically vulnerable to age-associated degenerative diseases such as the hippocampus, SN and LC, as well as impaired spatial memory and reduced TH expression in the SN and DBH expression in the hippocampus. The number of MHC II-IR microglia within the hippocampus and SN continued to increase as LPS-induced spatial memory deficit and reduced TH and DBH expression attenuated.</p><sec id="S16"><title>Chronic activation of microglia</title><p id="P27">LPS directly activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on microglia, eliciting the expression of MHC II on microglia scattered throughout the brain within only a few days [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Increasing numbers of microglia expressed MHC II over the 8 week LPS infusion period, suggesting an expanding and progressive activation of microglia upon exposure to LPS over time; although LPS is lipid soluble and widely dispersed, our results suggest not all microglia are activated simultaneously. In addition, within the first few days the hippocampus showed very few MHC II microglia; the density here gradually increased as it declined in other brain regions [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This pattern of activation in the presence of LPS may recapitulate an important aspect of the inflammatory process in the diseased brain characterized by activation of individual microglia and groups of microglia within specific brain regions over time due to the accumulation of aberrant protein, such as &#x003b2;-amyloid or &#x003b1;-synuclein, and presence of degenerating neurons in the microenvironment.</p><p id="P28">Activation of microglia by LPS is sufficient to drive spatial memory impairment and decline in TH expression that are not sustained by continued LPS infusion. This apparent disconnect between increased microglia MHC II expression and both attenuated deficits in water maze performance and TH expression is consistent with the hypothesis that MHC II is residually expressed on microglia that have converted from an &#x02018;active&#x02019; pro-inflammatory state, or classical M1, into an alternative activation state, called M2a [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Simply stated, MHC II is not an accurate indicator of the pro-inflammatory status of the resident microglia, thus its presence did not correlate with performance or changes in TH expression. Microglia chronically exposed to LPS for up to 8 weeks in our model will undoubtedly develop endotoxin tolerance [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and may residually express MHC II, but no longer maintain a pro-inflammatory profile. Thus, the presence of MHC II-IR microglia over time may only represent the accumulation of microglia that were initially activated by the LPS exposure but are no longer in an active pro-inflammatory state as well as newly activated populations of microglia. Endotoxin tolerance itself may be an important compensatory mechanism to protect the brain from the detrimental consequences of prolonged neuroinflammation [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We hypothesize that as additional microglia become activated at different time points throughout the 8 week infusion period, so too do microglia gradually become tolerant throughout that period. Therefore, a chronic neuroinflammatory environment is established not by microglia that remain active, but by the sequential activation of additional microglia over time. We speculate that the young brain compensates to a pro-inflammatory challenge via a complex regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission that protects neurons from injury; this compensatory process may become impaired during the normal or pathological aging subsequently predisposing the brain to neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Time-dependent attenuation of response to LPS in SN and LC</title><p id="P29">Continuous LPS infusion for up to eight weeks was characterized by an accumulation of microglia expressing MHC II within the DG and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and a significant impairment in hippocampal-sensitive spatial working memory after four weeks of infusion that was completely attenuated eight weeks after the initiation of the infusion. Likewise, infusion of LPS into the IV<sup>th</sup> ventricle increased the number of activated microglia within the SN and throughout the brainstem. The number of dopaminergic neurons in the SN expressing TH and pTH were reduced after 2 weeks of LPS infusion, but restored after 4 weeks. Similarly, the number of noradrenergic neurons in the LC expressing TH and the density of noradrenergic projections to the hippocampus distinguished by DBH expression were reduced after 2 weeks of LPS infusion and restored 4 weeks later. Decreased availability of the rate-limiting enzymes TH and DBH suggests reduced production of dopamine and norepinephrine. Diminished production of neurotransmitters or, &#x02018;luxury systems,&#x02019; may be a cellular defense strategy to divert energetic resources to survival mechanisms in a chronically stressful environment. Interestingly, reductions in TH and DBH driven by the immune response to LPS are not sustained over 4 and 8 weeks, though the inflammatory environment persisted or was elevated in the SN, LC and hippocampus. These data also suggest that the low-level chronic neuroinflammation produced by chronic infusion of LPS does not produce neuronal cell death; consistent with lack of observed neurodegeneration in previous studies of the hippocampus and temporal lobe region [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that the young brain compensates on a behavioral and cellular level to the chronic presence of neuroinflammation and continued activation of microglia.</p></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="background"><title>Compensation within the Hippocampus through Regulation of Glutamate</title><p id="P30">Within the hippocampus our results are consistent with the hypothesis that compensatory changes related to synaptic regulation of glutamate might underlie the recovery of spatial working memory in the continued presence of LPS and increased number of MHC II-IR microglia; therefore, we choose to pursue this mechanism further. We have previously documented the impact of glutamatergic dysregulation within the hippocampus following four weeks of LPS infusion. Rats demonstrated impaired accuracy of neural encoding, information processing and spatial memory that was restored by pharmacologically antagonizing glutamatergic-NMDA receptors with the partial uncompetitive antagonist memantine [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, a reduction of glutamate release by stimulation of endocannabinoid receptors or blockade of adenosine receptors by caffeine administration prevent LPS-induced microglia activation and spatial memory deficits [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The prevention of LPS-induced microglia activation and behavioral deficit by pharmacological reduction of glutamate activity suggests that neuroinflammation leads to aberrant glutamate activity. These pharmacological observations are complemented by evidence from the current study that naturally occurring changes in glutamate regulation, i.e. increased expression of SNAP25 and GLT1, occur as performance in the water maze task recovers.</p><p id="P31">SNAP25 is part of a large protein complex involved in release of neurotransmitter from vesicles and learning and memory. Decreased levels of SNAP25 expression have been described in disease states characterized by increased network excitability and possibly associated with neurotoxicity [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and in elderly individuals with Alzheimer&#x02019;s and Down syndrome who also Alzheimer&#x02019;s like pathology and cognitive impairment [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. SNAP25 did not decrease upon exposure to the neuroinflammatory environment created by chronic LPS infusion; however SNAP25 expression did progressively increase between 4 and 8 weeks of infusion, concurrent with the attenuation of behavioral impairment. One interpretation is that, during a time of recovery, increased SNAP25 in the glutamatergic terminals that abundantly populate the hippocampus may indicate decreased glutamate release; a property which may be beneficial against a background of inflammation-induced elevation of extracellular glutamate and is consistent with the beneficial profile of memantine which blocks activation of NMDARs by excessive extracellular glutamate but not synaptically evoked glutamate release [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Conversely, SNAP25 negatively regulates native voltagegated calcium channels in glutamatergic neurons at glutamatergic terminals [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], suggesting that increased SNAP25 above basal levels may lead to decreased depolarization and neurotransmitter release from the pre-synaptic terminal. Therefore the increased expression of SNAP25 in the current study may indicate decreased glutamate exocytosis from glutamatergic neurons, a restoration of hippocampal sparse encoding and recovered spatial memory similar to what we have previously described following administration of glutamatergic receptor channel antagonists [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p id="P32">An increase in extracellular glutamate may result from inflammation-induced alterations in the ability of astrocytes to sequester glutamate [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Astrocytes exhibit only partial endotoxin tolerance [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and effects of LPS upon glutamate uptake may be exacerbated by continued LPS infusion. GLT1 is the principle excitatory amino acid transporter responsible for approximately 80&#x02013;90% of glutamate clearance from the extracellular space in hippocampal tissue [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Reduction of glutamate transport and clearance as well as variants of the GLT1 gene have been associated with aging and AD [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. If reduced transport of glutamate by astrocytes in fact contributes to elevated glutamate levels, this may be due to a change in transporter activity, as we did not observe a decrease in GLT1 expression. However, increased expression of GLT1 was observed in the CA3 and DG of the hippocampus after 4 and 8 weeks of LPS infusion, and indicates that glutamate clearance may be enhanced. Increased glutamate clearance may compensate against the effects of chronic neuroinflammation and improve spatial memory by reducing synaptic &#x02018;noise&#x02019; from elevated extracellular glutamate. This interpretation is consistent with compensatory increase in glutamate clearance rate seen in aged rats after elevated evoked-glutamate release in middle age [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and a similar compensation seen in a genetic model of consistent-low level lifetime elevated glutamate release [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p id="P33">Compensatory increases in the SNAP25 protein that regulates glutamate release and GLT1 which sequesters glutamate into astrocytes are consistent with a previous finding that NMDARs after 4 weeks of LPS infusion [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; another compensatory change that would act to decrease responsiveness to elevated extracellular glutamate. Taken together, these data indicate that naturally occurring changes within the hippocampus that decrease the action of glutamate on the post-synaptic site and occur during the continued activation of microglia, represent a process of compensation against chronic neuroinflammation that proceeds and persists throughout behavioral recovery.</p><p id="P34">Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that compensatory changes related to synaptic regulation of glutamate might underlie the recovery of spatial working memory in the continued presence of LPS and increased number of MHC II-IR microglia. The unique mechanisms discovered in this study by which the young brain compensates against chronic exposure to an inflammatory environment, namely an increase of GLT1, shed light on the interaction between neuroinflammation, glutamatergic regulation and compensatory mechanisms that may prolong the period of health before the manifestation of pathology and clinical symptoms in neurodegenerative disease. Taken together, these data indicate that naturally occurring changes that decrease the action of glutamate within the hippocampus of the young adult brain in an environment of persistent, low-level neuroinflammation represent a process of compensation that proceeds and persists throughout behavioral recovery in the young brain. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that compensatory biochemical processes within the young brain are able to delay the clinical symptoms of degenerative diseases; with advanced age these processes may fail to provide the necessary compensation of function or respond positively to anti-inflammatory therapy [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, if we can pharmacologically drive an increase in glutamate clearance, we may be able to facilitate a compensatory response that would be sufficient to attenuate inflammation-induced cognitive impairment and potentially be efficacious against the manifestation of clinical symptoms of AD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><p>We thank to Dan Ankney and Katrina Paumier for stereology training.
