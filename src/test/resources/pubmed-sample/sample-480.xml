However, postoperative pain is still insufficiently treated with more than 50% of patients suffering from moderate to severe pain early after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One of the reasons for this unsatisfactory situation might be an underestimated role of risk factors for a poor postoperative pain outcome. Although increasingly studied, clinical relevance of most risk factors are not determined yet.</p><p>One factor increasing the risk to experience more severe pain after surgery is the (female) sex of the patient. Sex specific differences in pain in general are well described in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the situation for POP is not yet clear. In some studies women tended to report more pain both at rest and during movement after surgery compared to men, but this trend is not consistent throughout the literature [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Even more controversial is the effect of sex on opioid consumption and opioid-induced side effects after surgery. Although morphine seems to be more effective in women compared to men [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], clinical trials investigating sex differences of perioperative morphine consumption showed conflicting results [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178659.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>A recently published large database analysis demonstrated that sex&#x02014;apart from age and preoperative chronic pain&#x02014;is a possible risk factor for severe POP with a mean differenced of 0.23 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0&#x02013;10 between males and females [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the clinical relevance of this finding needs further examination mainly due to the small total difference and reporting of only one clinical outcome parameter (&#x0201c;worst pain intensity&#x0201d;), but not other pain-related outcomes including pain frequency, interference with activities and feelings, opioid consumption and perceptions of care. Furthermore, other factors such as age, preoperative pain or psychological factors likely affect the severity of acute postoperative pain. If these factors are independent risk factors or interact in any way&#x02013;e.g. with the risk factor sex&#x02013;is basically not knon yet. Together, clinical data focusing on the exact role of the risk factor &#x0201c;sex&#x0201d; for poor pain outcome after surgery, on confounding factors influencing sex as a risk factor and on the clinical relevance of sex as a rsik factor are currently limited [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The major aim of the present study was to investigate sex differences in POP outcome (beyond worst pain after surgery), the influence of possible confounding factors on sex differences and the clinical relevance of these results in additional descriptive subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The present study was conducted as part of the EU funded &#x0201e;Pain Out&#x0201d;project, an international multicenter benchmarking-project for the improvement of acute POP treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pain-out.eu/">http://www.pain-out.eu</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; Institutional Review Board approval for the whole project was given in Jena, Germany (2723-12/09) and for the project site in Muenster (University Hospital of Muenster) by the local ethic committee Muenster, Germany (2009-936-b-S). Data presented here were collected prospectively between March 2010 and June 2011&#x02014;exclusively in the University Hospital of Muenster, Germany, which is a specialist hospital for orthopedic surgery with several subspecialties providing supra-regional service for several orthopedic indications.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Data collection and definition of outcome data</title><p>Patient outcome data were collected using the validated international pain outcome (IPO) questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The IPO contains 13 questions which cover five areas of outcome measurement in POP&#x02013;pain intensity, interference of pain with activities and feelings, analgesic side-effects and the patient&#x02019;s impression of the care they received. The IPO questionnaire includes the following items: Least pain since surgery (numerical rating scale (NRS) 0&#x02013;10); Worst pain since surgery (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Percentage of time in severe pain (0&#x02013;100%); Pain interference with activities in bed (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Pain interference with activities out of bed (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Pain interference with breathing/coughing (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Pain interference with sleep (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Emotional impairment due to pain: anxious (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Emotional impairment due to pain: helpless (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Adverse effects: nausea (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Adverse effects: drowsiness (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Adverse effects: itching (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Adverse effects: dizziness (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Percentage of pain relief from all treatments combined (0&#x02013;100%); Participation in decision making (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Satisfaction with pain treatment (NRS 0&#x02013;10); Presence of a persistent painful condition for 3 months or more before the surgery (yes/no) including Intensity of the persistent pain before surgery (NRS 0&#x02013;10).</p><p>A research assistant screened patients on the orthopedic wards at the university clinic of Muenster one day after surgery and informed patients in written form as well as orally to get verbal agreements. Due to the observational nature of the study and its characteristic as a quality improvement project, written informed consent was&#x02013;at the time the study was performed&#x02014;not required (ethic committees of the University of Jena and University of M&#x000fc;nster). As defined by the Pain-Out Project, patients were included, if they were inpatients (&#x02265; 18 years), consented to participate in the project and able to fill out the questionnaire by themselves. Exclusion criteria were refusal to participate, undergone repeat surgery, cognitive impairments or language deficiencies. After inclusion, patients filled out the IPO and the research assistant collected demographic data (sex, age, weight, height, nationality, place of birth, language of participant), medical history data (e.g. preoperative chronic pain) and process data (e.g. type of operation according to ICD-9, anesthesia techniques, analgesia technique, analgesic consumption etc.) from the patients&#x02019; charts in standardized fashion according to the Pain Out protocol. All data were assessed on the first day after surgery. The collected data were anonymized and then entered into the Pain Out Registry using a web-based tool as described recently [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The primary outcome variable we used here to assess sex differences and confounders for sex differences was the intensity of worst pain since surgery (numeric rating scale (NRS) 0 = &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d;&#x02013; 10 = &#x0201c;worst pain possible&#x0201d;). As secondary outcome we investigated the time the patient spent in severe pain since surgery (NRS 0% = &#x0201c;never in severe pain&#x0201d;&#x02013; 100% = &#x0201c;always in severe pain&#x0201d;), functional disability due to pain (NRS 0 = &#x0201c;did not interfere&#x0201d;&#x02013; 10 = &#x0201c;completely interfered&#x0201d;), anxiety and helplessness caused by the pain (NRS 0 = &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d;&#x02013; 10 = &#x0201c;extremely&#x0201d;), cumulative opioid consumption since surgery calculated by conversion of opioid requirements into morphine equivalents (ME), the degree of pain relief through pain treatment (NRS: 0% = &#x0201c;no relief&#x0201d;&#x02013; 100% = &#x0201c;complete relief&#x0201d;), wish for more pain treatment (&#x0201c;yes or no&#x0201d;) and satisfaction with the results of pain treatment (NRS 0 = &#x0201c;extremely dissatisfied&#x0201d;&#x02013; 10 = &#x0201c;extremely satisfied&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Perioperative pain management</title><p>All patients were treated according to the German postoperative pain guidelines and the standard procedures in the University Hospital of Muenster. In general, patients without contraindication received a premedication with a benzodiazepine (e.g. midazolam) and a non-opioid analgesic (e.g. etoricoxib, paracetamol or metamizol). Patients with preoperative chronic pain continued taking their daily pain medication perioperatively. According to our standard operating procedure and in agreement with the orthopedic surgeons most surgery was carried out under general anesthesia (GA) alone or combined with a regional anesthetic (RA)&#x02014;as patient controlled analgesia (PCA) via a catheter (e.g. epidural) or single shot (e.g. interscalene nerve block). In a small number of cases patients underwent surgery with a RA (e.g. spinal anesthetic) alone. All patients receiving GA were treated intraoperatively with sufentanil or remifentanil and with prophylactic antiemetics (dexamethasone 4mg and/or ondansetron 4mg) according to the postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) score. Pain scores at rest and movement (NRS 0&#x02013;10) were assessed in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and on the ward. Most patients on the ward received a non-opioid at fixed time intervals. Pain triggers for rescue analgesia were NRS at rest &#x0003e; 3 or NRS at movement &#x0003e; 5. Patients without RA received an opioid on demand (e.g. immediate&#x02013;release hydromorphone).

Besides pain intensity, we also identified significant sex differences in pain frequency, pain interference with feelings and opioid consumption during the first 24 hours postoperatively. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrated that preoperative chronic pain and age are major confounders of sex related differences in worst POP since surgery and determined certain special subgroups (especially older women and women with preoperative chronic pain) as being more or less susceptible to experience high pain scores after surgery.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Sex differences in postoperative pain outcome</title><p>Several studies investigated sex as a possible predictor for worst POP intensity; however, results are sometimes not that strong and some studies even do not show sex differences [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An older qualitative systematic review summarizing the available literature concluded that sex seems not to be a consistent predictor for POP and analgesic consumption &#x0201c;as traditionally believed&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, more recently published data investigating procedure-specific risk factors for the development of severe POP strongly support a role of sex&#x02014;apart from preoperative chronic pain and age&#x02014;as one major predictor [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another recent large retrospective study confirmed this by showing a higher risk of females to report more severe pain events; however sex differences were somehow small with odds ratios between 1.14 and 1.16 [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that sex is as well a predictor for worst POP since surgery similar to those earlier clinical trials showing an effect on POP [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178659.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178659.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. New are our additional findings on clinical aspects related to pain, for example that women are significantly longer in severe pain after surgery. We suggest that this factor might be even more clinically important; a longer time in severe pain might compromise early mobilization and physical therapy. In addition, a longer time in severe pain during the early postoperative period contributes to the development of chronic postsurgical pain [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178659.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and might explain in part, why females are at higher risk to develop chronic POP compared to males [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in our study women received 25.8% more opioids compared to men during the first 24 hours after surgery. This result is consistent with some other clinical trials investigating sex differences in opioid consumption in the PACU [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178659.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, two meta-analyses investigating sex differences of opioid analgesia in patients receiving a patient controlled intravenous opioid analgesia for POP treatment reported a higher analgesic efficacy of morphine in women compared to men [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The latter difference might be explained by the fact that women might show an increased benefit from self-control of POP treatment, which is supported by higher anxiety and helplessness scores in woman compared to men in our study. Together, the results obtained here confirm earlier results from large real-life observations that older patients report lower postoperative pain [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with adding the new finding of decreased need for opioids in older men only.</p><p>Nevertheless, the observed sex differences in POP outcome were only small in our study. Furthermore, other analyzed pain related outcome variables (pain relief received, whish for more treatment and overall satisfaction with pain management) did not show any significant sex difference. This might indicate that the sex differences for the pain related outcome parameter, for example pain intensity ratings, are not that clinical relevant for females. For instance, females seem to be not really &#x0201c;affected&#x0201d; by their higher pain ratings (because satisfaction ratings and whish for more treatments were similar in males and females) suggesting that sex is not that relevant for the general aspect of POP. Furthermore, this might indicate that pain intensity is not the best (and only) outcome parameter relevant for a qualified pain management.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Confounder for sex differences in postoperative pain outcome</title><p>We demonstrate for the first time that age and preoperative chronic pain (but not &#x0201c;anesthetic technique&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;surgical procedure&#x0201d;) might be major confounders for sex differences. These findings possibly explain&#x02014;at least in part&#x02014;why sex alone has not been found consistently as a risk factor for POP in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The subgroup analysis focusing on the clinical relevance of this result revealed that the sex differences in pain intensity, impairment of pain interference with physical activities and anxiety scores were more pronounced in the older group of patients, in contrast to the younger age group where these results were not statistically significant. More specifically, older women received 62.5% more opioids compared to older men, but they reported an even lower amount of pain relief compared to men. This interesting finding might be explained by the fact that other factors, like psychological variables (anxiety and helplessness scores) and physical impairment, may have a greater influence on pain relief in older patients compared to the younger group. Recently it has been shown, that psychological variables, like anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and emotional illness representation are stronger predictors than age and other clinical variables for persistent postsurgical pain following hysterectomy [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, psychological support and specific interventions by the caregivers may help to improve pain management, especially in older women undergoing orthopedic surgery.</p><p>The results of another subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with preoperative chronic pain sex differences were significant. Women with preoperative chronic pain report significant higher worst pain scores since surgery, spend a significant longer time in severe pain, show higher helplessness scores and require significant higher amounts of opioids compared to men with preoperative pain. In addition, patients with preoperative chronic pain experienced higher postoperative pain intensity and frequency than patients without preoperative chronic pain. The latter finding might be the reason for sex differences in patients with preoperative chronic pain, because sex differences appear to be more pronounced when postoperative pain is poorly managed. This is supported by a recently published trial, which demonstrated that sex differences seem to be diminished in women and men treated with an epidural analgesia for major surgical procedures indicating that effective pain management is able to overcome sex related differences [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Women with preoperative pain might need more effective pain management than other patients. Future studies should investigate methods in order to improve the outcome in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Limitations</title><p>The results of this analysis are based on patient data of one single university hospital with an own standard of POP treatment, which might influence the generalization of our results. On the other hand, the single center data may have the strength by comparing a group of uniform treatments (similar surgeons, similar postoperative care and analgesic management, etc.). Patients analyzed within this database mostly were treated at least 24 hours after surgery within the hospital. Therefore, our results might not be transferable to outpatient surgery. We did not analyze the influence of preoperative opioid intake on POP outcome. However, it is well known that opioid na&#x000ef;ve patients might have a different sensitivity to opioids than opioid-dependent patients, which might have influenced the opioid consumption. This together with other factors related to preoperative pain needs further investigation in the future. Because the opioid consumption might be influenced by the sex of the prescribing physician [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178659.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], results focusing on opioid consumption might be influenced by this bias. However, our data were collected during daily routine. Therefore, this possible bias could not be controlled for needs to be investigated in the future. Additionally, due to lacking data we can not exclude that there were sex or age related differences in patients who had contraindications for the normal perioperative pain management treatment described within the methods. This might have influenced the results of the subgroup analysis. Treatment related confounders, although limited due to data collection within one single hospital and by applying standardized pain management protocols cannot be excluded as well. Furthermore, the present data only reflect the first 24 hours following surgery. Therefore, the calculated outcomes might be influenced directly by surgery or anesthesia and our results might be overestimated. However, it is well known from the literature that the first postoperative day represents the day with the highest pain scores during postoperative care and might be therefore the most important one even for sex differences [<xref rid="pone.0178659.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current prospective database analysis confirmed that female sex is a significant predictor for worst POP since surgery. Accordingly, significant sex differences were seen in other POP-related outcome parameters like time in severe pain, pain interference with feelings and opioid consumption. However, parameters like received pain relief or satisfaction were not significantly different in males and females indicating that higher pain scores in females do not result in disaffection and sex differences depend on the outcome parameter assessed. We further demonstrated that age and preoperative pain are predictors for worst POP since surgery as well as clinically relevant confounding factors for sex differences for worst POP. More specifically, subgroup analyses revealed that especially older women (&#x02265;50 years) and women with preoperative pain might be at higher risk for suffering from worse POP outcome. The latter findings might explain the conflicting results for sex being a predictor for POP in earlier studies. Apart from that, older women and women with preoperative pain probably require more clinical awareness during postoperative care by providing multimodal pain treatment including perioperative psychological support.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The results of this project were presented in part at the 14th World Congress on Pain (IASP) in Milan (08/12).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0178659.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Weiser</surname><given-names>TG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Regenbogen</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Haynes</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lipsitz</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
