These include an extraordinary stability to temperature and chemical denaturants and the tendency to form multimeric structures, an uncommon feature among SBPs involved in solute transport. Here we report a biophysical and structural characterization of the TmArgBP dimer. Our data indicate that the dimer of the protein is endowed with a remarkable stability since its full dissociation requires high temperature as well as SDS and urea at high concentrations. In order to elucidate the atomic level structural properties of this intriguing protein, we determined the crystallographic structures of the apo and the arginine-bound forms of TmArgBP using MAD and SAD methods, respectively. The comparison of the liganded and unliganded models demonstrates that TmArgBP tertiary structure undergoes a very large structural re-organization upon arginine binding. This transition follows the Venus Fly-trap mechanism, although the entity of the re-organization observed in TmArgBP is larger than that observed in homologous proteins. Intriguingly, TmArgBP dimerizes through the swapping of the C-terminal helix. This dimer is stabilized exclusively by the interactions established by the swapping helix. Therefore, the TmArgBP dimer combines a high level of stability and conformational freedom. The structure of the TmArgBP dimer represents an uncommon example of large tertiary structure variations amplified at quaternary structure level by domain swapping. Although the biological relevance of the dimer needs further assessments, molecular modelling suggests that the two TmArgBP subunits may simultaneously interact with two distinct ABC transporters. Moreover, the present protein structures provide some clues about the determinants of the extraordinary stability of the biomolecule. The availability of an accurate 3D model represents a powerful tool for the design of new TmArgBP suited for biotechnological applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Regione Campania and Progetto POR.

Despite the paradigm that associates protein sequences to well-defined 3-dimensional structures <xref rid="pone.0096560-Anfinsen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, it is commonly accepted that proteins are often endowed with repertoires of distinct structural states. Protein structural transitions play major roles in several biological processes, including protein-protein recognition, protein-ligand binding, and signalling.</p><p>The mechanism of small molecule transport across biological membranes represents one of the most striking examples that highlights the role of protein flexibility in cellular processes. This transport is generally carried out by intricate systems in which dynamical events are essential for the transfer of information from one protein component to the other. Prototypical examples in this context are represented by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) systems that play a fundamental role in the import of essential nutrients and in the export of toxic molecules in bacteria <xref rid="pone.0096560-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Canonical ABC cassette systems share a common structural organization comprised of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the translocation pore and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that hydrolyze ATP. The action of these systems generally depends on the presence of extra-cytoplasmic ancillary proteins, denoted as substrate binding proteins (SBPs), which recognize substrates with high affinity and deliver them to the TMD domains <xref rid="pone.0096560-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Interestingly, the structural characterization of the proteins involved in this process has revealed that these intricate molecular machines use complex dynamic mechanisms to fulfil their functions <xref rid="pone.0096560-Bulut1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Indeed, SBPs undergo large structural rearrangement upon substrate binding according to the so-called Venus fly-trap mechanism <xref rid="pone.0096560-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The interaction of the substrate-bound form of SBPs with the periplasmic peptide regions of the TMDs of the cognate ABC transporter, initiates the transport process. Although the atomic details of this cascade of events are not fully understood, it is commonly accepted that the entire process relies on large conformational transitions of both TMD and NBD moieties of the ABC systems.</p><p>The ability of SBPs associated with the ABC transport machinery to bind a variety of different ligands and their intrinsic structural versatility have made them very attractive systems for the development of platforms based on fluorescent protein biosensors for many naturally-occurring ligands. Indeed, by <italic>ad hoc</italic> re-engineering of their binding pockets it is possible to generate proteins able to recognize specific analytes for which sensors are eagerly needed.</p><p>As ideal biosensors are expected to have remarkable stability, we turned our attention to proteins isolated from thermophilic organisms. We identified the arginine binding protein form <italic>Thermatoga maritima</italic> (TmArgBP) as an ideal system for arginine detection <xref rid="pone.0096560-Ausili1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Deacon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Scire1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Luchansky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Ausili2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Arginine sensing is extremely important since argininemia is a debilitating inherited condition, characterized by a gradual accumulation of arginine and ammonia in the blood, whose diagnosis is crucial for effective medical intervention <xref rid="pone.0096560-Deignan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The biochemical and biophysical characterization of the protein has shown that TmArgBP presents a number of remarkable properties. These include an extraordinary stability to both temperature and chemical denaturants <xref rid="pone.0096560-Luchansky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Additionally, in contrast to the vast majority of SBP that operate as monomers, TmArgBP forms multimeric assemblies at room temperature <xref rid="pone.0096560-Deacon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Luchansky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>In order to elucidate the atomic level structural properties of this intriguing protein, we determined the crystallographic structures of both the apo and the arginine-bound forms of the protein. The analysis of these structures reveals some unexpected features and provides a solid structural framework for interpreting the biochemical and biophysical properties of the protein. The availability of accurate three-dimensional models for the different states of the protein strongly facilitates the design of variants that can act as durable and highly specific sensors for arginine.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Detection and stability of TmArgBP dimer in solution</title><p>TmArgBP is comprised of 246 amino acid residues, including a periplasmic signal localization peptide at its N-terminus.

Although aggregates with higher molecular masses were detected, we focused our attention on the main component. The analysis of this component by light scattering provided a weight-average molar mass of 50.3&#x000b1;0.2 and 49.6&#x000b1;0.1 kDa, for HoloTmArgBP and ApoTmArgBP, respectively. Taking into account the theoretical mass of the TmArgBP monomer (25267 Da), these data clearly indicate a dimeric organization of both the apo and the holo forms in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We also observed that this dimer does not undergo dissociation or further aggregation with time.</p><fig id="pone-0096560-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0096560.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Analytical SEC-MALS of TmArgBP.</title><p>The black and grey curves represent the Rayleigh ratio (left scale) of HoloTmArgBP and ApoTmArgBP, respectively; both are plotted against the retention time.

In order to gain further insights into the stability of the TmArgBP dimer, the protein was heated in the presence denaturants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In particular, SDS-PAGE (15%) was performed after heating the protein at 100&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes and indicates the coexistence of the dimeric/monomeric forms for both ApoTmArgBP and HoloTmArgBP. Interestingly, the dimer is fully dissociated only with the addition of urea at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g003">Figure 3B, C</xref>). However, the dissociation of the dimer is reversible, since this form can be restored upon urea dilution (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the dimeric organization of TmArgBP is endowed with a remarkable stability, which is independent of the binding state of the protein.

An analysis of the intermolecular contacts established by ApoTmArgBP molecules within the crystals, carried out by using the server PISA, clearly indicates that the these two independent molecules constitute a stable dimer. Indeed, the total buried area in the complex is 1387 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. This finding fully agrees with the characterization of the ApoTmArgBP oligomeric state in solution (see above).

The two lobes are connected by two distinct segments (residues 111&#x02013;115 and 204&#x02013;209), a characteristics typical of class II SBPs <xref rid="pone.0096560-Berntsson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In ApoTmArgBP, the two connecting segments form a short two-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet, which is stabilized by three main chain hydrogen bonds. In line with unliganded SBPs, the two lobes of the proteins are far away from each other and do not establish significant non-covalent interactions.</p><p>The analysis of the protein N- and C-termini unveils interesting and unexpected features. The very N-terminal residues of the construct used in the present study (residues 20&#x02013;27) form a stable &#x003b1;-helix. This suggests that the transmembrane helical region (residues 4&#x02013;21) extends in the periplasm maintaining its structure. The limited number of contacts of this helix with the rest of the protein suggests that this region is free to adopt alternative states upon the anchoring of the signal peptide to the membrane. The analysis of the C-terminus indicates that TmArgBP dimerization is caused by its 3D domain swapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, the two subunits in the dimer mutually exchange their C-terminal helix (residues 237&#x02013;246). An important role in the swapping process is played by the hinge region 232-KKSPY-236 whose extended conformation hampers the association of the terminal helix with its own subunit and favors its anchoring the main body of the other polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). A comparison of the local sequence of the hinge region with those of other arginine binding proteins with known 3D structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g001">Figure 1</xref>) suggests that it is more conformationally restrained in TmArgBP. Indeed, the hinge region of TmArgBP presents a deletion that shortens the loop length, which is associated with the concomitant presence of a Pro residue. It is reasonable to assume that this specific motif is responsible for the domain swapping observed in TmArgBP.</p><fig id="pone-0096560-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0096560.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Domain-swapped dimer of ApoTmArgBP.</title><p>(A) Cartoon representation of ApoTmArgBP swapping dimer.

The C-interface (closed interface) is the contact area formed by the swapping fragment with the main body of the other chain. This is expected to be present in the non-swapping monomer of the same or similar monomeric proteins. On the other hand, the O-interface (open interface) exclusively occurs in a 3D domain-swapped dimer and is not present in the closed monomeric form. In this framework, the C-interface of the ApoTmArgBP dimer reproduces the contacts between the C-terminal helix and the rest of the protein. This interface is stabilized by a strong salt bridge formed by the side chains of Asp56 of chain A with Lys242 of chain B (and <italic>viceversa</italic>). A weaker electrostatic interaction is formed by the side chains of Lys193 of one chain and Glu241 of the other chain. In addition, a number of hydrophobic interactions are detected at the C-interface. In particular, close contacts are established by the side chains of Tyr236, Trp243, Phe244, Leu239 and Ile240 from the C-terminal helix of one monomer with a concave cavity of the adjacent monomer, formed by Phe53, Leu57, and Phe112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). On the other hand, only sporadic interactions are detected at the O-interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast to the majority of assemblies characterized by domain swapping, the main bodies of the two subunits do not form any specific interaction. The only new interactions formed upon the formation of the swapped dimer are those involving the hinge peptide. A strong hydrogen bond between the two subunits is formed by the N main chain atom of Tyr236 of one chain with the oxygen atom of Leu231 of the other chain (and <italic>viceversa</italic>). In addition, the OH atom Tyr236 of the hinge region forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen atom of Tyr111. Therefore, the swapping dimer is essentially stabilized by interactions formed at the C-interface. Finally, it is worth noting that the two independent molecules of ApoTmArgBP display significant differences at the level of tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

These interactions cage the arginine ligand by tightly anchoring both its backbone and the side chain, thus making it fully solvent inaccessible.

The aliphatic portion of arginine side chain is sandwiched between the two aromatic rings of Phe38 and Phe76, whereas the guanidine group is involved in salt bridges with Asp37 and Glu42, as well as hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Gln142 and with Ser131 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

The secondary structural elements and protein organization in distinct subdomains (lobes) connected by two joining fragments confirm that TmArgBP is a type II SBP. In addition, the length of these joining regions classifies TmArgBP among cluster F according to the definition proposed by Poolman and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0096560-Berntsson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The tertiary structure closure associated with the arginine binding is well described by the Venus Fly-trap mechanism observed for other SBPs <xref rid="pone.0096560-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Berntsson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The comparison of the apo and the holo forms of TmArgBP shows that the structural re-organization upon substrate binding is associated with a domain movement as large as 80&#x000b0;.</p><p>One novel element emerged from the present study is that the protein forms a dimer through the swapping of the C-terminal helix. This dimer is characterized by rather loose quaternary structure organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g006">6</xref>). Indeed, the two subunits are essentially held together by interactions formed by the swapping C-terminal helices. In contrast, the main bodies (residues 20&#x02013;233) of the two chains do not establish significant interactions. This feature suggests that both the apo and the holo forms are endowed with a remarkable flexibility at the quaternary level. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out on the swapping dimers of RNase A have clearly indicated that interactions formed by the main bodies of the proteins play a crucial role in dictating the overall flexibility of these assemblies <xref rid="pone.0096560-Merlino1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Indeed, the RNase A C-terminal swapping dimer, which presents a loose interface <xref rid="pone.0096560-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, is highly flexible <xref rid="pone.0096560-Merlino1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> whereas the N-terminal swapping dimer presents a tight association of the two subunits and is rather rigid <xref rid="pone.0096560-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Merlino2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this scenario, it is likely that the dynamic behavior of both ApoTmArgBP and HoloTmArgBP resembles the one observed for RNase A C-terminal swapping dimer. It is important to note that solution studies presented here clearly show that the peculiar stability of TmArgBP is not confined to the individual subunits of the protein but also extends to the oligomeric association. Therefore, domain swapping confers TmArgBP a combination of plasticity and stability that is not achievable in canonical (non-swapped) dimeric associations. Moreover, the preservation of the swapping in both the apo and the holo forms makes TmArgBP structure an unusual example of the preservation of domain swapping despite giant variations of the tertiary structure. It is interesting to note that TakP, a unrelated SBP from a TRAP transporter, also dimerizes through the swapping of the C-terminal helix <xref rid="pone.0096560-Gonin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In this case, however, tertiary structure variations associated with ligand binding are very limited. The oligomerization through domain swapping exhibited by TmArgBP also provides a rationale for the observed ability of the protein to form higher aggregates <xref rid="pone.0096560-Deacon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Luchansky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These states may be achieved through a mutual swapping of the C-terminal helix that is not limited to two subunits but involves three (trimers) or four (tetramers) protein molecules, as found in RNase A <xref rid="pone.0096560-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Nenci1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Gotte1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The observation that TmArgBP dimerizes through the exchange of the C-terminal helix leads us to question the sequence determinants of swapping.

The analysis of TmArgBP hinge sequence shows the occurrence of a deletion that is concomitant with the presence of a Pro residue (Pro236). This feature is not found in other ArgBPs with a known 3D structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g001">Figure 1</xref>). An analysis of protein sequences indicates that TmArgBP shares a similar hinge sequence only with very close homologs. Indeed, the most distant protein (NCBI Reference Sequence YP_001305722) that presents the same deletion and the Pro residue in the hinge peptide show a sequence identity with TmArgBP of 60%. In evolutionary terms, this may suggest that the propensity of this protein to dimerize through domain swapping is a recently acquired property.</p><p>It is well know that the vast majority of SBPs operate as monomers as only sporadic examples of dimeric SBPs <xref rid="pone.0096560-Berntsson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, essentially related to TRAP receptors, have been reported <xref rid="pone.0096560-Gonin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Cuneo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, . In this scenario, the observation that TmArgBP is able to form a stable dimer leads to question about the relevance of the oligomeric state of TmArgBP on its biological function. We checked whether the two subunits of the TmArgBP dimer could simultaneously bind the ABC cassette system. The interactions of TmArgBP with an ABC transporter was modeled by following the procedure adopted by Vahedi-Faridi et al. <xref rid="pone.0096560-VahediFaridi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> for ArtJ and using the complex between molybdate/tungstate ABC transporter and its cognate SBP <xref rid="pone.0096560-Hollenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> as a model template. The overall shape of this speculative complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096560-g009">Figure 9</xref>) is compatible with the simultaneous binding of TmArgBP swapping dimer with two independent ABC transporter modules. The analysis of this complex also provides some preliminary indications on regions of TmArgBP involved in the transporter recognition. Based on analogy with ArtJ, there are two main regions comprised of residues 42&#x02013;51 in lobe I and residues 171&#x02013;177 in lobe II that play a major role in this process. Of particular interest is the observation that Glu163 of ArtJ, which was found by mutagenesis analyses to be a key player in this recognition process <xref rid="pone.0096560-VahediFaridi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, is conserved in TmArgBP (Glu171).</p><fig id="pone-0096560-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0096560.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>A model for ABC cassette bound to HoloTmArgBP swapping dimer.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0096560.g009"/></fig><p>The availability of the 3D model of TmArgBP also offers the possibility to relate the extraordinary thermostability of the protein to specific features of its structure. We compared sequence and structural features of TmArgBP with arginine binding proteins isolated from mesophilic organisms with known 3D structures. In particular, we selected the arginine binding proteins AbpA isolated from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (PDB code 4I62) and STM4351 isolated from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (PDB code 2Y7I) <xref rid="pone.0096560-Stamp1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It is commonly accepted that electrostatic interactions frequently play a major role in protein structure stabilization <xref rid="pone.0096560-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In this framework, we initially considered the overall content of polar versus charged amino acids, since it has been shown that in thermostable proteins there is an accumulation of charged residues associated with a reduction of polar residues <xref rid="pone.0096560-Cambillau1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Makhatadze1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Our analysis indicate that TmArgBP contains a higher percentage (30.8% vs 25.2%) of charged residues (Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp) and a lower amount (14.5% vs 21.0%) of polar residues (Asn, Ser, Gln, and Thr) when compared to STM4351. This trend is less clear in the comparison with AbpA, as TmArgBP maintains a lower amount of polar residues (14.5% vs 21.8%), but with similar percentages of charged residues (30.8% vs 29.5%). This analysis agrees with studies carried out on other hypertermophilic enzymes, that also exhibit a remarkable thermostability <xref rid="pone.0096560-Cambillau1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Makhatadze1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We next evaluated the occurrence and the frequency of specific interactions between charged residues that are commonly shown to play a role in the thermal stabilization of protein structure. In particular, our analysis found the occurrence of a larger number of salt bridges in TmArgBP (11 bridges) compared to STM4351 (5 bridges) and AbpA (8 bridges). These observations indicate that electrostatic interactions likely play a significant role in the stabilization of the protein.</p><p>This study also elucidates the molecular recognition mechanism of TmArgBP for arginine at atomic level. The protein binds the substrate through an intricate network of interactions, which results in a high affinity of binding at room temperature (K<sub>D</sub> in the nanomolar range). Although this may appear in contrast with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0096560-Deacon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the analysis of the 3D structure reconciles all data. Indeed, SPR experiments indicated a much lower affinity (K<sub>D</sub> of 17 &#x000b5;M) of the protein for a rather complex arginine-containing peptide <xref rid="pone.0096560-Luchansky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The lower affinity for this peptide can be easily explained by considering that the protein strongly grasps both charged amino and carboxyl ends of the aminoacid. Very recently, it has been reported that mutations of residues of the TmArgBP binding pocket, that were specifically designed to achieve a fluorescence variation upon substrate binding, lead to variants that bind arginine with micromolar affinities <xref rid="pone.0096560-Deacon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The analysis of TmArgBP binding pocket suggests that the replacements of Gly94, Met95, Gln116, and Thr146 with a bulkier Trp strongly reduces the affinity for the substrate through a partial occupation of the binding site or by inducing a local destabilization of the structure (Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096560.s001">File S1</xref>).</p><p>Taken together our data represent a significant advancement for the design and the characterization of TmArgBP mutants that may be used for constructing arginine sensors. It is worth mentioning that the use of the wild-type protein is not suited for this purpose since no variation of Trp florescence is observed upon arginine binding. Consistently, the local environment of Trp243 does not change in the structures of the apo and the holo forms here described, despite the huge structural rearrangements of the protein structure upon arginine binding. In both cases, this residue is buried by the interactions established by the swapped C-terminal region with the main body of the protein. The availability of an accurate 3D model is a powerful tool for the design of new TmArgBP variants, by fine-tuning substrate affinity and fluorescence signal, that are better suited for biotechnological applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Protein sample preparation</title><p>The wild-type protein used in these studies includes the residues 20&#x02013;246 of the protein sequence (UniProt code Q9WZ62).

All solutions were degassed by stirring under vacuum before use. In these experiments, 18 consecutive injections of 2 &#x000b5;L aliquots of a 1.25 mM arginine solution were added to the calorimeter cell (0.280 mL) containing 0.05 mM of apoTmArgBP<sub>20&#x02013;246</sub> at intervals of 150 seconds. To minimize the contribution of heat of dilution to the measured heat change, protein and ligand solutions were prepared in the same buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8). In order to ensure proper mixing after each injection, a constant stirring speed of 1000 rpm was maintained during the experiment.

The Se-Met derivative of TmArgBP was expressed by using <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta(DE3)2 cells in 1L of minimal media (M9) enriched with the following components: 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 ugL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ampicillin, 33 ug L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> chloramphenicol, 100 ugL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> thiamine at 37&#x000b0;C.

The molecular mass of the purified protein was checked by mass spectrometry and no proteolysis of the protein was detected. The ligand-free form of TmArgBP was prepared using procedures previously reported <xref rid="pone.0096560-Ruggiero1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Crystallization of both ligand-bound and ligand-free SeMet TmArgBP was performed at 293 K by hanging-drop vapour-diffusion methods.

However, a further screening/optimization of crystallisation conditions was achieved for the Se-Met derivatives of both HoloTmArgBP and ApoTmArgBP, using the PEG/Ion screen (Hampton Research) and then the Additive screen (Additive Formulation, Hampton Research). New crystallization conditions were found for both forms. The best crystals of HoloTmArgBP were obtained using a protein concentration of 25 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 0.2 M Potassium acetate, 20% (w/v) Polyethylene glycol 3,350 using LDAO as an additive <xref rid="pone.0096560-Ruggiero1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

Cryoprotection of the crystals was achieved by a fast soaking in a solution containing ethylene glycol to a final concentration of 14% (v/v). Because of a large unit cell, the diffraction data of HoloTmArgBP were collected using a small rotation angle of 0.1&#x000b0;. To avoid the overlap of diffracted intensities for HoloTmArgBP the resolution of the collected dataset was limited at 2.49 &#x000c5;, although spots were detectable at resolution as high as 2.0 &#x000c5;.

Manual modelling was performed using Coot <xref rid="pone.0096560-Emsley1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Crystallographic refinement of both structures was carried out against 95% of the measured data using the ccp4i program suite. The remaining 5% of the observed data, which was randomly selected, was used in R<sub>free</sub> calculations to monitor the progress of refinement. Non crystallographic restraints were applied in REFMAC <xref rid="pone.0096560-Winn1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> with medium restraints for main-chain atoms and loose restraints for side-chain atoms. Water molecules were incorporated into the structure in several rounds of successive refinement. For the apo form the entire construct sequence (residues 20&#x02013;246) was modelled in the final electron density. Due to the lower resolution of data, the two C-terminal residues could be not modelled for the holo form. The basic stereochemistry of the model was checked by using the program PROCHECK. We evaluated the occurrence of some correlations between geometrical parameters that are typically detected in highly accurate protein structures and are not biased by restraints in the crystallographic refinement. In particular, we checked the dependence on the &#x003c8; angle (i) of the NC<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>C bond angle <xref rid="pone.0096560-Karplus1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Esposito1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, (ii) of peptide bond planarity <xref rid="pone.0096560-Esposito2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and (iii) of the carbon carbonyl pyramidalization &#x003d1;c <xref rid="pone.0096560-Karplus1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Esposito1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096560-Esposito3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> (Figures S1&#x02013;S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096560.s001">File S1</xref>). For the high resolution apo structure, the NC<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>C/&#x003c8; and the peptide planarity versus &#x003c8; correlations are clearly detected. Surprisingly, the dependence of the peptide planarity on the &#x003c8; angle was also detected in the structure of the holo form despite the relatively low resolution of the dataset. This observation may be explained by considering that the crystals of the holo form diffracted at a resolution beyond the resolution limit of the dataset and that the large unit cell prevented the collection at higher resolution (see above). The structures of the HoloTmArgBP and ApoTmArgBP have been deposited in the PDB with the codes 4PSH and 4PRS, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Notation</title><p>Throughout the text, the residue numbering refers to the full-length protein 1&#x02013;246.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096560.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>Contains the following files: <bold>Figure S1.</bold> Distribution of NC&#x003b1;C angles in residues located in &#x003b2;-sheets (A) and &#x003b1;-helices (B) of ApoTmArgBP.
