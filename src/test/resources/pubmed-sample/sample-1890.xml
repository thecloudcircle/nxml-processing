Fine hydrophobic hairs on the abdomen (opisthosoma) hold a thin layer of air (a plastron) which enables the spider to breathe with its book lungs and tracheal system under water. In contrast to other spiders which hunt in an aquatic environment, this mainly nocturnal species is unique in spending its whole life under water. This is achieved by the use of a special web which is formed into a diving bell, the spider&#x02019;s centre for rest and reproduction. By means of its plastron, the spider transports air from the water surface to a submersed horizontal sheet-web, thus forming and filling the bell (Braun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1931</xref>Wesenberg-Lund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1939</xref>Crome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1951</xref>Heinzberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1974</xref>Masumoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>;Nuridsany and P&#x000e9;rennou , Nuridsany and P&#x000e9;rennou Nuridsany and P&#x000e9;rennou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>). Both sexes can make diving bells, but the sexes meet and copulate in the bell of the more sessile and smaller female; eggs are kept in a separate bell. This diving bell also functions as a physical gill (Sch&#x000fc;tz and Taborsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>;Sch&#x000fc;tz et al. , Sch&#x000fc;tz et al.

The fine structure of the diving bell wall was studied by De Bakker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>) and by Woermann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). On the basis of scanning electron microscopy studies, De Bakker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>) described different sizes of silken threads which form the diving bell wall and noticed <italic>&#x0201c;that a kind of film was present, draped over and woven between the strands. It is not certain whether this film is produced by the spider (serving probably as a water repellent layer) or deposited by other aquatic organisms&#x0201d;</italic> (p.139). The aim of the present study was to clarify the origin and role of this film.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><p>Adult specimens of <italic>Argyroneta aquatica</italic> were collected from a garden pond near Cologne and from a densely populated location in Upper Franconia.</p><p>As it was difficult to see details of the diving bell construction between aquatic plants, these spiders were observed under simplified structural conditions. Single individuals were kept in glass vessels (&#x000d8; 12 cm, with about 400 cm<sup>3</sup> tap-water) equipped with three bamboo skewers of equal length which were horizontally clamped between the walls about 2&#x02013;3 cm beneath the surface (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Water temperature was 21&#x000b0;C and the laboratory had natural daylight between September and May and was dimly lit by the campus lighting at night. Exposed to this situation, some spiders clung to the bamboo sticks and remained inactive until night. Others were immediately active and started spinning.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Morphological properties of</bold><bold><italic>Argyroneta</italic></bold><bold>webs.

One female successfully reproduced within its diving bell, resulting in about fifty offspring during the winter months.</p><p>Light-microscopic images of wet and air-dried sheet-webs and diving bells (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E-H) were scanned with a ZEISS Axiophot2, combined with the digital image processing system Axiovision. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures were taken in two different ways: with a Hitachi S 520 after gold-coating of dried samples <italic>en vacuo</italic> (Inst. Physical Chemistry), and with a Fei Quanta FEG 250 (Zoological Institute) in which the wet sheet-webs could be directly exposed without previous fixation or coating.</p><p>Small gas bubbles released below the sheet-web from a fine Hamilton syringe were used to test the permeability of the new web.</p><p>The proteinaceous property of both the threads and the hydrogel of fresh, wet sheet-webs and diving bells was tested with a specific Coomassie stain. After fixation in a mixture of 10% AcOH and 50% MeOH equivalents for at least 6 hrs, the material was stained in this liquid with 0.2% &#x02018;Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250&#x02032; in 0.12 mol AcOH in 50% MeOH equivalent for at least 30 min, followed by a decolouration over two steps in 10% AcOH in 20% MeOH equivalents for about 8 hrs. Finally, the sample was transferred into distilled water (Bradford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Construction of sheet-webs</title><p>During the first night all spiders produced a horizontal web of variable size. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A shows a two-night-old web with a small diving bell and tunnel-like pathways near the glass wall.</p><p>Spiders which had already started to spin in daylight began with single, tightly stretched anchor threads (thickness up to 1.8 &#x003bc;m). These were set between crossing sticks or between a stick and the glass wall. The anchor threads were fixed by a small blob of &#x02018;cement&#x02019; visible on the glass wall. The spiders continued to add bundles of smaller, parallel threads (0.5&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;m thick) between these strong threads, or between the anchor threads and the sticks (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). In this way, a coarse scaffold for a horizontal sheet-web was formed within 2&#x02013;4 hours. In most cases it was still permeable for small gas bubbles (1&#x02013;2 mm in diameter) released below the web by a micropipette. However, during the first night, such web compartments were functionally completed far enough that no bubbles could pass (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Fine structure of horizontal sheet-webs and diving bell walls</title><p>Completed sheet-webs appeared slightly opaque and jelly-like under a stereo microscope, and no mesh-structures were seen. If a new wet sheet-web was exposed to the slowly increasing vacuum of a Fei Quanta FEG scanning electron microscope, its smooth surface became cracked due to the removal of water (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The water content of the hydrogel was obviously higher than that of the threads: the smooth surface first broke up along an interphase of hydrogel and silk threads, similarly to how mud cracks when it dries. In any case, sheet-webs were immediately deformed when exposed to air or to a vacuum (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

In both structures, a few anchor threads were sometimes split into fine threads (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H, arrow).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Wetting property of sheet-webs and diving bell wall</title><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C shows three small air bubbles below a sheet-web and in contact with its surface. The bubbles have a spherical form, indicating that the value of the effective contact angle &#x003b8;<sub>e</sub> at the point of the three phase contact water/air/sheet-web is close to zero. Similar characteristics are found in diving bells after the water spider has brought the first air bubbles underneath a small sheet-web during the very early stages of the construction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Extension and layer thickness</title><p>A diving bell could be formed as soon as the horizontal sheet-web was filled with hydrogel. The air volume was enlarged step by step, whereby the anchored sheet-web lifted slightly due to the buoyancy of the air underneath. After two nights the bell was big enough for the spider to rest in (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Further spinning activities at its inner side reinforced the wall. Anchor threads and part of the remaining sheet-web (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) stabilized the growing bell.</p><p>The sheet-webs in our experiments were considerably larger than those found under more natural conditions, in some cases up to about 80 cm<sup>2</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). This demonstrates the capacity of the spiders&#x02019; silk glands. The thickness of these sheet-webs could not be assessed because various layers of threads were superimposed. The walls of a new diving bell (mounted by a polyethylene net with 0.8 mm mesh size on a microscope slide in water) were about 40 &#x003bc;m thick (n = 15). However, such a preparation did not represent a functionally intact diving bell wall, since the wall was not stretched by the internal pressure of the air volume. The real layer thickness of the diving bell&#x02019;s wall should be far less, presumably about 10 &#x003bc;m, even if strengthened by further spinning secretions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Fine structure of dry sheet-webs and diving bells</title><p>Sheet-webs and the walls of diving bells quickly lose their hydrogel-like appearance and become perforated when they dehydrate (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, left). The hydrogel shrinks, but membranous-like pieces remain between crossing threads. Thin threads can break. Attempts to rehydrate a dehydrated web failed.</p><p>An even stronger drying effect occurred during the gold coating process (for taking SEM-images with a Hitachi model). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (right) shows the framework of various dried threads and the membranous remains of the dried hydrogel between the thin threads. Without gold coating, one could continuously follow this drying process in a Fei Quanta FEG Scanning microscope (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, middle). The linear threads became increasingly thin. When a thread tore, the ends were pulled back towards their points of attachment and swelled to several times their extended diameter, demonstrating their elasticity. The strong anchor threads generally shrank to about 0.5 &#x003bc;m in diameter, while the smaller ones shrank to 0.14&#x02013;0.23 &#x003bc;m before they tore.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The spherical form of air bubbles caught under a sheet-web or inside a new bell indicated that the value of the effective contact angle &#x003b8;<sub>e</sub> at the point of the three phase contact water/air/sheet-web was close to zero, confirming a physical argument according to which the surface of the wall must be hydrophilic (Woermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>).</p><p>The proteinaceous hydrogel, which is described here for the first time, corresponds in its properties to an ensemble of hydrophilic macromolecules forming a network in water. We assume that the solid fragments which can be seen in the SEM-pictures published by De Bakker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>) are remains of this hydrophilic hydrogel component. Several questions about the hydrogel remain open for further investigations, foremost concerning its chemical constitution. Is it some liquid silk, as primarily produced in the spinning apparatus glands, but without further structural differentiation? Or is it a glycoprotein secreted by a distinct type of spinneret gland? The pronounced hydrophilicity of both the silk threads and the hydrogel should also be the subject of further investigation. The new method of keeping the spiders offers the possibility of gaining sufficient amounts of the secreted products.</p><p><italic>Argyroneta aquatica</italic> has three pairs of spinnerets with a large number of spigots (Foelix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>). One has to assume that all components of the composite are products of the silk glands. However, the relationships between the components of the composite and distinct spigots or silk glands have not yet been analysed, nor has the mechanism by which the fine threads become twisted to a strong anchor thread been investigated yet (or vice versa).</p><p>The diving bell has to withstand a hydrostatic pressure difference corresponding to the pressure exerted by a vertical water column of up to several decimetres, and its wall must remain expandable. At the same time, it has the function of a physical gill. The observed combination of threads in the hydrogel which connects them like a flexible binder clearly meets this requirement. During the stepwise enlargement of the diving bell, <italic>Argyroneta aquatica</italic> reinforces it by further spinning on its inner wall. Since all components of the composite are hydrophilic, the adhesive forces between threads and hydrogel contribute to the stability of the bell wall, and the hydrogel can patch up areas of the wall and improve its stability. The adhesive forces between the components are documented by SEM-pictures taken during the drying process (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, middle). It is possible that the hydrogel also lowers the hydrodynamic permeability of the wall, thus suppressing a convective volume flow across the wall, and may retard the gas exchange between the air volume of the diving bell and the external water. Hence, the air-water interface at the open bottom of the diving bell might be important for the overall balance of the gas transfer, as recorded by Seymour and Hetz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>). A retarded gas transfer via the bell wall may be an advantage for the resting spider when low pO<sub>2&#x02212;</sub>values occur on warm summer nights and could reduce the number of the spiders&#x02019; trips to the surface to collect fresh air.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>DN designed and made the study and wrote an earlier version of the manuscript.
