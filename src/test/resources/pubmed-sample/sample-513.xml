A better understanding of the factors underlying their development during infection and of the epitopes they target is needed to elicit similar antibody responses by vaccination. We and others reported that, on average, it takes 2 to 3 years for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to become detectable in the sera of HIV-1-infected subjects and that they target a limited number of epitopes on the HIV Envelope. Here we investigated the emergence and evolution of the earliest cross-reactive neutralizing antibody specificities in one HIV-1-infected individual, AC053. We defined two distinct epitopes on Env that are targeted by the broadly neutralizing antibody responses developed by AC053. The first specificity became evident at 3 years post infection and targeted the CD4-binding site of Env. Antibodies responsible for that specificity neutralized most, but not all, viruses susceptible to neutralization by the plasma antibodies of AC053. The second specificity became apparent approximately a year later. It was due to PG9-like antibodies, which were able to neutralize those viruses not susceptible to the anti-CD4-BS antibodies in AC053. These findings improve <bold><underline>our</underline></bold> understanding of the co-development of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target more than one epitope during natural HIV-1-infection in selected HIV+ subjects. They support the hypothesis that developing broadly neutralizing antibody responses targeting distinct epitopes by immunization could be feasible.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant R01AI081625.

These observations overwhelmingly suggest that the presence of similar types of NAbs elicited by a vaccine would be beneficial to the vaccinee.</p><p>The only target for neutralizing antibodies on HIV is the virally encoded envelope glycoprotein (Env) spike. The functional unit of Env, as expressed on the surface of infectious virions, is a trimer of non-covalently-associated extracellular subunit (gp120) and transmembrane subunit (gp41). Due to the tremendous genetic diversity of the HIV Env, the antibodies elicited by a successful vaccine will have to neutralize a wide range of circulating HIV-1 isolates <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mascola1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Such antibodies are referred to as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Although eliciting such responses by vaccination has not yet been achieved, numerous studies have investigated the development and characteristics of broadly neutralizing antibodies produced during natural HIV-1 infection in humans. Such studies provided novel information on the epitopes targeted by these cross-clade neutralizing activities, and the factors associated with their development. Several studies of infected subjects in early and chronic HIV-1 infection have demonstrated that broadly neutralizing antibody responses develop in approximately 15% of infected individuals <xref rid="pone.0049610-Stamatatos1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Simek1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049610-Euler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and become detectable within 2 to 3 years post infection <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-vanGils1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Our findings indicated that broadly neutralizing antibody responses emerged gradually, and became detectable at approximately 2.5 years of infection. Subsequently, these responses increased both in potency and breadth. Others have also reported on a similar time-dependent development of cross-neutralizing antibody responses during HIV-1 infection <xref rid="pone.0049610-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-vanGils1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Euler2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Epitope mapping studies of the polyclonal IgG responses in plasmas from the cohort we examined indicated that the earliest cross-neutralizing antibody responses targeted either the CD4-BS on gp120 or epitopes not present on monomeric gp120 <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since neutralizing activities against the gp41 subunit of Env were not detectable in the plasmas, we assumed that these later neutralizing activities targeted epitopes present on the oligomeric Env, but not present on monomeric gp120. We also reported that in certain plasmas a small number of epitope specificities contributed to the overall cross-neutralizing activity of a plasma sample. For example, anti-CD4-BS antibodies were responsible for neutralizing a certain number of viruses, and antibodies that could not be mapped to gp120 were responsible for neutralizing different viruses against which the plasma was tested. Two recent studies demonstrated that, indeed, the overall cross-neutralizing activity in a chronically HIV-infected subject could be recapitulated by two monoclonal antibodies isolated from that subject, that target distinct epitopes on Env <xref rid="pone.0049610-Bonsignori1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, those studies did not examine whether both specificities emerged at the same time or not, and how they evolved over time. In the present study we aimed to better understand the relative emergence and evolution of dual epitope specificities in a well-characterized case control from the above-described cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human Plasma Samples</title><p>Samples from subject AC053 from the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) &#x02018;acute/early&#x02019; HIV infection cohort (also referred to as &#x02018;primary&#x02019; cohort) were used in this study.

After collecting the beads on a magnet, the supernatant was removed and the beads were incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in PBS, 0.5%BSA, 0.05% Tween 20. The magnetic beads were washed twice with PBS, 0.1%BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, and stored at 4&#x000b0;C in the same buffer, with the addition of 0.02% Sodium Azide. Bead-coupled Env proteins were tested for antigenic integrity by flow cytometry using known MAbs b12, 447-52D, 2G12, PG9, and 4E10, followed by detection with goat-anti-human-IgG-FITC secondary antibody (data not shown).

The process was repeated with the beads in 0.1 M Glycine-HCl, pH 2.3, and then again in pH 1.7. The final supernatants were buffer exchanged in PBS and washed over a 30 kD Amicon Ultra centrifugation concentrator (Millipore). Concentration of immunoglobulin was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-1000, Thermo). The anti-gp120-antibody depleted plasmas and the anti-gp120 antibodies eluted from gp120-coated beads were tested by ELISA for binding activity, and for neutralizing activity (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Neutralization Assays</title><p>Single round-competent viruses expressing Env&#x02019;s from Clades A, B, and C primary isolates were used in this study.

Briefly, plasma dilutions were pre-incubated with single-round competent virions (pseudovirus) for 90 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. The plasma/pseudovirus mixture was added to TZM-bl cells (plated the day before at 3000 cells per well in a 96-well plate) for 72 hrs at 37&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was removed and 100 &#x000b5;l of Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature away from light, and 75 &#x000b5;l of the lysate was transferred to micro titer plates. The cell-associated luciferase activity for each well was determined on a Fluoroscan Luminometer (Thermo). Percent neutralization was calculated at each plasma dilution as the percent inhibition of viral entry by the plasma sample compared to the absence of plasma. For each plasma/virus combination tested, a neutralization curve (percent neutralization versus plasma dilution) was generated using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California, USA) and the plasma dilution at which 50% neutralization was recorded (IC50) was determined by transforming the data to a log10 scale with fitted sigmoidal dose-response curves. Neutralization breadth of a plasma sample is defined as the percent (0% - 100%) of the 20 isolates neutralized by that sample <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Yearly plasma samples were available for AC053 starting at 0.82 years to 6.85 years post infection, after which the subject initiated antiretroviral therapy. Previously, we characterized the development of the broadly neutralizing antibody response in this subject and demonstrated that at 3.29 years this subject&#x02019;s plasma could neutralize 45% of the 20 cross-clade isolates tested, and at 5.31 years &#x02013;80% <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The cumulative IC50 titers at all time-points (the sum of the reciprocal dilutions to achieve 50% inhibition of infectivity) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049610-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

However, for some isolates tested (for example TRO.11, CAAN, and Zm214M), neutralizing activity of the plasma was unaffected by the depletion of anti-gp120 or anti-MPER antibodies. This led us to hypothesize that at least one additional antibody specificity was present in that subject&#x02019;s plasma; a specificity that targeted an epitope on the virion-associated Env, outside the CD4-BS. The availability of frequent and long-term available samples made this subject a convenient case to study the evolution of dual epitope specificities of the cross-reactive antibody response to HIV.</p><fig id="pone-0049610-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0049610.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cumulative IC50 titers of AC053 longitudinal plasma samples as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</title><p>The IC50 neutralizing plasma antibody titers against 19 heterologous Clade A (blue), B (green), and C (orange) isolates were determined at distinct time points during infection.

To determine how early this specificity emerged in the plasma of AC053, and whether it coincided with the emergence of the overall broadly neutralizing activity in this subject, we performed similar studies with plasmas collected longitudinally. The earliest samples, however, do not display broadly neutralizing activities and do not neutralize SC422661 or PVO.4 <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and therefore we could not use those viruses for this experiment.

To this end, we performed the following set of experiments. Plasmas collected at four time-points after the development of broadly neutralizing antibody responses were depleted from their anti-gp120 antibodies with either WTSF162gp120 (which does not deplete PG9-like antibodies) or SF162K160Ngp120 (which depletes PG9-like antibodies) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049610.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Whether the overall broadly neutralizing activity of an individual&#x02019;s plasma is due to a single or multiple antibody epitope specificities remains a topic of intensive investigation. Recent studies, conducted with samples collected from a very small number of HIV-1-infected subjects, indicate that one or two distinct epitope specificities can recapitulate the majority of the broadly neutralizing activity of the corresponding plasma <xref rid="pone.0049610-Bonsignori1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Falkowska1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.

This information is very relevant not only to future HIV vaccine-design efforts, but also to our understanding of the way the human immune system (specifically its B cell arm) responds to HIV infection. The above observations were, however, made in the context of chronic HIV infection and it remains unknown whether dual specificity broadly neutralizing antibody responses emerge at the same time of infection, or sequentially, in a given subject.</p><fig id="pone-0049610-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0049610.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Timeline of the epitope evolution of cross-reactive NAb responses in AC053.</title><p>The breadth of neutralizing antibody responses (i.e., the percent of heterologous isolates neutralized by plasma samples out of the total isolates tested <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>), was plotted for all available time-points for subject AC053.

The clade B-infected AC053 was part of a cohort of HIV-1-infected subjects that were monitored longitudinally from the time of their HIV-1 infection <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We previously reported that the broadly neutralizing antibody activity of this subject&#x02019;s plasma was due to at least two specificities: one that targets the CD4-BS on gp120 and was effective against many, but not all, isolates the plasma was tested against, and another specify that was not targeting the CD4-BS or the gp41 Env subunit <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The second specificity was effective against viruses that were naturally resistant to this subject&#x02019;s anti-CD4-BS NAbs. The availability of nine plasma samples from AC053 collected between 0.82 to 6.85 years post infection, and the knowledge of when plasma broadly neutralizing antibody responses became detectable in this individual, made it a perfect case for studying the evolution of dual epitope specificities of broadly neutralizing antibody responses during HIV-1 infection.</p><p>Sometime between 0.82 and 1.75 years of infection a glycan-dependent neutralizing activity became apparent in the blood of AC053. The timing of the emergence of this activity coincides with the initial appearance of cross-neutralizing antibodies in this subject. At 0.82 ypi the plasma only neutralized SF162 (out of 20 isolates tested), while at 1.75 ypi the plasma neutralized four out of 20 isolated tested <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Two of these four isolates were clade C and two were clade B. At that point, however, the potency of neutralization was weak and the breadth of neutralization was narrow. In addition, several isolates that are susceptible to PG9 were resistant to neutralization by this plasma. Overall, these observations suggested to us that, at its earliest development, the glycan-dependent neutralizing activity in AC053 plasma was not due to PG9-like antibodies. Of course, one could also argue that PG9-like antibodies began emerging at that point of infection, but that their VH and VL antibody domains had not yet incurred somatic mutations that are required for the broad neutralizing ability of PG9. In the absence of longitudinally isolated MAbs from AC053 it is not possible to address this point directly. Broader cross-neutralizing antibody responses capable of neutralizing at least 50% of isolates tested (from clades A, B and C) became first apparent at approximately 3 ypi and were due to anti-CD4-BS neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049610-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>). As we extensively discussed previously, these anti-CD4-BS cross-neutralizing activities were not effective against all isolates that were susceptible to neutralization by the AC053 plasma <xref rid="pone.0049610-Mikell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For example, they were not effective against the CAAN or TRO.11 viruses. Even the anti-CD4-BS neutralizing activities of plasmas isolated later in infection, which were broader and more potent, were ineffective against these and other viruses. At 3 ypi, cross-neutralizing specificities that are dependent on the presence of a glycan at position 160 were not evident in AC053. This second cross-neutralizing specificity became apparent sometime around 4.30 ypi. Because of its dependency on the 160 glycan but not on glycans positioned in regions of Env targeted by the PGT-like antibodies or 2G12-like antibodies, we believe that this second cross-neutralizing specificity is due to PG9-like antibodies. We do not believe it is due to PG16-like antibodies, because the neutralizing activity of PG16 cannot be blocked by SF162K160N gp120, while that of PG9 and of the AC053 plasma antibodies are efficiently blocked by that recombinant protein.</p><p>We used two independent methods to demonstrate the presence of a PG9-like glycan-dependent epitope specificity of the broadly neutralizing antibody response in AC053. The use of glycosidase inhibitors, such as kifunensine, to enrich high mannose glycans is a well-established method and has been previously used to identify glycan-dependent epitopes targeted by anti-HIV antibody responses <xref rid="pone.0049610-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Lavine1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Doores1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Of note, the nature of the glycosylation pattern on HIV Env can be influenced by the host cell and culture conditions used <xref rid="pone.0049610-Doores2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049610-Raska1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The majority of studies on antibody responses to HIV have used pseudoviruses produced in cell lines, such as the 293T used in this study. However, it is possible that these viruses have different N-linked glycosylation pattern than the ones replicating in infected hosts. Consequently, viruses grown in T cells treated with kifunensine could potentially have different susceptibility to neutralization than the ones produced by cell lines. Despite these caveats, the studies with glycosidase inhibitors described here provided reproducible and interpretable results that were in agreement with the other experimental strategy used &#x02013; depletion with a SF162 K160N glycoprotein.</p><p>Our results are in agreement, and extend, those recently reported by Bonsignori et al <xref rid="pone.0049610-Bonsignori1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> that two distinct broadly neutralizing antibody specificities, one against the CD4-BS and the other against the V1V2 loop (PG9-like), can be simultaneously present in an HIV+ subject with broad serum neutralizing activities. The timing of relative emergence of these two distinct specificities was unknown in that study. Here we independently show similar dual specificities in a different subject, but we also report that the anti-CD4-BS specificity emerged first, while the PG9-like specificity emerged approximately 1&#x02013;2 years later. It remains unknown whether these two types of specificities can be generated simultaneously in an HIV-infected subject and whether they can be elicited simultaneously by vaccination. We do not currently have viral sequence information on AC053 to define how the virus evolved in that subject before and after the development of the anti-CD4-BS neutralizing antibodies. The V2 loop is positioned in a way that limits the accessibility of the CD4-BS to neutralizing antibodies <xref rid="pone.0049610-Saunders1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049610-Stamatatos2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that in its effort to escape their action, the virus altered the amino acid composition and/or glycosylation pattern of the V2 loop, and such escape viral env clones were the ones that stimulated B cells to produce PG9-like antibodies. We believe that the earliest development of glycan-dependent neutralizing specificities aided in the development of PG9-like antibodies later in infection.</p><p>In summary, our studies support efforts to elicit broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies of multiple epitope specificities by vaccination. Most likely this will be achieved by prime-boost immunization protocols, during which sequential immunizations with distinct Env proteins will stimulate the development of broadly NAbs of distinct epitope specificities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0049610.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
