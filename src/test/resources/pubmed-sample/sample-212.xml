Several changes in immunologic profiles were noted in mice treated with RX-5902 and the combination, including an increase in activated TILs and a decrease in human myeloid populations, that are often associated with immunosuppression in a tumor microenvironment. RX-5902 also was shown to potentiate the effects of checkpoint inhibitors of CTLA4 and the PD-1 inhibitor in the 4&#x02009;T-1 murine TNBC model. These findings indicate that RX-5902 may have important immunomodulatory, as well as anti-tumor activity, in TNBC when combined with a checkpoint inhibitor.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>RX-5902</kwd><kwd>Triple-negative breast cancer</kwd><kwd>p68</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2;-Catenin</kwd><kwd>PD-1 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Humanized mouse models</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P30CA046934-25</award-id><award-id>1K23CA172691-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diamond</surname><given-names>Jennifer R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CPRIT</institution></funding-source><award-id>RR160093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eckhardt</surname><given-names>S.

We utilized the novel inhibitor of p-p68, RX-5902, due to its ability to block the coactivator function of p-p68 and prevent p-p68-mediated nuclear shuttling of &#x003b2;-catenin, thereby negating its transcriptional activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway is a well-characterized driver of several cancers, a promoter of cancer progression and mediator of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors through its dysregulation of tumor-immune cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Specifically, &#x003b2;-catenin signaling directly affects regulators critical for T-cell tumor infiltration, and antitumor activities of effector T cells, T helper cells and regulatory T cells. Given the association of elevated &#x003b2;-catenin signaling with low TIL infiltration and in resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, we sought to determine if RX-5902, when combined with anti-CTLA4 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, could enhance anti-tumor and immunologic responses in a preclinical models of TNBC. Towards this end, we utilized the 4&#x02009;T1 mouse model of TNBC as well as a hu-CB-BRGS humanized mouse model bearing human MDA-MB-231 TNBC xenograft tumors which would allow for end of treatment immune analyses to further elucidate the mechanisms of RX-5902 action.</p><p id="Par54">Our intention in the humanized mouse studies was to evaluate the human immune populations in the tumor in an attempt to correlate changes with treatments and/or immune responses (tumor growth). Our hu-CB-BRGS HIS mouse model, similar to many humanized mouse models, generates a multi-lineage human immune system, with caveats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The lymphocyte lineage is overrepresented, initially by B cells and followed by T cells. Thus these lineages are easy to detect and interrogate. Human myeloid cells do develop, but more variably and less robustly, and are most abundant in the bone marrow and non-lymph organs, such as liver and lung, physiologically appropriate locations. NK cells that develop are immature and non-functional, in the absence of exogenous IL-15, as reported in several publications regarding HIS mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given these limitations, and the abundant role of T cells following checkpoint blockade immunotherapy treatments in both mouse and human cancers, we focused our analysis on the lymphocytes, and more specifically functional assays for the T cells. We enumerated the frequency of both human B and myeloid cells as well, however we did not interrogate their subsets and functions. We also did not evaluate the NK cell populations, given that this is a minor, non-functional population of the immune system in this model. Since immature NK cells do not express CD11b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the NK population in our mice would be represented in the Lin- (CD3-CD19-CD33-CD11b-CD11c-) fraction, which is very minor in our system. The human myeloid population consists of numerous subtypes, including monocytes, macrophages and multiple types of dendritic cells. As with all immune cell subsets, the function of each can be immune-activating or suppressing, dependent on environmental context. In tumors, the myeloid lineage is most often associated with immunosuppression with a large population of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs, M2) and MDSCs. The flow cytometric phenotypes of these lineages are still disputed in the literature; however, a common, albeit not exclusive, feature of immunosuppressive myeloid cells is a lower expression of HLA-DR. Therefore, we calculated the HLA-DR high frequency as an indication of ability to present antigen. Notably, we did not detect significant alterations in the frequency of myeloid lineage cells in any treatment group.</p><p id="Par55">In dosing studies, we found that in both models, RX-5902 demonstrated anti-tumor activity on its own but this was significantly enhanced when combined with checkpoint inhibitors. The tumors in the hu-CB-BRGS MDA-MB-231 bearing mice were well-infiltrated with human immune cells, unlike other &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d; tumors we and others have observed with the use of this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The major infiltrates are T cells and myeloid cells, with very few B cells consistent with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Treatment with RX-5902, both alone and in combination with nivolumab, resulted in changes in human immune components in MDA-MB-231 tumors that are largely consistent with reports in other human and mouse studies involving inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Specifically, we observed increases in total T cells and CD8+ T cell infiltration with RX-5902. In our study these RX-5902 exposed T cells, both CD4 and CD8, produced increased IFN&#x003b3;, as observed in other reports with &#x003b2;-catenin inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, this T cell increase did not correlate with tumor growth, suggesting this response was suboptimal as a single agent. Notably, in our system we also observed consistent increases of Granzyme B production, again by both CD4 and CD8 T cells, when the RX-5902 is combined with nivolumab. Further investigation is required to understand if the Granzyme B pathway is related to the decreased tumor growth, however the cytotoxic nature of this pathway is intriguing. Indeed we have seen this correlation in other humanized mouse immunotherapy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and there are reports that Granzyme B predicts immunotherapy response in other models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We also quantified the Treg population by measuring co-expression of CD25 and FoxP3, but in contrast to other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we did not detect changes in the frequencies among treatment groups of this clearly detectable population that represented on average 3.5% of human TILs (Supplementary Fig <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A previous report studying PRI-724, a CBP/&#x003b2;-catenin inhibitor, in a mouse model of colorectal cancer, observed increases in the Treg population with drug treatment, suggesting that a decrease in Tregs is not a consistent finding with &#x003b2;-catenin inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our analysis of the myeloid populations showed that although they are underrepresented in general in humanized mice, we did observe substantial representation of these cells in tumors. An increase in CD103+ DC in tumors has been observed in some tumors with &#x003b2;-catenin inhibition. While we did not look at this population specifically, we did observe an increased trend in MHC Class II (HLA-DR) expression on tumor myeloid cells with nivolumab or combination therapy. The higher Class II expression is often associated with increased antigen presentation and inflammatory myeloid cells, consistent with increased antigen presentation by DCs. One interesting result from our study is an increased expression of inhibitory receptor TIM-3 on the myeloid cells in the tumor with RX-5902 alone, indicating that this co-receptor is a possible combination target. In contrast to the changes we observed in treated immune cells, we did not observe changes in the expression of MHC Class I or II molecules or PD-L1 inhibitory receptor on the tumor themselves, suggesting that in our model the major influence of the &#x003b2;-catenin inhibitor is on the immune system and less so on the tumor. We of course cannot rule out that other changes, that were not measured, occurred as well. Although we observed T cell phenotype, activation and functional differences among treatment groups, and not changes in either B cell or myeloid populations, we cannot rule out changes among myeloid subsets with treatments, as we did not examine these populations in depth.</p><p id="Par57">Human immune system mice do not fully recapitulate the immune environment of human patients. The immune system takes time to develop and T cells often do not appear until months after cord blood engraftment. There is also variability among chimerism. To take these issues into account, we verified the presence of T cells in blood of mice before tumor injection and randomized our treatment groups according to overall human and T cell chimerism. In addition, we ensured the development of LNs at end of study and splenic chimerism as inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the kinetics of these humanized mice experiments are important and may affect the results. In our studies, we harvested mice over a three-week time period, for both practical reasons and to acquire as much tumor growth data as possible. Because the MDA-MB-231 tumors in the combination arm grew at a far slower rate, they were allowed to continue in the study for a longer time period before harvest and analysis, which may explain some discrepant data observed, such as lower tumor T cell numbers. Since the tumor-immune interface is a dynamic process, fluctuating between activated and suppressed responses, it is possible that our snap-shot of the immune system, as for all similar immune interrogations following treatments in mice or humans, is affected by these different time points. It is well-appreciated that T cell activation is a dynamic process, beginning with upregulation of activation markers, rapid proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, followed by exhaustion of T cells that can include activation-induced cell death. In this experiment, there were fewer T cells in the combination-treated animals, with a higher death rate as seen by lower frequency of live cells among the CD8+ T cells. The increased number of T cells, frequency of live CD8+ T cells, and expression of activation markers HLA-DR and Tim-3 expression in the RX-5092 cohort suggest more activated T cells in this group. However, this could also indicate a T cell response earlier in the process. Given the dynamic changes in the constitution of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment over time, this difference in timing of obtaining tumor tissue for the planned immune correlatives hinders clear interpretations as to whether the T cells, or other immune subsets, are responsible for the tumor response. In future studies efforts will be made to minimize these differences.</p><p id="Par58">The final outcome of an immune response such as tumor growth inhibition is a highly coordinated process, involving integration of both positive and negative signals across multiple, interacting cell receptors and cell types, including the antigen presenting cell and the responding lymphocyte. Even very sophisticated analyses such as mass cytometry, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data of the immune populations within tumors (or blood) are at best correlative to the tumor response, at the moment in time in which the immune cells are being evaluated. Attempts to understand mechanism of tumor rejection by an immune response is always muddled with these limitations. However, the evaluation of the immune phenotypes, characteristics and functions within a model, and identifying differences among treatment cohorts, can direct further studies. Our studies suggest that RX-5092 may alter T cell responses, although we cannot say whether this is a direct effect on the T cell or through antigen presenting cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">Together, these preclinical models allowed us to demonstrate that RX-5902, in addition to its direct anti-tumor activity, can induce positive alterations in the tumor immunologic environment that may allow for enhanced responses to immunotherapies. This may be due to its effects on decreased &#x003b2;-catenin signaling, though additional effects on other p68 targets is also possible. These preclinical results support a planned Phase 2 clinical trial combining RX-5902 with nivolumab in patients with TNBC, which will include biological correlates designed to identify biomarkers of response that may inform improved patient selection strategies for this population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
