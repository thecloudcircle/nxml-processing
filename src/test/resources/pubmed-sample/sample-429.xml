To explore the epigenetic change and the role of <italic>DACT2</italic> in thyroid cancer, 7 thyroid cancer cell lines, 10 cases of non-cancerous thyroid tissue samples and 99 cases of primary thyroid cancer samples were involved in this study. DACT2 was expressed and unmethylated in K1, SW579, FTC-133, TT, W3 and 8505C cell lines. Loss of expression and complete methylation was found in TPC-1 cells. Restoration of DACT2 expression was induced by 5-aza-2&#x02032;deoxycytidine treatment. It demonstrates that the expression of <italic>DACT2</italic> was regulated by promoter region methylation. In human primary papillary thyroid cancer, 64.6% (64/99) was methylated and methylation of DACT2 was related to lymph node metastasis (p&#x0003c;0.01). Re-expression of <italic>DACT2</italic> suppresses cell proliferation, invasion and migration in TPC-1 cells. The activity of TCF/LEF was inhibited by DACT2 in wild-type or mutant &#x003b2;-catenin cells. The activity of TCF/LEF was increased by co-transfecting DACT2 and Dvl2 in wild-type or mutant &#x003b2;-catenin cells. Overexpression of wild-type &#x003b2;-catenin promotes cell migration and invasion in DACT2 stably expressed cells. The expression of &#x003b2;-catenin, c-myc, cyclinD1 and MMP-9 were decreased and the level of phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin (p-&#x003b2;-catenin) was increased after restoration of DACT2 expression in TPC-1 cells. The expression of &#x003b2;-catenin, c-myc, cyclinD1 and MMP-9 were increased and the level of p-&#x003b2;-catenin was reduced after knockdown of DACT2 in W3 and SW579 cells. These results suggest that DACT2 suppresses human papillary thyroid cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting Wnt signaling. In conclusion, <italic>DACT2</italic> is frequently methylated in papillary thyroid cancer. DACT2 expression was regulated by promoter region methylation. <italic>DACT2</italic> suppresses papillary thyroid cancer proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting Wnt signaling.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program (973 Program No. 2012CB934002, 2010CB912802), National Key Scientific instrument Special Program of China (Grant No. 2011YQ03013405), National High-tech R &#x00026; D Program (863 Program No. SS2012AA020314, SS2012AA020821, SS2012AA020303) and National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81121004, 81071953, 81161120432).

Follicular epithelial cell-derived thyroid cancer was categorized into three histological types, including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC, 80%), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC, 15%), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC, 2&#x02013;5%). While the medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is developed from parafollicular C cells, is very rare <xref rid="pone.0112336-Xing1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112336-SastrePerona1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although the prognosis of thyroid carcinoma is much better, it is still very hard to select therapeutic method. The strategy of PTC treatment mainly includes surgical resection, adjunctive radioiodine ablation and thyrotropin suppression.

To further understand the role of DACT2 in thyroid cancer, we detected the promoter region methylation in papillary thyroid cancer first. DACT2 is frequently methylated in human papillary thyroid cancer and methylation of DACT2 is associated with lymph node metastasis. These findings suggest that DACT2 methylation may serve as detective and prognostic marker of papillary thyroid cancer. The wound healing and transwell assay were employed to evaluate the effect of DACT2 on thyroid cancer metastasis. As expected, re-expression of DACT2 inhibits cell migration and invasion in TPC-1cells. The expression of MMP-9 was reduced after restoration of DACT2 expression in TPC-1cells and increased after knockdown of DACT2 in W3 and SW579 cells<monospace>. </monospace>As DACT2 expression was regulated by promoter region hypermethylation in papillary thyroid cancer, DACT2 methylation may involve in thyroid carcinogenesis. To answer these questions, the function of DACT2 was further studied. Cell proliferation and colony formation was inhibited, and G1 phase arrest was induced by DACT2 in thyroid cancer cells. These results demonstrate that DACT2 is a tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer. To further understand the mechanism of DACT2 on thyroid carcinogenesis, the effect of DACT2 on the Wnt signaling was analyzed. The activity of TCF/LEF reporter was inhibited by DACT2 and increased after overexpression of Dvl2 according to the Topflash reporter system analysis in TPC-1 cells. The expression of &#x003b2;-catenin and its downstream targets, c-myc, cyclinD1 and MMP-9, were suppressed by DACT2 in TPC-1cells. The role of DACT2 in Wnt signaling was further validated by siRNA knocking down in W3 and SW579 cells. Overexpression of &#x003b2;-catenin promotes cell migration and invasion in DACT2 stably expressed TPC-1 cells. Above results suggest that DACT2 inhibits thyroid carcinogenesis and metastasis by inhibiting Wnt signaling pathway. It is possible to treat or prevent papillary thyroid cancer by targeting de-methylation of DACT2 to inhibit Wnt signaling.</p><p>In conclusion, DACT2 is frequently methylated in human papillary thyroid cancer and methylation of DACT2 is related to lymphoid node metastasis. DACT2 expression was regulated by promoter region methylation. DACT2 suppresses cell proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting Wnt signaling in thyroid papillary cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112336.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
