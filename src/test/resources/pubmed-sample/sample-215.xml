Therefore, many researchers have suggested that small-EV proteins are potential biomarkers for diseases such as cancer. Colon cancer (CC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) show low sensitivity (~&#x02009;40%), and thus the demand for novel biomarkers for CC diagnosis is increasing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, we identified biomarkers for diagnosing CC through proteomic analysis of small-EVs from CC cell lines. These small-EVs were characterized by western blot analysis, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy and analyzed using mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Five selected proteins were found to be upregulated in CC by western blot analysis. Among the candidate proteins, tetraspanin 1 (TSPAN1) was found to be upregulated in plasma EVs from CC patients compared to those from healthy controls (HCs) with 75.7% sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These results suggest that TSPAN1 is a potent non-invasive biomarker for CC detection.

This disease mainly occurs in males and females 55&#x02013;85&#x000a0;years of age; this age group accounts for approximately 80% of CC cases. Common risk factors for CC include obesity, family history, and physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CC is typically diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy and can be carried out by either sigmoidoscopy (as &#x0003e;&#x02009;35% of tumors are in the rectosigmoid) or (preferably) total colonoscopy. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, these methods have limitations in terms of their convenience, risk, cost, and sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Blood-based biomarkers can be analyzed easily, quickly, and economically, and therefore have the potential to greatly improve diagnostic efficiency. In 1965, Dr. Joseph Gold discovered a protein that is normally found in the gastrointestinal tissue during fetal development in the blood of patients with colon cancer, which was named as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). This protein is now used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of CC in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, most biomarkers for other cancers, including CEA, show limited sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, novel diagnostic biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity are required for diagnosing CC.</p><p id="Par23">Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles secreted by a variety of cell types and are found in various body fluids including the blood, urine, breast milk, and malignant ascites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These vesicles also contain oncogenic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], mRNAs, and microRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] that reflect parental cell functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and can be horizontally transferred to recipient cells to regulate their characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Among these, small extracellular vesicles (small-EVs), including exosomes, have been studied in various cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and small-EV cargo contains more oncoproteins than large EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Cancer cells secrete small-EVs containing oncogenic molecules into the extracellular environment, which play important roles in metastasis, angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, modulation of the tumor microenvironment, and immune suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

However, most methods require a long time and large sample volume for small-EV isolation. To overcome these problems, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to detect small-EV proteins without isolating the small-EVs. We examined whether this method can be used to diagnose early breast cancer; surface proteins (Del-1 and fibronectin) in small-EVs were detected in plasma obtained from patients with breast cancer with high sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Therefore, we focused on identifying biomarkers for diagnosing CC by analyzing small-EV proteins. In this study, we investigated cancer-related proteins from HCT-116 and HT-29 CC cell-derived small-EVs by proteomic analysis to identify diagnostic biomarkers for CC. By profiling of small-EVs from two CC cell lines, 464 proteins were identified. Among these, approximately 90% were reported in the ExoCarta database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Assignment of molecular function, biological process, cellular component, localization, and pathways revealed similar patterns to those observed in our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This also corresponded with the current hypothesis for small-EV formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows our strategy for selecting a diagnostic marker. We selected biomarker candidates that were cancer-related proteins in small-EVs produced by and exposed on the outer surface of cancer cells.</p><p id="Par47">TSPAN1 is expressed in normal human tissues and carcinomas. Recently, TSPAN1 was also reported as a cancer-related protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In several studies, overexpression of TSPAN1 was observed in liver cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric carcinoma. TSPAN1 plays a role in cell mitosis and causes abnormal cell differentiation. It was detected by RT-PCR in cervical cancer, lung cancer, squamous carcinoma, colon cancer, and breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Wollscheid et al. evaluated <italic>TSPAN1</italic> mRNA levels by RT-PCR and TSPAN1 protein levels by immunohistochemistry in cervical cancer and found that the gene was expressed in grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, particularly in all undifferentiated cervical carcinomas and adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. They observed that TSPAN1 gene expression correlated with cell proliferation and suggested that it may be useful as a marker for cervical cancer prognosis.</p><p id="Par48">In this study, a new strategy was established for identifying small-EV markers for CC diagnosis. However, further studies are required to evaluate their diagnostic value in clinical scenarios and elucidate their biological role(s) in cancer progression and metastasis. We performed western blotting to confirm the expression of candidate proteins in small-EVs from CC cells and normal colon cells and confirmed that SLC1A5 and LGALS3BP were differentially expressed between small-EVs and cells. However, previous studies reported that specific sorting of small-EV proteins can lead to changes in their composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Expression levels of candidate proteins in small-EVs from the plasma of CC patients were confirmed by western blotting. We isolated small-EVs using ExoQuick solution. This method was fast and isolated small-EVs using only a small volume of plasma. However, recent studies reported that in current precipitation protocols, such as ExoQuick, small-EVs from cells and plasma were co-isolated with serum proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, we used an optimized ExoQuick method to eliminate contaminants, such as albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently, efforts have been undertaken to isolate small-EVs using more effective methods such as size-exclusion chromatography and tangential flow filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Western blot analysis of 12 clinical samples revealed that TSPAN1 is a potent biomarker for CC diagnosis. Notably, the expression level of TSPAN1 was significantly higher in CC patients than in HCs. This result was validated by ELISA for 67 clinical samples.</p><p id="Par49">TSPAN1-positive EVs showed diagnostic potential for CC with high sensitivity (75.7%). In contrast, the CC biomarkers CEA and CA19&#x02013;9 are currently adjunctively used for diagnosis and monitoring because of their low sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These results suggest that using TSPAN1-positive EVs or their combination with CEA or CA19&#x02013;9 can increase the efficacy of diagnosis and that this strategy for discovering small-EV markers for cancer diagnosis is effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">In conclusion, this study demonstrated that TSPAN1 was abundantly present in small-EVs from two CC cell lines. Further, analysis of small-EV proteins can be beneficial for identifying biofluid-based biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Because cancer-derived small-EVs are found in body fluids such as the plasma and serum, TSPAN1 can act as a small-EV biomarker for advanced CC diagnosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
