Despite its popular use in controlling weeds and algae, very limited information is available regarding its toxicity. In the present study, pregnant mice were orally exposed to low doses (0, 5, 50, or 500 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight per day) of simazine during gestation and lactation, during which no overt maternal toxic response was detected, and their offspring was assessed. Simazine-exposed male offspring showed decreased body, testicular, and epididymis weight, increased testicular apoptosis, and decreased sperm concentrations. Differentially-expressed genes in the testes of male offspring exposed to simazine were identified by DNA microarray, revealing 775 upregulated and 791 downregulated genes; among these, the relaxin-family peptide receptor 1 (Rxfp1), which is the receptor for relaxin hormone, was significantly downregulated. In addition, the expression of target genes in the relaxin pathway, including nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) and Nos3, was significantly decreased in simazine-exposed F1 testes. Moreover, simazine inhibited NO release, and knockdown of Rxfp1 blocked the inhibitory action of simazine on NO production in testicular Leydig cells. Therefore, the present study provides a better understanding of the toxicities associated with the widely used herbicide simazine at environmentally relevant doses by demonstrating that maternal exposure interferes with the pleotropic relaxin-NO signaling pathway, impairing normal development and reproductive activity of male offspring.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korean government (MEST) (2010-0026211).

In the United States, an estimated 5 to 7 million pounds of simazine are applied to agricultural crops each year, and an additional 1.2 million pounds are applied for nonagricultural uses <xref rid="pone.0044856-Agency1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Exposure routes of simazine include contaminated drinking water, dermal contact, and inhalation from occupational exposure <xref rid="pone.0044856-Riviere1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Simazine is one of most commonly detected pesticides in surface and ground water due to herbicide runoff <xref rid="pone.0044856-Salasnich1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

However, numerous recent <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have reported an array of toxic responses to atrazine, a close homologue of simazine, affecting neuroendocrine systems, antioxidant mechanisms, behavior, and mammary gland development <xref rid="pone.0044856-Belloni1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044856-Foradori1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>In 2009, simazine was included in the final list of chemicals tested in an endocrine disruptor screening program (EDSP) by the U.S. EPA due to its characteristics of multiple exposure pathways and high production volume. Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are exogenous agents that interferes with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones that are responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, reproduction, development, and/or behavior <xref rid="pone.0044856-Brevini1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To date, toxicological data for simazine are scarce; in particular, mammalian multigenerational studies after <italic>in vivo</italic> exposures of low doses of simazine during fetal and neonatal periods have not been reported. The &#x0201c;no observed adverse effect levels&#x0201d; (NOAELs) for acute and chronic dietary exposure of simazine in all populations are 30 mg/kg/day and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively, and US EPA&#x02019;s Office of Water established a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for simazine in finished drinking water of 4.0 parts per billion (ppb) <xref rid="pone.0044856-Agency1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Based on these facts, we selected very low simazine doses at 5, 50, and 500 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight per day by gavage in the present study. The development of the reproductive system is under tight hormonal regulation, and fetal and neonatal stages are the most vulnerable periods for proper development. Therefore, we assessed the risks of maternal exposure to low concentrations of simazine during these developmental periods and found that simazine exerts testicular toxic responses in male offspring involving the relaxin-family peptide receptor 1 (Rxfp1)-mediated nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Simazine (CAS No. 122-34-9; 99.9% pure) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Laborchemikalien GmbH (Wunstorfer Str. 40, Seelze, Germany), and the other chemicals used in the experiments were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Animals and Simazine Exposures</title><p>Eleven-week-old virgin C57BL/6 female mice and eighteen-week-old DBA/2 male mice were obtained from SLC, Inc.

It is of particular interest that perinatal exposure of simazine at low doses that do not elicit overt maternal toxicity exhibited detrimental effects in offspring that appear later in adult life, supporting the hypothesis that the fetal and neonatal periods are critical for development and that offspring are vulnerable to damage by exposure to simazine during these periods.</p><p>Despite its prevalent agricultural use, simazine is considered to have low toxicity, currently available toxicological studies of simazine are limited. To investigate the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to simazine-induced effects on the testis such as enhanced apoptosis and reduced testicular weight and sperm concentration, we performed microarray analyses of neonatal mouse testes to identify changes in the transcriptome profile upon simazine exposure. Rxfp1 was found to be downregulated. Rxfp1, initially known as LGR7, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for a pleiotropic hormone, relaxin <xref rid="pone.0044856-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Relaxin was originally classified as a peptide hormone that plays a major role in female reproductive functions during parturition and lactation <xref rid="pone.0044856-Kohsaka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044856-Kuenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Later, the expression of Rxfp1 was also observed in the reproductive tract of the male rat <xref rid="pone.0044856-Filonzi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although the exact functions of relaxin and Rxfp1 in the testes remain unclear at this point, <italic>Rxfp1</italic>-knockout F<sub>1</sub> male mice exhibit decreased testicular weight, increased testicular apoptosis, impaired spermatogenesis, and reduced fertility <xref rid="pone.0044856-KrajncFranken1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Strikingly, these phenotypes closely resemble the effects observed in male offspring exposed to simazine, implying that simazine-mediated Rxfp1 downregulation is a likely mechanism responsible for its testicular toxicity. Since simazine exposure decreased both mRNA and protein levels of Rxfp1, simazine likely modulates transcription of Rxfp1 directly or indirectly although the exact mechanism needs to be studied.</p><p>The binding of relaxin to Rxfp1 activates G-proteins. The activated G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> subunit stimulates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and increases cAMP production, which subsequently activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>B, leading to stimulation of their target genes, which include Nos2, Vegf, and Mmp9 <xref rid="pone.0044856-Bathgate1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044856-Ivell1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Three major isoforms of Nos enzymes exist: endothelial Nos (Nos3) and neuronal Nos (Nos1), which are responsible for the continuous basal release of NO, and inducible Nos (Nos2), which is considered to be the more critical isoform, as its expression can be controlled by external factors <xref rid="pone.0044856-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. NO is a small, diffusible, short-lived free radical gas active in diverse biological responses. In the testis, NO modulates germ cell viability and development and coordinates the testicular production of hormones and cytokines <xref rid="pone.0044856-Weissman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044856-Andric1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It has also been reported that testicular NO production is involved in compromised spermatogenesis in infertile men with varicocele <xref rid="pone.0044856-Shiraishi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this study, simazine-exposed mouse testes showed significant reductions in the expression levels of downstream target genes of the known relaxin-Rxfp1 pathways, especially Nos2 and Nos3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044856-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In consequence, a decreased level of NO was expected in the testes of simazine-exposed offspring, and correspondingly, we were able to demonstrate simazine-induced reduction of NO production in rat testicular Leydig cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044856-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Reduction of lipopolysaccharide-induced NO production by simazine has also been observed in murine macrophage <xref rid="pone.0044856-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Apoptosis is a pivotal homeostatic mechanism for maintaining cell populations throughout the development and aging of an organism. Diverse classes of chemicals that elicit toxic responses are mediated by apoptotic cell death. In the present study, we observed increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the testes and the ovaries of mouse offspring that were maternally exposed to simazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044856-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that simazine can induce apoptosis. The mechanism by which simazine promotes apoptosis is unclear, as the expressions of members of Bcl-2 family, which are pivotal proteins that regulate cellular survival and death, are not prominently altered upon simazine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044856-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). One observation that may explain how simazine promotes apoptosis is the lowered NO production upon simazine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044856-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), which may result in failure to protect cells from apoptosis, since physiological levels of NO are protective <xref rid="pone.0044856-Marathe1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044856-Jee1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>One of the main characteristics of the simazine-exposed male offspring was smaller body size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044856-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044856-t004">4</xref>). Smaller offspring were also reported by other studies after exposure to atrazine <xref rid="pone.0044856-Fraites1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044856-Rayner1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, a chemical homologous to simazine, at more than 1000-fold higher doses than the ones we used in the current study. These observations are in accordance with two recent epidemiological studies that identified an association between fetal growth restriction and maternal exposure to atrazine and/or simazine <xref rid="pone.0044856-Chevrier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044856-OchoaAcuna1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, suggesting that maternal exposure to triazine herbicides coherently inhibit normal fetal growth. Although more comprehensive investigational studies are required, the inhibitory activities of simazine toward the relaxin-Rxfp1 signaling pathway demonstrated in this study are a plausible mechanism that can account for the inhibitory effect of simazine on growth. In support of this hypothesis, the anti-proliferative effect of atrazine has been demonstrated in various different cell lines including Chinese hamster ovary cells, human hepatoma cells, and fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0044856-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044856-Manske1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It has been shown that relaxin upregulates Nos2 and increases the proliferation of rat Sertoli cells <xref rid="pone.0044856-Cardoso1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Moreover, the expression of relaxin is higher in tumors and is strongly correlated with increased proliferation <xref rid="pone.0044856-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Downregulation of its receptor, Rxfp1, dramatically reduced tumor growth, as evidenced by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of the xenograft tumor <xref rid="pone.0044856-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>The testis is the central organ in the male reproductive system, being responsible for sperm production. The testis is composed of seminiferous tubules and the interstitial spaces between the tubules. Spermatogenesis is a dynamic and complex process leading to testicular germ cell development <xref rid="pone.0044856-Carreau1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044856-ODonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The quality of human semen has been shown to decline over a 50-year period, and epidemiology studies suggest that environmental exposures are associated with the decline in sperm quality <xref rid="pone.0044856-Swan1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044856-Jurewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Decreased weights of reproductive and endocrine organs including testis, epididymis, Cowper&#x02019;s gland, seminal vesicle and thymus gland upon simazine exposure could be a consequence of reduced body weight. However, even though the decrease in organ weight became smaller after adjustment for body weight, the trend was still present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044856-t004">Table 4</xref>). The decreased sperm concentrations observed in simazine-exposed mice may be secondary to smaller reproductive organs, especially since sperm quality was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044856-t005">Table 5</xref>). At the same time, however, the possibility of a direct effect of simazine on the reproductive function of male mice should be also considered. Careful further investigations are required to explore this association.</p><p>The significance of the present study is the identification of relaxin-Rxfp1 signaling as a novel pathway regulated by simazine, which could be associated with the disturbed growth and sperm production elicited upon simazine exposure. In particular, in contrast to previous studies that used doses of hundreds of mg/kg of body weight of atrazine <xref rid="pone.0044856-Fraites1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044856-Rayner1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, the present study provides more useful information for risk assessments of simazine not only because the doses of simazine tested in the current study are very low (less than 1000-fold the doses of previous studies) and more similar to those typical of environmental exposure, but also because the maternal simazine exposure at this low doses elicits toxic responses in exposed offspring. Therefore, the results of the current transgenerational animal study suggest that consumption of simazine-contaminated diets by mothers may influence the development of offspring and cause dysfunctional reproductive function. Therefore, a more comprehensive re-evaluation of the risks of triazine-family herbicides is imperative.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to M Park, JH Kim, M Won, and J Han for their helpful assistance regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiments and data analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0044856-Agency1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Agency EP (2006) Reregistration eligibility decision (RED) document for Simazine List A.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0044856-Riviere1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
