ACEs included abuse (emotional, physical, sexual), witnessing domestic violence, parental separation or divorce, or growing up in a household where members with mentally ill, substance abusers, or sent to prison. We used the ACE score (an integer count of the 8 categories of ACEs) as a measure of cumulative exposure to traumatic stress during childhood. Two methods of case ascertainment were used to identify incident lung cancer through 2005 follow-up: 1) hospital discharge records and 2) mortality records obtained from the National Death Index.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The ACE score showed a graded relationship to smoking behaviors. We identified 64 cases of lung cancer through hospital discharge records (age-standardized risk = 201 &#x000d7; 100,000<sup>-1 </sup>population) and 111 cases of lung cancer through mortality records (age-standardized mortality rate = 31.1 &#x000d7; 100,000<sup>-1 </sup>person-years). The ACE score also showed a graded relationship to the incidence of lung cancer for cases identified through hospital discharge (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0004), mortality (<italic>P </italic>= 0.025), and both methods combined (<italic>P </italic>= 0.001). Compared to persons without ACEs, the risk of lung cancer for those with &#x02265; 6 ACEs was increased approximately 3-fold (hospital records: RR = 3.18, 95%CI = 0.71-14.15; mortality records: RR = 3.55, 95%CI = 1.25-10.09; hospital or mortality records: RR = 2.70, 95%CI = 0.94-7.72). After <italic>a priori </italic>consideration of a causal pathway (i.e., ACEs &#x02192; smoking &#x02192; lung cancer), risk ratios were attenuated toward the null, although not completely. For lung cancer identified through hospital or mortality records, persons with &#x02265; 6 ACEs were roughly 13 years younger on average at presentation than those without ACEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adverse childhood experiences may be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly premature death from lung cancer.

An underlying thesis of the ACE Study is that stressful or traumatic childhood experiences have negative neurodevelopmental impacts that persist over the lifespan and that increase the risk of a variety of health and social problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Strong, graded relationships have been reported between traumatic stress during childhood and smoking behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Anda and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] hypothesized that observed associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and early smoking initiation (by age 14 years) as well as other smoking behaviours in adulthood may be partly explained by the adoption of smoking as a means of self-medicating to deal with affective disorders through the psychoactive actions of nicotine. The epidemiological findings parallel advances in the neurobiological understanding of tobacco dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] as well as that for the consequences of exposure to childhood traumatic stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], providing biologic plausibility to observed associations between child maltreatment and adverse health outcomes later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>For example, evidence from animal models, clinical studies, and neuroimaging studies suggest that child maltreatment affects brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex) and circuits such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and norepinephrine systems which mediate stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Early stressors may have lasting effects on the HPA axis perhaps by increasing glucocorticoid response to subsequent stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; that is to say, early life stressors may lead to sensitization of central nervous system corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, disruptions in HPA signaling may sustain inflammatory processes (processes shown to have a role in the development of some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]) through altered release of glucocorticoid hormones and disturbances in the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms thereby affecting immune activation and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The negative health consequences of smoking and second hand smoke exposure are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Smoking is responsible for at least 30% of all cancer deaths, for nearly 80% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as early cardiovascular disease and deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. An estimated 443,000 Americans die from diseases directly related to cigarette smoking each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and smoking is estimated to be responsible for more than 5 million deaths per year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Lung cancer, one of many smoking-related diseases for which evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship, is a leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States. In 2005, 90,141 men and 69,079 women died of lung cancer in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of this evidence, we conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the ACE Study and ACE Mortality Study to examine the cumulative effect(s) of ACEs on the risk of lung cancer with particular attention given to an important causal intermediate, smoking behaviour. The <italic>a priori </italic>hypothesis was that ACEs are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and that this relationship would operate through the ACE-smoking relationship.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Baseline cohort</title><p>The ACE Study methods have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The ACE Study has been approved by the institutional review boards of the respective institutions. Briefly, the ACE Study is based at Kaiser Permanente's San Diego Health Appraisal Clinic, a primary care clinic where each year more than 50,000 adult members of the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization receive an annual, standardized, biopsychosocial medical examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Each member who visits the Health Appraisal Clinic completes a standardized medical questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The medical history is completed by a health care provider who also performs a general physical examination and reviews laboratory test results with the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Appointments for most members are obtained by self-referral with 20% referred by their health care provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A review of Kaiser Permanente members aged 25 years or older in San Diego and continuously enrolled between 1992 and 1995 revealed that 81% of those members had been evaluated at the Health Appraisal Clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>All Kaiser members who completed medical examinations at the Health Appraisal Clinic between August and November of 1995, between January and March of 1996 (Wave I: 13,494 persons), and between April and October of 1997 (Wave II: 13,330 persons) were eligible to participate in the ACE Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Within two weeks after a member's visit to the Health Appraisal Clinic, a Study questionnaire was mailed asking questions about health behaviours and adverse childhood experiences. A total of 17,421 (68%) persons responded; 84 persons had incomplete information on race and educational attainment leaving 17,337 persons available in the baseline cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Eligible ACE Study participants with a "true" NDI record match were assumed to be dead, and those with no NDI record match or an NDI record match considered to be "false" match were assumed to be alive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Data map for mortality follow-up through 31 December 2005</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-10-20-1"/></fig><p>Of the 17,337 study participants at baseline, 10,542 were currently enrolled in the health plan on 31 December 2005 and assumed to be alive. The vital status of the remaining 6795 participants was unknown and therefore these participants were eligible for matching to the NDI.

A total of 436 observations were excluded from the follow-up cohort because the baseline appointment date occurred outside of a period of enrollment in the health plan or within 120 days of a period of enrollment.

Associations between the number of ACE categories and each of the five smoking behaviours were examined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, we estimated, by means of the odds ratio (OR), the relative risk of lung cancer occurrence during follow-up identified through hospitalization discharge records for each of the ACE score categories (1; 2; 3; 4 or 5; and 6, 7, or 8) compared to those without ACEs. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated, by means of the hazard rate ratio (HR), the relative risk of lung cancer occurrence during follow-up identified through death records across the number of categories of ACEs. We assessed the appropriateness of the proportional hazard assumption for the variables in our final model; without exception, all covariates in the final model satisfied the proportional hazard assumption.</p><p>Multivariable-adjusted models included age at baseline; sex; race/ethnicity (white, nonwhite); education (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate); marital status (married, unmarried), and current financial problems (yes, no). To assess relationships between ACEs and the occurrence of lung cancer after the addition of smoking (a causal intermediate), we included dichotomous variables for former smoking, current smoking of less than 20 cigarettes per day, and current smoking of 20 or more cigarettes per day (with never smokers as referent) as well as a measure of second hand smoke exposure (parental smoking during childhood). We also controlled for co-factors associated with an increased risk of lung cancer including a baseline history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, or tuberculosis.</p><p>Analysis focused on estimation of the risk of lung cancer rather than thinking in dichotomous terms of what is and is not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] as is done in predictive modeling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ACEs and Smoking Behaviour</title><p>Respondents who ever smoked were more likely to have reported experiencing the component ACEs than those who had never smoked (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Among those who died from lung cancer, persons with 6 or more ACEs died nearly 13 years earlier on average (62.0 years; 95%CI = 53.7-70.2) on average than those without ACEs (75.4 years; 95%CI = 73.0-77.8). We re-ran the models in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> after redefining the outcome as time to death from lung cancer at age 65 years or before (n = 10 deaths) and age 75 years or before (n = 55 deaths). Comparing persons with 6 or more ACEs to those without ACEs, risk ratios for the occurrence of lung cancer were 10.48 (95%CI = 1.94-56.64) (Model A, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and financial problems) and 7.90 (95%CI = 1.40-44.61) (Model B, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, financial problems, smoking status, parental smoking history) for death at age 65 or before; 4.72 (95%CI = 1.54-14.44) (Model A) and 2.90 (95%CI = 0.92-9.11) (Model B) for death at age 75 or before.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>Using prospective data we observed graded relationships between the ACE score and the risk of lung cancer. Moreover, relationships between a high ACE score and lung cancer were particularly strong for those who died from lung cancer at younger ages. The increase in risk of lung cancer was only partly due to relationships between ACEs and an intermediate causal factor, smoking. The occurrence of ACE-related lung cancer not attributable to conventional risk factors suggests other mechanisms by which childhood traumatic stressors negatively affect health.</p><p>The observed associations between ACEs and lung cancer may be conservative. Case fatality for lung cancer is high. The overall 5-year relative survival rate for 1996-2004 from 17 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) geographic areas in the United States was 15% (age &#x0003c;65 years, 18%; age &#x0003e;/=65 years, 13%) with a survival rate for small cell lung cancer of about 6% and for non-small cell of only 17% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, given relationships between ACEs and smoking behaviours (particularly associations with early smoking initiation) which would increase the probability of developing smoking-related disease, it is possible that some Kaiser members with higher ACE scores were less likely to survive and to be included in the baseline data collection because they had already died from lung cancer or another smoking-related disease.</p><p>Some degree of selection bias is inevitable in observational research simply because not all persons who are born will survive to the observation period of interest and because the population that does survive often differs from the population that does not. In the case of ACEs, which are associated with numerous adverse health behaviours and health outcomes (perhaps most importantly premature death), it is reasonable to postulate that persons who are exposed to ACEs (particularly multiple ACEs) are more likely than those who are not exposed to die during childhood or young adulthood, be institutionalized, or otherwise lost prior to the initiation of the ACE Study and baseline survey resulting in a downward bias for the association between ACEs and lung cancer. Some caution must be exercised in making such an assertion with regard to the direction of the bias since this does not always hold for non-dichotomous exposures.</p><p>A strength of this study lies in the use of two prospective data sources to identify cases of lung cancer. The prospective data from hospital and mortality records are not subject to recall bias and are reported by physicians who were unaware of the patient ACE score. Also, the ACE Study incorporates multiple forms of childhood traumatic stressors. Studies that examine only one or at most two types of stressors may <italic>1</italic>) underestimate the burden of exposure, <italic>2</italic>) fail to recognize the interrelationships between different types of traumatic stressors during childhood, and/or <italic>3</italic>) incorrectly attribute long-term consequences to single types of childhood traumatic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] despite convincing evidence suggesting that exposure to multiple forms of abuse and traumatic stressors appear to influence health behaviors and outcomes through a cumulative process.</p><p>The results of this study are subject to several limitations. The frequency of ACEs may represent an underreporting of their actual occurrence given the sensitive nature of the questions. However, our estimates of the prevalence of childhood exposures are similar to estimates from nationally representative surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] indicating that the experiences of our participants are comparable to those of the larger population of adults. For example, in our study we found that 16% of the men and 25% of the women met the case definition for contact sexual abuse; a national telephone survey of adults in US conducted by Finkelhor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] using similar criteria for sexual abuse estimated that 16% of men and 27% of women had been sexually abused. Of the men from our study, 30% had been physically abused as boys, which closely parallels the percentage (31%) found in a recent population-based study of Ontario men in Canada that used questions from the same scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The similarity in estimates of the prevalence of these childhood exposures between the ACE Study and other population-based studies suggests that our findings are likely to be applicable in other settings.</p><p>The adverse effects of smoking are in part a function of the amount smoked, duration of smoking, inhalation, and tobacco product smoked. While we were able to incorporate the amount smoked, this analysis did not have data on duration and therefore was not able to compute the number of pack-years smoked. Thus, associations between ACEs and the occurrence of lung cancer that remained after the addition of smoking into the model may be the result of our inability to capture pathway effects of smoking duration. Also, smoking status was based on a single measure at baseline; therefore, we do not have data on initiation or cessation during follow-up. Similarly, exposure to second hand smoke may have changed over time. While we included variables in the final model for baseline prevalent asthma, COPD, and tuberculosis - conditions associated with the occurrence of lung cancer - we did not have information on occupational or other environmental exposures (e.g., asbestos, radon).</p><p>ACEs are associated with risk factors for chronic disease conditions such as ischemic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] that may result in an increased risk of exacerbating underlying lung disease and/or negatively affect general health, leading to disease progression or perhaps increasing the likelihood of undiagnosed lung cancer being identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Although mortality follow-up was available for a maximum of 10 years, statistical power was somewhat limited owing to relatively few deaths during follow-up among persons exposed to multiple ACEs. We plan to continue repeating the NDI search and related analyses in the coming years. As is the case in many observational studies, there may have been unknown or unmeasured confounding factors for which adjustment was not possible. Moreover, measurement error in the assessment or estimation of covariates and their severity may have resulted in incomplete adjustment and residual confounding. We feel these data are compatible with a moderate association between ACEs and risk of lung cancer; however, this assumes that there is no bias in the data collected and that our statistical models are correct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we examined competing risks as a potential explanation for observed results using mortality data. If competing causes of loss to follow-up act independent of the outcome (e.g., lung cancer), then consistent estimates of the survival function are possible. Alternatively, if the independence assumption does not hold, a bias can be introduced because the number of failures from the competing risk may influence the number of subjects at risk for the outcome of interest. After identifying deaths during follow-up from smoking-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] (other than lung cancer) (n = 707 deaths) and removing these observations from the censored group, we repeated the models shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and observed similar results for risk of lung cancer death at any age as well as premature death from lung cancer.</p><p>In summary, exposure to adverse childhood experiences is common. Insofar as stressful and traumatic childhood experiences contribute to the adoption of adverse health behaviours, such as smoking, and subsequent development of poor health outcomes, such as death from lung cancer, these childhood exposures should be recognized as underlying causes of premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Reducing the burden of adverse childhood experiences should be considered in health and social programs as a means of primary prevention of lung cancer as well as other smoking-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In addition, because smoking did not completely explain observed relationships between ACEs and the occurrence of lung cancer, other pathophysiologic pathways by which childhood stressors may influence the risk of lung cancer should be explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Study conception and design: DWB, RFA.
