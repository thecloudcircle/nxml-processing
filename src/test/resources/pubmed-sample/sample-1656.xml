However, little is known regarding what regulates HDAC expression and therefore the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs during osteogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether mechanical loading regulates HDAC expression directly and examined the role of HDACs in mechanical loading-triggered osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. We first studied the microarrays of samples from patients with osteoporosis and found that the NOTCH pathway and skeletal development gene sets were downregulated in the BMSCs of patients with osteoporosis. Then we demonstrated that mechanical stimuli can regulate osteogenesis and bone formation both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. NOTCH signaling was upregulated during cyclic mechanical stretch (CMS)-induced osteogenic differentiation, whereas HDAC1 protein expression was downregulated. The perturbation of HDAC1 expression also had a significant effect on matrix mineralization and JAG1-mediated Notch signaling, suggesting that HDAC1 acts as an endogenous attenuator of Notch signaling in the mechanotransduction of BMSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay results suggest that HDAC1 modulates the CMS-induced histone H3 acetylation level at the JAG1 promoter. More importantly, we found an inhibitory role of Hdac1 in regulating bone formation in response to hindlimb unloading in mice, and pretreatment with an HDAC1 inhibitor partly rescued the osteoporosis caused by mechanical unloading. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that mechanical stimulation orchestrates genes expression involved in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via the direct regulation of HDAC1, and the therapeutic inhibition of HDAC1 may be an efficient strategy for enhancing bone formation under mechanical stimulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Osteoporosis is a debilitating bone disease that can occur when bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) fail to produce a sufficient number of osteoblasts to counteract bone resorption by osteoclasts.

During osteogenesis, total HDAC enzymatic activity is decreased, with a significant reduction in HDAC1 expression. Consistent with this finding, the recruitment of HDAC1 to the promoters of osteoblast marker genes, including osterix (Osx) and osteocalcin (Ocn), is downregulated, whereas histone H3 and H4 are hyperacetylated at those promoters during osteogenic differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Previous studies have also shown that the suppression of HDAC activity with HDAC inhibitors accelerates osteogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> However, little is known regarding what regulates HDAC expression during osteogenesis. In addition, the functional roles of HDACs in the mechanotransduction of BMSCs have not been well characterized and are, therefore, particularly interesting to study.</p><p>BMSCs are simultaneously exposed to chemical and mechanical cues. In this study, we found that HDAC1 was negatively correlated with osteogenic differentiation and bone formation in the BMSCs of patients with osteoporosis, whereas jagged 1 (JAG1)-mediated NOTCH signaling was upregulated. Specifically, mechanical loading directly induced a downregulation of HDAC1 expression, which was involved in the promotion of osteogenic differentiation and bone formation through the targeting of JAG1, a master inducer of osteogenic differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Our findings also demonstrate that the therapeutic inhibition of HDAC1 may partly rescue osteoporosis caused by mechanical unloading.

Genome-wide gene expression patterns were examined using microarray hybridizations (The microarrays were downloaded from the GEO database, GEO accession number GSE35958). Using the GSEA method, we found that the cell cycle checkpoint, Notch signaling pathway, and skeletal development gene sets were significantly enriched in the BMSCs from the control group (the NES scores and FDR values for the gene sets were 2.054, 0.008; 1.748, 0.004; and 2.003, 0.06, respectively) compared with the results from the primary osteoporosis group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). By generating a heat map for gene products that were differentially expressed by at least twofold in the BMSCs from the osteoporosis group relative to their expression in the BMSCs from the age-matched control group, we were able to highlight the differences between BMSCs from the osteoporosis and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Osteoporotic cells exhibited a distinct gene expression profile independent of cellular aging, in which the components from the NOTCH signaling pathway, JAG1, JAG2, NOTCH1, and NOTCH2, were downregulated, and the expression of their target gene, HES1, was also decreased. As skeletal development or bone formation activity, the markers of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, such as RUNX2, COL1a2, and BMPR1B, were decreased in the osteoporosis group. The expression of genes coding for enhancers of osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization (SPP1, ALPL, EFNB2, COL1A1, and ANKH) was also reduced (data shown by Benisch <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>). These results show that osteogenic differentiation and the related NOTCH signaling were impaired in the BMSCs of patients with osteoporosis.</p><p>To investigate the effects of mechanical loading that primarily regulate bone development <italic>in vivo</italic>, we adopted the HU mouse model, which has been widely used to simulate weightlessness and to study various aspects of musculoskeletal loading. For comparison with the effects of WB in the control group mice (WB, 6-month-old age-matched adult mice), HU mice were elevated by their tail for 28 days. Microcomputed tomography (microCT) showed that the bone volume of the tibial plateau in HU mice was significantly lower than that in WB mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c and d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanical stimulation orchestrates NOTCH signaling and HDACs in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs</title><p>We further analyzed the expression of Jag1-Notch signaling and Hdac genes in the BMSCs of the HU group. By isolating BMSCs from the WB and HU groups, we found that, without mechanical loading, the mRNA and protein expression of Notch1, Notch2, Jag1, Jag2, and their target genes Hes1 and Hey1 were all downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and b</xref>). Corresponding to the reduced Notch signaling, ALP staining and <italic>in vitro</italic> mineralization were also decreased in the HU group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These results show that osteogenic differentiation was diminished in the absence of mechanical stimulation. Although the markers of osteogenic differentiation (Alp, Ocn, collagen type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1), and Osx) were downregulated, the markers of adipogenic differentiation (PPAR<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>), aP2, Glut4) were significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2d and e</xref>) in the HU group. The mRNA and protein expression of class I Hdacs (Hdac1, Hdac2, Hdac3) was enhanced, but the expression of class II Hdacs (Hdac5) was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f and g</xref>). However, no evident differences in proliferation were found between the two groups after mechanical loading/unloading for 3 weeks in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how mechanical loading regulates osteogenic differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we developed the CMS-induced osteogenic differentiation model of human BMSCs. After loading for 3 weeks, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of the osteogenic marker genes ALP, OCN, and COL1a1 was increased in the CMS group compared with their expression in the non-loading control cells (Ctrl group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), which was confirmed by the results of the western blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Consistent with the above changes, 10&#x00025; CMS treatment also enhanced ALP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> mineralization, as assessed by Alizarin red staining of mineralized deposits in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These results show that CMS treatment enhances the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Using immunofluorescence, we found an increased expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and nucleus-accumulated RUNX2 after CMS for 3 days, which indicates the activation of NOTCH signaling and osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Moreover, CMS also promoted the mRNA and protein expression of the ligand for the NOTCH receptor JAG1 and the downstream genes of the NOTCH signaling pathway HES1 and HEY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3f&#x02013;h</xref>). The protein and mRNA levels of HDAC1 were markedly decreased after CMS for 2 weeks, but no significant difference was observed after CMS for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). To confirm the role of JAG1 in osteogenesis, we inhibited JAG1 using a specific siRNA in the CMS-induced osteogenic differentiation model in human BMSCs, and we found that the CMS-induced mRNA and protein expression of JAG1 and the osteogenic markers COL1a1 and OCN were blocked by JAG1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). The CMS-promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was also reduced by JAG1 inhibition, as shown by the <italic>in vitro</italic> mineralization results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). All of our results demonstrate that mechanical stimulation promotes the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by activating JAG1-mediated pro-osteogenic Notch signaling and reducing the expression of HDAC1.</p></sec><sec><title>HDAC1 modulates JAG1-Notch signaling during CMS-induced osteogenic differentiation</title><p>Next we examined whether there was a connection between the increased JAG1 expression and the decreased HDAC1 expression during CMS-induced osteogenesis, as acetylation of histones has been implicated in the activation of transcription. Previous studies have shown that suppression of HDAC activity using HDAC inhibitors accelerates osteogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> To clarify the role of HDAC1 in regulating CMS-induced osteogenesis, we treated human BMSCs with an HDAC1 inhibitor or caused them to overexpress HDAC1. First, we inhibited HDAC1 using a specific siRNA in the CMS-induced osteogenic differentiation model. Without effecting JAG1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4e and f</xref>), we found that the CMS-induced expression of the osteogenic markers ALP, COL1a1, and OCN were enhanced by HDAC1 siRNA treatment, which was further supported by the ALP staining results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated the influence of HDAC1 on the expression of the JAG1-NOTCH signaling pathway and, therefore, on osteogenesis. We found that the CMS-activated mRNA and protein expression of JAG1, HES1, and HEY1 were facilitated by HDAC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4h and i</xref>). Interestingly, as shown by the <italic>in vitro</italic> mineralization assay, CMS-activated osteogenesis was enhanced by HDAC1 inhibition. However, this enhancement by HDAC1 inhibition was significantly blocked by an inhibitor of NOTCH signaling transduction (10&#x02009;nM RO4929097, an inhibitor of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> secretase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). Moreover, we then investigated whether the observed pro-osteogenic effects of HDAC1 inhibition were related to changes in histone acetylation in the promoter regions in human BMSCs. A ChIP analysis was performed using antibodies to pan-acetylated histone H3 and four designed primers for JAG1 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We identified a significant increase in the histone H3 acetylation level at the JAG1 promoter after CMS treatment for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5b and c</xref>). HDAC1 inhibition promoted the elevated H3 acetylation level at the JAG1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p>Second, we overexpressed HDAC1 in human BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) and found that this significantly reduced ALP and COL1a1 transcription and the level of the late osteoblast marker OCN under mechanical stimulation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). ALP assays and Alizarin red staining for mineralized deposits showed that HDAC1 overexpression significantly abrogated the CMS-induced increase in ALP activity and mineralized deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5g and h</xref>). Furthermore, the CMS-induced expression of JAG1, HES1, and HEY1 were also blocked by HDAC1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5i and j</xref>). Consistent with the above results, the CMS-enhanced histone H3 acetylation level at the JAG1 promoter was apparently decreased by the induction of HDAC1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>). Overall, these results confirm that CMS can induce osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by activating pro-osteogenic JAG1-Notch signaling, which is facilitated by increased histone H3 acetylation levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of HDAC1 rescued the decrease of bone formation in the HU mouse model</title><p>To investigate the function of HDAC1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a HU mouse model. MicroCT showed that mechanical unloading-induced bone loss was partly rescued by HDAC1 inhibition (valproic acid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), and bone volume analysis revealed that the bone volume-related parameters were partly increased by HDAC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Similarly, the assessment of bone formation indicated by green fluorescent calcein showed that the mechanical unloading-induced decrease in bone formation was rescued by HDAC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c and d</xref>). Furthermore, a histological assessment after 28 days of HU demonstrated that, compared with staining in the WB group, the bone staining of the HU group was significantly decreased, with intensified adipose tissue staining. The overall area of stained bone was increased in the HU group treated with an HDAC1 inhibitor, which indicates that the impaired development of new bone was rescued by HDAC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that osteogenic differentiation and Notch signaling are impaired in the BMSCs of patients with osteoporosis and in HU mice. In addition, mechanical stimulation promotes the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by, at least in part, activating JAG1-mediated pro-osteogenic Notch signaling and reducing the expression of HDAC1. Finally, the therapeutic inhibition of HDAC1 was able to partly counteract the bone loss observed in HU mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding how MSCs sense and respond to applied forces is an area of intense research. Numerous cell membrane proteins have been identified in mechano-sensing mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Cadherins, which bind cells to adjacent cells, have also been found to anchor themselves by forming complexes with catenins, which bind directly to the cytoskeleton. Mechanical loading inhibits the binding of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin to E-cadherin and increases the cytoplasmic pool of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> The decrease of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin binding is coupled with Akt and GSK3<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> activation. Therefore, cadherins may serve as mechano-sensors and may be a promising target for future mechanical loading studies. The expression of Notch, a cell-surface receptor that transduces short-range signals by interacting with transmembrane ligands such as Delta (termed Delta-like in humans) and Serrate (termed Jagged in humans) on neighboring cells, had not yet been studied under mechanical stimulation conditions. Notch signaling is a key mechanism in the control of stem cell differentiation and embryogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Notch signaling components, especially JAG1 and NOTCH-2, are upregulated during both endochondral and intramembranous bone regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> JAG1 is variably mutated in Alagille syndrome patients with skeletal defects and poor bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> In addition, JAG1 has been identified as a gene associated with osteoporosis in a GWAS analysis, and a recently identified Jag1-null mutation is responsible for the development of osteogenesis imperfecta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Studies have also found that JAG1-activated Notch signaling is sufficient to induce human MSC osteogenesis, increasing osteogenic marker genes, such as ALP and BSP, and enhancing ALP activity and tissue mineralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the clinical and genetic evidence suggesting that JAG1 may positively regulate bone mass in humans, there is a paucity of data from studies exploring the role of JAG1 in human osteogenesis under mechanical loading. For the first time, our results show that Jag1 and Notch signaling were decreased in the BMSCs of hindlimb-unloaded mice and that JAG1-activated NOTCH signaling in human BMSCs was upregulated by CMS <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, JAG1 and Notch signaling had an important role in mediating the mechanical-triggered osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, which was blocked by inhibitors of the NOTCH signaling pathways. However, we also observed that CMS modulated JAG1 expression by modifying the histone acetylation status of JAG1, as the inhibition of HDAC1 only partially rescued the mechanical unloading-induced osteoporosis in mice. This suggests that CMS may also directly induce JAG1 expression by activating mechano-sensitive transcription factors, such as <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin, and change the epigenetic modifications of the JAG1 promoter region to promote its transcription. NOTCH signaling and JAG1 expression were both impaired because of the loss of mechanical loading, but they may also be affected by the loss of miscellaneous biochemical or spatial structural signals that occurs in osteoporosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. This topic deserves in-depth studies to determine how BMSCs orchestrate the biochemical and mechanical signals involved in this process and which signal is the main factor in controlling osteogenic differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Stem cell differentiation is extremely sensitive to epigenetic changes. The application of epigenetic regulators, such as inhibitors of histone-modification enzymes, may be valuable for stem cell-based interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> HDAC inhibitors have been demonstrated to enhance osteogenic differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and new bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Previous studies have shown that the suppression of HDAC activity with HDAC inhibitors accelerates osteogenesis by inducing osteoblast marker genes, including osteopontin and ALP.

Shear stress can modulate chromatin remodeling on histone H3 and H4, resulting in eNOS being regulated by chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms at the transcriptional level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Zeng <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> demonstrated that laminar flow increased the activity of HDACs and the association of p53 with HDAC1, leading to the deacetylation of p53 in ECs.

However, the potential of the mechanical environment to regulate DNA methylation or histone modifications has seldom been examined in BMSCs, which is fundamental to understanding stem cell mechanobiology. Arnsdorf <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> demonstrated that mechanical stimulation altered the epigenetic state of osteogenic genes (Ocn, Opn, and Col1) by reducing DNA methylation and showed that this was associated with an increase in expression.

For the first time, we found that mechanical loading downregulated HDAC1 and, therefore, facilitated JAG1 expression and the osteogenesis of BMSCs. Furthermore, we also found increased Hdac1 expression and downregulated Jag1-Notch signaling in a mechanical unloading-induced osteoporotic mouse model. The inhibition of Hdac1 by a specific siRNA or small-molecule inhibitor promoted osteogenesis and rescued bone loss in mechanically unloaded mice. Consistent with the above-mentioned reported results, our results confirmed that mechanical cues can directly modulate the epigenetic modification status of osteogenic genes and, therefore, promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.</p><p>Several studies have indicated that mechanical force has an important role in regulating cell growth and proliferation, and an appropriate mechanical stretch treatment could promote the proliferative capacity of BMSCs. Song <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> found that the proliferation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was significantly elevated after exposure to a 1-Hz stretch stimulation within 15&#x02013;60&#x02009;min at an 8&#x00025; strain. However, Zuo <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> found that 8&#x00025; CMS had no significant influence on cell viability during 24&#x02013;72&#x02009;h. The effect of long-term (&#x0003e;3 weeks) continuous mechanical stretching on the proliferation of MSCs has not been previously studied. Luu <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> found that 6 weeks of low-magnitude mechanical signals (0.2&#x02009;g, 90-Hz signal applied for 15&#x02009;min/day, 5 day/week) increased the overall marrow-based stem cell population by 37&#x00025; and the number of MSCs by 46&#x00025;. Concomitant with the increase in stem cell number, the differentiation potential of MSCs in the bone marrow was biased toward osteogenic and against adipogenic differentiation. In our study, we found that without mechanical loading, the proliferation of BMSCs was unchanged after 3 weeks. There are many studies that have shown mechanical stimulation to have no effect on cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> or to reduce MSC proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> These mixed findings can most likely be explained by the diversity of conditions in the experiments, including the specific mechanical stimulation, MSC species, and culture media used, as well as the wide range of loading parameters used.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study provides new findings that mechanical stimulation orchestrates gene expression for the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via directly regulating HDAC1. HDAC1 functions through inhibiting its direct target, JAG1, which is the master regulator of osteogenesis, at the transcription level. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modifiers such as HDACs in regulating MSC lineage determination under mechanical stimulation is pivotal for understanding bone cell differentiation and diseases. These findings not only provide new insights into mechano-response signaling pathways but also raise intriguing possibilities for the use of HDAC modulators to regulate bone formation in regenerative medicine. We anticipate that our study will provide a foundation for future investigations on the development of gene therapies for treating human bone remodeling disorders related to mechanical loading, such as osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Bone marrow cells from the tibias and femurs of mice and the posterior iliac crests of healthy adult human donors (17&#x02013;35 years of age), collected with informed consent, were flushed out with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-Minimum Essential Medium (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MEM, Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) and cultured in growth medium (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MEM with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (Gibco by Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 1&#x00025; penicillin and streptomycin (Hyclone)) at 37&#x000b0; in the presence of 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> following the lysis of red blood cells.
