Studies conducted in urban areas of Uganda have shown good therapeutic outcomes in HIV-infected adults treated with ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, little is known about immunovirological treatment outcomes, likelihood of achieving therapeutic plasmatic concentrations of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, and adherence to treatment of patients treated using a simplified management approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] in rural areas of developing countries. Also, risk factors for virological failure have not been extensively investigated.</p><p>Rural programs face numerous challenges concerning HIV care and treatment in Africa, including lack of appropriate tools to diagnose common opportunistic infections and qualified human resources. The scale-up of ART in recent years has not necessarily been accompanied by an increased strengthening of health systems, and this disparity is likely to negatively affect the quality of care in HIV/AIDS programs.</p><p>The main objective of this study was to describe clinical and immunovirological response to ART, patients' self-reported adherence, and plasma levels of ARV in HIV-infected adults who received free World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended ARV drug regimens as fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) for 12 or 24 months in Arua, a rural area in northern Uganda. Furthermore, we investigated potential risk factors for virological failure and for subtherapeutic concentrations of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) or protease inhibitors (PI).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Since 2002, M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res (MSF) in collaboration with the Ugandan Ministry of Health has provided ART free of charge in the regional referral hospital of Arua. The program initially served the whole West Nile region, but decentralization of patients on ART to other district and missionary hospitals was started in 2004. Eligibility criteria for ART are those recommended in the WHO guidelines for scaling up ART in resource-poor settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Patients are seen by nurses monthly or every 3 months for drug refills and to assess ARV drug toxicity; and by clinical officers every 2 or 6 months. CD4 T-cell counts are currently monitored at ART start (for patients with no WHO clinical stage 4 conditions) and every 6 months (yearly after the first year on ART since 2005). No routine viral load (VL) monitoring is performed.</p><p>Data routinely collected using standardized forms and entered into the FUCHIA software (Epicentre, Paris) were, at program inclusion, date of birth or age, and history of ARV use; and at ART start, date, regimen, clinical WHO conditions diagnosed, weight, height, and CD4 T-cell counts. By November 2005, approximately 8,000 patients were followed in the program, 90% of them were adults, and 45% were alive and followed on ART.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Before the start of the study (November 2005), we identified patients included in two observational open cohorts of HIV-infected patients who initiated ART in the previous 12 &#x000b1; 2 months (M12 cohort) and 24 &#x000b1; 2 months (M24 cohort). Patients found to be alive and still on ART were eligible for participation in a cross-sectional survey if they were contacted within the study window period, were non-pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of the study, and provided written informed consent. The study sample size was calculated assuming that 16% (M12) and 20% (M24) of these patients, respectively, would have detectable VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Two self-reported indicators of adherence were calculated: the percentage of pills taken in the last 4 days (number of pills taken as a proportion of the total number of pills prescribed); and the percentage of reported adherence in the last 30 days using a 6-point visual analogue scale (30-day VAS). Good adherence was defined as a value &#x02265; 95% pills or a VAS score &#x0003e;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Plasma concentrations of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), and nelfinavir (NFV) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] on blood samples collected 12 hours after ingestion of the last dose of ARV.

Estimates of retention in care appear to be more favorable than those reported during the early years of the Drug Access Initiative (DAI) program among individuals treated in urban hospitals of Kampala, where patients were requested to pay the care fees (49&#x02013;56% at 1 year, and 46% at 2 years of ART) and more than 30% were ARV-experienced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Like in other African settings, most of our patients started treatment at an advanced stage of HIV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which partly explains why a considerable proportion of patients had low CD4 cell counts after 1 or 2 years of therapy. As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], early mortality in our cohorts was high with 88% of deaths occurring in the first 6 months of follow-up under ART. Delays in access to care (&#x0003e;80% of patients started treatment at an advanced clinical stage of HIV disease), delayed diagnosis and treatment of severe opportunistic infections (e.g. TB), undiagnosed severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes, and nutritional deficiencies might have contributed to this increased early mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Despite the frequency of clinical intolerances reported, the initial ART regimen was well tolerated, and few cases of severe (grades 3 or 4) laboratory-based toxicity were diagnosed. Self-reported adherence at 12 and 24 months of ART was high and similar to that reported in other studies, both in resource-limited countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], with a higher proportion of patients reporting good adherence in the M24 cohort than the M12 cohort (90% compared with 80%, respectively). Although reported adherence is subject to measurement error and we cannot exclude that some patients over-reported their level of adherence to ART during the survey, these findings were consistent with plasmatic ARV pharmacological measurements obtained in the same patients. However, the reported levels of adherence do not necessarily reflect patient's compliance throughout the duration of treatment.</p><p>The observed immune and virological responses at 1 and 2 years of ART were similar to those reported in other African settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, more than 35% of patients had a CD4 count &#x0003c;200 cells/ml and were therefore at increased risk of death due to occurrence of opportunistic diseases. In the M12 cohort, undetectable VL was achieved by 75% of the patients, and 89% had a VL &#x0003c;1,000 copies/ml. In Malawi, 87% of the patients receiving a 2 NRTI/1 NNRTI-based regimen had a VL &#x0003c;1,000 copies/ml after a median of 10 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The DART study conducted in Zimbabwe and Uganda reported that 72% of patients who received AZT/3TC/TDF for a year had undetectable VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Also, in a teaching hospital of Kampala, undetectable VL was observed in 86% of patients treated with d4T/3TC/NVP for 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similarly, in a patient cohort in Khayelitsha, South Africa, 70% of patients achieved undetectable VL at 1 year of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In our M24 cohort, undetectable VL was achieved by 71% of the patients. Lower virological success rates have been reported in four urban clinics in Senegal, C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire, Uganda, and Kenya after 2 years of ART (40&#x02013;69% had a VL &#x0003c;400 copies/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Overall, 7% of patients with virological failure at M12 and 13% at M24 had resistant virus, which is similar to estimates reported for patients treated with 2 NRTI/1 NNRTI-based therapy in east Africa or South-east Asia after more than 9 months of treatment (9&#x02013;18%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This figure might be underestimated if patients with unsuppressed HIV VL (400&#x02013;999 copies/ml) but not virological failure also had viral mutations conferring resistance to therapy. More conservative estimates of prevalence of resistance would therefore be 18% and 21% of M12 and M24 patients, respectively, on treatment.</p><p>Estimates of resistance and virological and immunological failure might also have been underestimated if some of the deaths or patients who were lost to follow-up died as a result of treatment failure and resistance. However, most deaths and losses to follow-up occurred within the first months of therapy when the likelihood of treatment failure was lower. Conversely, because our study is based on outcome data collected at a single time point and no confirmation of laboratory data was obtained in the following weeks, we might have slightly overestimated rates of virological and immunological failure due to measurement errors or to individual temporal variability in biological markers (e.g. HIV viral blips). As in previous studies conducted in patients using primarily d4T/3TC/NVP, the most commonly observed resistance mutations were those associated with the use of NNRTIs (K103N) and 3TC (M184V) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and none of the isolated viruses had mutations conferring resistance to the new NNRTIs (etravirine).</p><p>Patients on ART for 2 years were twice as likely as those on 1 year treatment to develop virological failure. Patients diagnosed with TB after ART initiation were also more likely to fail therapy, suggesting that patients' virological response could be impaired when rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment is initiated while a patient is under ART. The potential interaction between NVP and rifampicin in HIV-infected patients treated for TB has been reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This can result in subtherapeutic NVP plasma concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and favor the development of resistance to this drug. Alternatively, pill burden associated with concomitant treatments could lead to decreased adherence to one or both regimens.</p><p>Early identification of patients with virological failure and switch to second-line therapy is important to prevent the accumulation of resistance that might compromise the effectiveness of subsequent lines of treatment. In this program where virological monitoring of patients is not routinely performed, patients presenting general clinical symptoms, those with a weight loss below the value observed at therapy initiation, or those reporting poor adherence were more likely to have virological failure. The association between high VL levels and subtherapeutic NNRTI concentrations has been previously reported in Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and Cambodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], highlighting the importance of maintaining and reinforcing patients' adherence over time. In our study, patients severely immunosuppressed at the time of the survey were not more likely to have virological failure, although this might change if patients remain in a failing regimen for longer periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The pharmacological assessment showed increased plasmatic levels of NNRTI in 23% of patients on NVP-based therapy and 39% of those on EFV. These figures are higher than what has been described in Western countries, and are likely to be related to the lower weight of our patients at ART initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] compared with European patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In contrast, subtherapeutic levels of NVP and EFV were found in 15% and 2% of the patients, respectively. As in previous studies, the risk of having low NNRTI concentrations in plasma was nearly 4 times higher in patients with poor self-reported adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We also found a higher risk of subtherapeutic ARV levels in patients who reported digestive disorders at the time of the survey. Vomiting, malabsorption, or misclassification bias (e.g. if patients who reported symptoms were also more likely to report poor adherence) could contribute to explain this finding.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, in this HIV/AIDS care program implemented in a rural African setting using a simplified scale-up approach and free generic ART, survival and retention in care were satisfactory at up to 2 years of therapy, but efforts to increase earlier access to treatment and to improve patient management and support to achieve better immunological and virological outcomes on ART remain necessary to prolong patient survival. Early identification of poor adherence during follow-up, especially in the presence of intolerance to ARV and when TB treatment is provided, should be considered to maximize the duration of first-line therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LA designed and implemented the study, analyzed and managed data, interpreted results, and wrote the manuscript.
