However, the C797S mutation, which impairs the covalent binding between the cysteine residue at position 797 of EGFR and osimertinib, induces resistance to osimertinib. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the C797S/T790M/activating-mutation (triple-mutation)-mediated EGFR&#x02013;TKI resistance. In the present study, we identify brigatinib to be effective against triple-mutation-harbouring cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our original computational simulation demonstrates that brigatinib fits into the ATP-binding pocket of triple-mutant EGFR. The structure&#x02013;activity relationship analysis reveals the key component in brigatinib to inhibit the triple-mutant EGFR. The efficacy of brigatinib is enhanced markedly by combination with anti-EGFR antibody because of the decrease of surface and total EGFR expression. Thus, the combination therapy of brigatinib with anti-EGFR antibody is a powerful candidate to overcome triple-mutant EGFR.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>Resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer is mediated by the C797S/T790M/activating mutation.

The importance of treatment with the appropriate molecularly targeted drugs in driver oncogene-positive NSCLC has been increasingly recognized.

The acquired resistance against the first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib has been revealed to be mainly caused by a gatekeeper mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> involving substitution of threonine at position 790 with methionine (T790M), which hampers the binding of the EGFR&#x02013;TKI to the ATP-binding site of EGFR and accounts for 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; of resistant cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Many clinical trials of various agents to overcome the acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib were tried but failed to show any clinical advantage, except for one trial in which afatinib&#x0002b;cetuximab achieved a response rate of 29&#x00025; (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Despite its efficacy, this combination treatment has not been used in the clinical setting because of its relatively severe toxicity. To resolve this difficult situation, covalently binding third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs selectively targeting T790M have been evaluated for the treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Osimertinib, which was reported to be efficacious in T790M mutation-positive EGFR-mutated NSCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, has been approved in the US and other countries. J&#x000e4;nne <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> reported that in a phase 1/2 trial of osimertinib, among 127 patients with confirmed EGFR T790M who could be evaluated, the response rate was 61&#x00025; and the median progression-free survival was 9.6 months, which is as long as that of first-line EGFR&#x02013;TKIs for EGFR-mutated lung cancer.</p><p>Approval of osimertinib will influence the treatment tactics for EGFR-mutated lung cancer, but, again, resistance to osimertinib will be a major obstacle. In 2015, various mechanisms of the acquired resistance against osimertinib were independently published by several groups. An EGFR mutation involving substitution of cysteine at position 797 with serine (C797S) was detected in cell-free plasma DNA from osimertinib-refractory patients and was shown to induce osimertinib resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Ercan <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> reported that Ba/F3 cells with three amino acid substitutions, L844V, L718Q and C797S, found using the <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea mutagenesis method, are totally refractory to the third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs WZ-4002, osimertinib and CO-1686. In cases without the C797S mutation, although loss of T790M was reported as specific resistant mechanism to third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs, bypass pathway activation, such as c-MET activation or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation, in resistant tumours is thought to be the mechanism of resistance similar to that known in first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Indeed, <italic>HER2</italic> amplification, <italic>Met</italic> amplification, <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation and SCLC transformation have been observed in osimertinib-resistant cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to overcome the resistance to the third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs.</p><p>The osimertinib resistance due to the loss of T790M or bypass pathway activation is expected to be overcome using existing methods, for example, exchange to or addition of a first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKI or concurrent combination therapy of an inhibiting alternative pathway, respectively. However, we now have no clinically available strategy to conquer the C797S/T790M/activating-mutation (triple-mutation). Recently, Jia <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> published a unique allosteric EGFR inhibitor that can overcome the EGFR&#x02013;TKI resistance by EGFR-C797S/T790M/L858R mutation, but not EGFR-C797S/T790M/del19-mediated resistance by treating in combination with cetuximab. Niederst <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> investigated the emergence of the C797S allele and found that if C797S developed <italic>in trans</italic> of the T790M allele, a combination of first- and third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs may be effective enough for clinical use; however, when the C797S and T790M mutations developed <italic>in cis</italic>, all sensitivity to any of the existing EGFR&#x02013;TKIs, including the third-generation ones, was lost. However, we currently have no information on whether the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy of the combination of first- and third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs for <italic>trans</italic> C797S is clinically reproducible. The C797S mutations found in the samples obtained from participants in the osimertinib trial mentioned above were all <italic>in cis</italic> alleles except for one case of <italic>in trans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The frequency of resistance caused by C797S emergence is not well known because of the small number of third-generation-resistant patients, but the importance of developing treatment strategies for this group will be increasing in the near future as more and more patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC will be receiving osimertinib.</p><p>To investigate the therapeutic strategies for treating patients with triple-mutant EGFR, we performed drug screening and found brigatinib to be the promising candidate against triple-mutant EGFR with less potency against wild-type EGFR according to the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. Structure&#x02013;activity relationship analysis and computational simulation reveal the key component determining the affinity and the binding mode to triple-mutant EGFR that are expected to attribute to the future development. Finally, the combination with anti-EGFR antibody strikingly reduces the IC<sub>50</sub> of brigatinib and prolongs the survival of the triple-mutant EGFR xenograft-bearing mice. These findings in this study may help overcome acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Drug resistance by EGFR-C797S/T790M/activating mutations</title><p>Currently, there are four EGFR&#x02013;TKIs available in the clinical setting&#x02014;gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib and osimertinib. Gefitinib and erlotinib are so-called first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs that were proven to be efficacious for NSCLC harbouring an EGFR mutation (EGFR-activating mutation; exon 19 deletion [del19] or L858R point mutation in exon 21 [L858R]). Afatinib is a second-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKI irreversibly targeting the pan-HER signal pathway. Osimertinib and EGF-816 are third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs that covalently bind to EGFR and are effective against the T790M-mutated EGFR, the most common mechanism of acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs. EGF-816 is not yet accessible except for clinical trials. All classes of EGFR&#x02013;TKIs are active against the EGFR-activating mutation alone. Therefore, we evaluated the sensitivity of the EGFR&#x02013;TKI-resistant mutations introduced into Ba/F3 cells (T790M/activating mutation or C797S/T790M/activating mutation (triple-mutation)) to the clinically relevant EGFR&#x02013;TKIs gefitinib, afatinib, osimertinib and EGF-816.</p><p>The CellTiter-Glo assay showed that gefitinib and afatinib were effective against the EGFR-activating mutation, as previously described, and also potent against the double mutation with C797S, which is the covalent binding site of the second- and third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>). However, they are no longer effective against the T790M gatekeeper mutation, the most relevant mechanism of resistance to the first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs. Osimertinib and EGF-816 showed efficacy not only against the EGFR-activating mutation alone but also against the double mutation with T790M <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Although the resistance due to the T790M mutation has been shown to be overcome by the third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs, they lost their inhibitory activity when the C797S mutation occurred concurrent with the T790M <italic>in cis</italic>. The Ba/F3 cells expressing the triple-mutant EGFR were entirely resistant to all generations of EGFR&#x02013;TKIs with similar IC<sub>50</sub> values as in the parental Ba/F3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g&#x02013;i</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1a,b</xref>). We examined the sensitivity of PC9 cells (parental; expressing del19 alone) and resistant PC9 cells (T790M; double mutation del19 with T790M, triple-mutant; generated by introducing C797S/T790M/del19 (triple-del19) mutant EGFR) to the EGFR&#x02013;TKIs to confirm the characteristics demonstrated in Ba/F3 cells. The CellTiter-Glo assay revealed similar results in the PC9 triple-mutant cells that were also refractory to all EGFR&#x02013;TKIs as seen in Ba/F3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1c</xref>). Interestingly, PC9 triple-mutant cells showed no sensitivity to the combination therapy of gefitinib and osimertinib that was shown to overcome the acquired osimertinib resistance mediated by C797S and T790M mutations <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). These results suggest that no clinically beneficial drug is available for the treatment of the triple-mutant EGFR.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Brigatinib overcomes the resistance of EGFR-triple-mutant</title><p>To investigate the candidates who could overcome the triple-mutant EGFR, we performed a focused drug screening to examine their efficacy against each type of EGFR-del19 mutation in Ba/F3 cells using the CellTiter-Glo assay. The 30 drugs used in the focused drug screening comprised not only EGFR&#x02013;TKIs but also kinase inhibitors targeting other tyrosine kinases or serine/threonine kinases that are now available clinically or are being evaluated in clinical trials, referring to the report by Duong-Ly <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> that showed the potential to repurpose inhibitors against disease-associated or drug-resistant mutant kinases. Among TKIs, only brigatinib and ponatinib were expected to have inhibitory activity against EGFR-triple-del19 with &#x0223c;50&#x00025; growth inhibition at 100&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, the potency of ponatinib against triple-del19 assessed by the CellTiter-Glo assay was disappointing with almost the same IC<sub>50</sub> value as that in the parental Ba/F3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We then evaluated the efficacy of brigatinib in T790M/del19 and triple-del19-mutated EGFR-expressing Ba/F3 cells using the CellTiter-Glo assay compared with other clinically available EGFR&#x02013;TKIs. The assay demonstrated that only brigatinib inhibited the growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing the triple-del19 mutation with a low IC<sub>50</sub> (&#x0003c;100&#x02009;nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The addition of IL-3 as an original survival signalling pathway activator counteracted this inhibitory effect of brigatinib. The potency of brigatinib in triple-del19 was confirmed by western blotting that showed decreased phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signalling pathway in a dose-dependent manner in contrast to the lack of inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation by afatinib and osimertinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Although brigatinib showed acceptable inhibitory activity in cell growth inhibition and EGFR signal pathway also in Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR-del19 alone, T790M/del19 or C797S/del19, its efficacy was only superior to that of osimertinib against C797S/del19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The cell growth inhibition assay and western blotting using same setting of EGFR&#x02013;TKIs in Ba/F3 cells expressing mutant EGFR activated by L858R (L858R alone, T790M/L858R, C797S/L858R and C797S/T790M/L858R (triple-L858R)) showed that brigatinib was also effective in EGFR-L858R series but was less potent than in del19, with similar pattern of efficacy observed in Ba/F3 cells expressing corresponding mutation types of EGFR activated by del19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate whether or not brigatinib acts on EGFR through ATP competition, and to compare its activity between triple-mutant EGFR and wild-type EGFR, an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed using an ADP-Glo kit. The kinase activity inhibition curves demonstrated by this assay shifted with the ATP concentrations in both the triple-mutant and wild-type EGFR, indicating that brigatinib competitively affected the ATP-binding site of the EGFR kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The higher potency of brigatinib to triple-mutant EGFR was confirmed by the IC<sub>50</sub> value calculated for 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ATP, which was &#x0223c;10 times lower for triple-L858R than for the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, brigatinib showed less inhibitory activity to the cell lines without EGFR mutation than afatinib and osimertinib when compared with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of each drugs, especially in the wild-type EGFR-amplified A431 cells. In the KRAS-mutated A549 or H460 cells, all these inhibitors had high IC<sub>50</sub> values. From these results, brigatinib was expected to have a preferable toxicity profile related to wild-type EGFR inhibition compared with afatinib or even osimertinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a&#x02013;c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The activity of other ALK inhibitors with similar structure</title><p>As brigatinib was developed as a next-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)&#x02013;TKI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, we then investigated several ALK&#x02013;TKIs with similar structures&#x02014;AP26113-analog, AZD3463, TAE684, ceritinib and ASP3026 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Cell growth inhibition experiments using the CellTiter-Glo assay demonstrated that brigatinib and AP26113-analog had similar potency against the triple mutation with IC<sub>50</sub> values of &#x0003c;100&#x02009;nM, whereas AZD3463 was moderately active followed by TAE684 and two other drugs that showed no activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a&#x02013;d</xref>). The differences in efficacy between these drugs in cell growth inhibition were reproduced in western blotting experiments showing that brigatinib and AP26113-analog more effectively suppressed phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signalling pathway in cells expressing all types of EGFR mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7e,f</xref>). These experiments also suggested that L858R tends to be less sensitive to inhibitors than del19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 8,9</xref>). Comparison of the chemical structures of the ALK&#x02013;TKIs suggested that some functional groups have a key role in increasing the binding affinity to the triple-mutant EGFR. First, the phosphine oxide group in brigatinib and AP26113-analog, but not the isopropylsulfonyl group in TAE684, ceritinib and ASP3026, might contribute to their greater activity against the triple-mutant EGFR. Second, the presence of an isopropoxy group in ceritinib but no methoxy group in other ALK&#x02013;TKIs and the absence of chloride in ASP3026 might work as negative factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In silico</italic> simulation of brigatinib binds to triple-mutant EGFR</title><p>We performed the <italic>in silico</italic> docking simulation and molecular dynamic simulation to assess the binding compatibility between brigatinib and the triple-L858R mutant EGFR and to clarify whether the efficacy of brigatinib against the triple-mutant EGFR depends on targeting of the ATP-binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). In our simulations, brigatinib fitted into the ATP-binding pocket of EGFR-triple-L858R without sterically crowding T790M or C797S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>), forming two hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of M793 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Further, the ligand-binding conformation in the docked complex model was quite similar to that in the crystal structure of EML4-ALK bound to TAE684 (PDB-ID: 2XB7). This finding is considered to be reasonable because of high similarities between both protein and chemical structures of the two inhibitors. Although these structural analyses suggest that these two inhibitors were presumed to bind to EGFR with similar orientations, activity to triple-mutant EGFR significantly differed from each other in cell growth inhibition or western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,e</xref>). For explanation of the difference in the inhibitory activities, the docking model hinted advantageous substructures in brigatinib for EGFR binding. In the docked EGFR&#x02013;brigatinib model, the phosphine oxide group fully occupies the triphosphate-binding space in the ATP-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), concomitantly with meaningful gains of the electrostatic or van der Waals interaction energy for all atoms in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>), suggesting specific interaction with EGFR. In the case of TAE684, its substitution with the isopropylsulfonyl group might disturb the intermolecular interaction pattern and explain the superiority of brigatinib to TAE684 for triple mutation shown in this study. This interaction map between brigatinib and triple-mutant EGFR represents that the components B and E contributed less to the affinity than other compartments and were suitable for structural modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effectiveness of brigatinib in lung cancer cell lines</title><p>We then evaluated the effectiveness of brigatinib and other TKIs against triple-del19-positive lung cancer cell lines.

These results suggested that brigatinib took advantage of triple mutation regardless of cell type and will be a promising candidate to overcome the acquired resistance of third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs.

EGFR expression analysis by flow cytometry of the treated cells demonstrated a significant decrease over time in the cell surface EGFR level with brigatinib&#x0002b;cetuximab and a moderate decrease with cetuximab alone, but it demonstrated no reduction with brigatinib alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Western blot analysis of the corresponding treated cells showed that the decrease of total cellular EGFR achieved with cetuximab was potentiated when the cells were treated with brigatinib and cetuximab in combination and that the inhibition of phosphorylation of EGFR along with downstream signalling was also enhanced by this combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). In addition, the same experiments confirmed the suppression of total and cell surface EGFR expression using triple-del19-mutated EGFR-expressing MGH121-res2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). These results suggest that synergy of brigatinib and cetuximab was induced through the degeneration of EGFR on the surface caused by cetuximab resulting in intensification of the efficacy of brigatinib. We then performed <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments of PC9 triple-mutant xenograft cells as described above comparing with vehicle control, brigatinib alone, osimertinib alone, cetuximab alone, combination of osimertinib and cetuximab and combination of brigatinib and cetuximab. The combination of brigatinib and cetuximab demonstrated significant suppression of tumour growth without toxicity and achieved prolongation of survival periods compared with other treatment groups, especially osimertinib-treated group without any superiority to control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a&#x02013;c</xref>). We confirmed that its efficacy depended on the inhibition of phosphorylation of EGFR and the decreased expression of EGFR itself in western blotting of tumour samples obtained from each treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Panitumumab, another anti-EGFR antibody used for treating patients with colorectal cancer, showed a comparable synergistic effect as cetuximab in an <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e&#x02013;g</xref>).

Engineered Ba/F3 cells overexpressing triple-mutant EGFR were shown to be sensitive to brigatinib not only <italic>in vitro</italic> but also <italic>in vivo</italic>, as were the lung cancer cell lines with the triple-mutation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>). Brigatinib also demonstrated growth inhibition activity in PC9 triple-mutant xenograft model and in combination with anti-EGFR antibody to potentiate the efficacy both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> as shown in first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKI-resistant patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figs 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). Discovery of a promising drug that is effective against the triple mutation should be meaningful considering that the approval of osimertinib, the third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKI, in the United States and other countries may lead to a rapid increase in cases of acquired resistance due to the triple-mutant EGFR in the clinical setting.</p><p>As brigatinib is now under clinical development as an ALK&#x02013;TKI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, we also investigated the efficacy of similarly structured ALK&#x02013;TKIs against the triple-mutant EGFR. However, no other drugs exceeded brigatinib and its analog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 7&#x02013;9, 11</xref>). We had doubts about the disparity in their activity even if it is true that brigatinib was originally developed as a dual inhibitor of EGFR and ALK. The structure&#x02013;activity relationship and computer simulation suggested that the chloro, phosphine oxide group and methoxy group of brigatinib worked as key elements that contribute to its superior efficacy for triple-mutant EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;c</xref>). Also, these groups meaningfully gained the electrostatic or van der Waals intermolecular interaction energy in molecular simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>), supporting the speculation from the structure&#x02013;activity relationship. The binding pose of brigatinib also revealed that sufficient space appears to be available for substitutions on the piperidine ring and a phenyl ring connected to the phosphine oxide group, concomitantly with smaller contributions of the two substructures to the binding stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). These two functional groups (mentioned as parts B and E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>) may be suitable to be partially modified to achieve better binding affinity because of their lesser involvement in the predicted binding mode. These implications provide the opportunity to develop more potent new drugs by investigating derivatives of brigatinib in the future.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, brigatinib did not demonstrate satisfactory efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer; a recent phase 1/2 trial reported that only two of 42 cases achieved partial response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. However, the plasma concentrations of brigatinib at 180&#x02009;mg per day in a steady state reported previously (1,694.3&#x02009;nM (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and 1,447&#x02009;nM (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>)) were higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> values for triple-mutant EGFR presented in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1d,e</xref>). We expect that a combination of brigatinib and anti-EGFR antibody would improve sensitivity to the triple-mutant EGFR, resulting in better efficacy as shown in our study of the long-term tumour stability in PC9 triple-mutant xenografts and significant tumour shrinkage in MGH121-res2 xenografts; this implies that long-term &#x02018;stable disease' or &#x02018;partial response' was achieved with the combination therapy, whereas only the inhibition of tumour growth was attained with brigatinib monotherapy. Second, there is limited evidence that brigatinib directly affects the ATP-binding site of the triple-mutant EGFR because of the absence of a co-crystal structure, although our <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay results suggest that brigatinib inhibits triple-mutant EGFR in an ATP-competitive manner, and our computer simulation demonstrated its compatible interaction with the triple-mutant EGFR. Third, we have not yet experienced a sufficient number of cases of osimertinib resistance to estimate the true number of the triple-mutant EGFR. Up to the present, the prevalence of the triple mutation was estimated to be 2&#x02013;4&#x00025; among patients with lung cancer according to the frequency of 22&#x00025; among osimertinib-resistant cases reported in WCLC2015 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), and the C797S population would be equal to that of ALK-rearranged lung cancer patients with a similar clinical magnitude. In addition, in our N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea mutagenesis drug screen, all clones resistant to osimertinib mediated only the C797S mutation (unpublished data). Unless the triple-mutant EGFR occurs less frequently than is currently expected (&#x0223c;20&#x00025;), beating the triple-mutant EGFR is a worthy challenge as it is highly refractory to available drugs, although we can hope to overcome resistance due to other mechanisms such as T790M loss or bypass pathway activation using existing treatment modalities, for example, turning back to first-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs or combination therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, we found brigatinib to be potent against the triple-mutant EGFR in a focused drug-screening protocol and confirmed its activity in <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. The activity depended on ATP-competitive manner with less affection to wild-type EGFR. The combination therapy with anti-EGFR antibody showed more preferable activity than monotherapy <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> without toxicity. The structure&#x02013;activity relationship demonstrated that the efficacy of brigatinib exceeded that of its analogs, identifying several key basic structure and functional groups, such as the phosphine oxide group predicted from the computer simulation. The simulation indicated not only the conformation of brigatinib binding to the triple-mutant EGFR ATP-binding pocket in a compatible manner but also the potential for developing a more potent inhibitor by partial substitution in future direction. While the potency of brigatinib monotherapy does not seem to be completely satisfactory, the combination with anti-EGFR antibody strikingly reduced IC<sub>50</sub> against triple-mutant EGFR by inducing the degradation of surface and total EGFR expression, leading to tumour shrinkage of the triple-mutant EGFR-harbouring cells and significant prolongation of the survival of xenograft-bearing mice. Given that the development of brigatinib is now in the late phase of clinical trials and anti-EGFR antibodies are now broadly used clinically for several cancers other than lung cancer, the findings of this study should help to overcome the acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR&#x02013;TKIs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Kinase inhibitors and other drugs</title><p>The drugs used in the experiments and the companies from which they were purchased are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reagents and cell culture</title><p>MGH121 (EGFR-T790M/del19 derived from a lung cancer patient), MGH121-resistant-2 (EGFR-C797S/T790M/del19), PC9 parent (amplified EGFR-del19), PC9 T790M (amplified EGFR-T790M/del19) and PC9 triple-mutant (amplified EGFR-C797S/T790M/del19) cells were cultured in RPMI with 10&#x00025; serum.

Water molecules were placed around the complex model with an encompassing distance of 8&#x02009;&#x000c5; to form a 83 &#x000d7; 78 &#x000d7; 68&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>3</sup> periodic box, including roughly 13,000 water molecules. Charge-neutralizing ions were added to neutralize the system. All MD simulations were carried out using the GROMACS 4 programme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> on High-Performance Computing Infrastructure (HPCI). Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref> with a cutoff radius of 10&#x02009;&#x000c5;. Van der Waals interactions were cutoff at 10&#x02009;&#x000c5;. The P-LINCS algorithm was employed to constrain all bond lengths<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. After the fully solvated system was energy-minimized, the system was equilibrated for 100&#x02009;ps under constant volume and run for 100&#x02009;ps under constant pressure and temperature, with positional restraints on protein heavy atoms and compound atoms. Each production run was conducted for 50&#x02009;ns under constant pressure and temperature condition without the positional restraints. In this procedure, the temperature was maintained at 298&#x02009;K using velocity rescaling with a stochastic term<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> and the pressure was maintained at 1&#x02009;bar with the Parrinello&#x02013;Rahman pressure coupling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>, where the time constants for the temperature and pressure couplings to the bath were 0.3 and 1&#x02009;ps, respectively. Ten independent MD simulations were performed with the different initial structures, and thus we carried out MD simulations of 500&#x02009;ns in total. All MD runs were carried out with time steps of 2&#x02009;fs and snapshots were output every 2&#x02009;ps to yield 500 snapshots per nanosecond of simulation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data and statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software).
