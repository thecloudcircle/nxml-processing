While adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is the first-line treatment for IS, it is evident that the seizures associated with IS exhibit a clear circadian rhythm; however, the precise mechanisms underlying such seizures remain unclear. Melatonin is an important amine hormone and is regulated by circadian rhythm. Circadian proteins, especially Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Trasnslocator-like Protein (ARNTL or BMAL1) and Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK), and their target proteins Period Circadian Regulator 1 (PER1), Period Circadian Regulator 2 (PER2), Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), and Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), play key roles in circadian rhythm. This study explored the relationships between melatonin, genes associated with circadian rhythm, and epileptic spasm.</p><p><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Eighteen female rats were mated with nine male rats and 16 became pregnant. Twelve pregnant rats were subjected to prenatal stress by forced swimming in cold water from the day of conception. Rat pups produced by stressed mothers received an intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) on the 13th day after birth and were divided into four groups: NMDA (15 mg/kg), NMDA+ACTH (20 IU/kg), NMDA+melatonin (55 mg/kg), and NMDA+ACTH+melatonin (<italic>n</italic> = 36/group). Offspring from four dams that were not subjected to prenatal stress were used as controls. We then recorded latency and the frequency of flexion seizures. All offspring were sacrificed on the 14th day after birth and CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 expression was analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> NMDA induced spasm-like symptoms in rats. ACTH and melatonin significantly increased seizure latency and significantly reduced the frequency of seizures (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 expression was significantly lower in the NMDA group than the controls (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). ACTH significantly increased the expression of CLOCK, BAML1, PER1, and CRY1 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and melatonin significantly increased the expression of CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared with those of the NMDA group. There were no significant differences in the expression of BMAL1, CRY2, PER1, and PER2 when compared between the NMDA+ACTH+melatonin and control groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ACTH and melatonin significantly increased the expression of circadian genes and improved NMDA-induced seizures. The anticonvulsant effects of ACTH and melatonin are likely to involve regulation of the expression of these genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>infantile spasm</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>circadian gene</kwd><kwd>adrenocorticotropic hormone</kwd><kwd>melatonin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">81671279</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81771389</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100012166</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6136"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infantile spasm (IS) is a catastrophic and age-specific epilepsy syndrome characterized by epileptic spasm that occurs in infancy and can exert severe effects on growth and development. IS seizures are associated with circadian rhythm and mostly occur when infants experience arousal conditions and during the daytime, particularly during early drowsiness or after awakening; seizures are very rare during sleep (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The specific pathogenesis of IS has yet to be fully elucidated although previous studies have suggested that it may be associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), as an intermediate product of the HPA axis, and because of its ability to reduce levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) via negative feedback, is commonly used as a first-line treatment for IS; however, the precise mechanism involved remains unclear. The HPA axis is known to be closely related to the circadian rhythm. For example, a number of studies have demonstrated a circadian rhythm in the neuronal regulation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Based on such findings, it is possible that the pathogenesis of IS may be related to the excessive release of CRH in the hypothalamus. Previous research has demonstrated a close relationship between ACTH and circadian rhythm (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, whether ACTH can alter the expression levels of genes responsible for the circadian rhythm in IS, and whether its anticonvulsant effects are related to the regulation of circadian rhythm genes, remains unclear.</p><p>Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK), Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Trasnslocator-like Protein (ARNTL or BMAL1), Period Circadian Regulator 1 (PER1), Period Circadian Regulator 1 (PER2), Cryptochrome 1(CRY1), and Cryptochrome (CRY2) are considered to be the core proteins responsible for the circadian rhythm. These proteins interact with each other to influence the transcription of other circadian rhythm genes which mediate various physiological and pathological processes in the nervous system (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have shown that epilepsy is closely related to the circadian rhythm. For example, Quigg et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) reported obvious circadian rhythms in some types of epileptic seizures in both humans and experimental mice. In another study, Durazzo et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) retrospectively analyzed the electroencephalogram records of 131 adults with epilepsy and found that most epileptic seizures originating from the occipital and temporal lobes occurred in the afternoon, while seizures originating from the frontal and parietal lobes usually occurred at night. These findings indicated that the endogenous circadian rhythm differentially influences the manifestations of epilepsy in different regions of the brain (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, whether the pathogenesis of IS is related to abnormalities in factors associated with the circadian rhythm has yet to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Melatonin is an amine hormone synthesized and secreted by the pineal gland, which is regulated by the circadian rhythm and can also exert effects upon the circadian rhythm. The secreted levels of melatonin during the night can be 5&#x02013;10 times higher than that during the daytime; consequently, melatonin can be used as a drug for sleep disorders to regulate circadian rhythms in patients with insomnia (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Previous studies have shown that epilepsy is associated with melatonin levels. For example, the administration of exogenous melatonin can reduce the number of seizures, prolong the latency to seizure and reduce the severity of epilepsy (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In a previous study, Mosi&#x00144;ska et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) suggested that melatonin may control the frequency and threshold of epileptic seizures by regulating the expression of circadian rhythm genes. However, the precise mechanism underlying this protective effect, and whether melatonin can restore the expression of circadian rhythm genes in IS, has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>There are mainly three ways to induce the acute animal model of infantile spasm, such as NMDA rat model, prenatal betamethasone/stress+post-natal NMDA rat model and GBL/Down syndrome mouse model. We choose the prenatal stress+post-natal NMDA rat model for its characteristics with age dependency, spasm-like seizures, cognitive impairment and response to ACTH, which fulfills the criteria of an infantile spasm model (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to observe the role of the circadian rhythm in the pathogenesis of epileptic spasm and to investigate whether the anticonvulsant effects of ACTH and melatonin are related to the regulation of circadian rhythm factors in an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced infant rat model of acute spasm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and Prenatal Treatment</title><p>Nine 3-month-old male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats, and 18 female SD rats, weighing 270&#x02013;350 g, were selected from the Laboratory Animal Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital and placed in a standard polycarbonate cage (35 &#x000d7; 30 &#x000d7; 17 cm) at a temperature of 20&#x000b0;C, a relative humidity of 50&#x02013;60% and with a controlled photoperiod (12 h light:12 h dark; lights on and off at 8 am and 8 pm, respectively). Food and drinking water were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> and the rats were allowed to acclimatize for 1 week prior to experimentation.</p><p>Female rats were then mated with male rats. The presence of a vaginal plug was considered as gestational day 1; in total, 16 female rats became pregnant. From gestational day 1, 12 pregnant dams were subjected to stress. To induce stress, the pregnant rats were placed into a transparent plexiglass bucket (50 cm in height &#x000d7; 20 cm in diameter) filled with cold water (4&#x000b0;C) at 5 pm each day and forced to swim for 5 min. Thereafter, the rats were removed from the bucket and dried in a heated container for 10 min before being returned to the cage. Stress was administered daily until parturition. The other four dams were not exposed to stress. We ensured that we used the minimum number of animals necessary and took great care to reduce any unnecessary discomfort. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, China (Reference number: 20160134).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Groups</title><p>Offspring without prenatal stress were used as a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 36).

On P13, all offspring exposed to prenatal stress (<italic>n</italic> = 144) were injected (i.p.) with NMDA (15 mg/kg) to induce epileptic seizures. We then recorded the latency from injection to flexion seizure and the number of flexion seizures. The severity of seizures was evaluated according to an established system: grade 0 (no seizures, normally active); grade 1 (stable and puffing); grade 2 (hyperactive, irritated, twisting tail continuously); grade 3 (bothering itself and others); grade 4 (repeated flexion, <italic>n</italic> &#x02264; 4); grade 5 (repeated flexion, 5 &#x02264; <italic>n</italic> &#x02264; 14); grade 6 (repeated flexion, 15 &#x02264; <italic>n</italic> &#x02264; 29); grade 7 (repeated flexion, <italic>n</italic> &#x02265; 30); grade 8 (extremities showing thrashing-like movements after tonic&#x02013;clonic seizures); and grade 9 (death).

Furthermore, NMDA-induced seizures were associated with significant reductions in the expression levels of several key circadian rhythm proteins (CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2). However, the administration of ACTH significantly increased the expression of PER1, CRY1, and CLOCK proteins, while the administration of melatonin significantly increased the expression of all circadian rhythm proteins (CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2). Some of these increases (BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2) were larger in the group of rats receiving a combination of ACTH and melatonin treatments. Finally, we showed that the expression of key circadian rhythm proteins was positively correlated with the latency to flexion seizure and negatively correlated with the frequency of flexion seizures. Collectively, these data demonstrate that these circadian rhythm proteins may play an important role in the pathogenesis of epileptic spasm and demonstrate the anticonvulsant effects of ACTH and melatonin.</p><p>In a previous study, Nakken et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) reported that abnormalities of the endogenous circadian rhythm observed in sleep disorders could induce various types of epilepsy, particularly idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Subsequent studies confirmed that the core circadian rhythm genes, <italic>BMAL1</italic> and <italic>CLOCK</italic>, affected both seizure threshold and excitability (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Furthermore, Wallace et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) reported that BMAL1 and CLOCK, and their respective target genes <italic>PER1</italic> and <italic>PER2</italic>, showed lower levels of expression in the hypothalamus of mice following knockout of the voltage-dependent potassium channel gene KCNA1. In the present study, we found that NMDA-induced seizures were associated with reduced expression of several circadian rhythm proteins (CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2). Collectively, these findings indicate that circadian rhythm factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, including specific forms of epilepsy, such as IS. ACTH, an intermediate product of the HPA axis, is commonly used as the first-line treatment for IS. Previous research has shown that ACTH may regulate the release and expression of neurotransmitters by inhibiting the release of CRH by negative feedback, thus controlling spastic seizures; however, the specific mechanism involved has yet to be elucidated (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In this study, we found that ACTH treatment reduced the frequency of flexion seizures and increased the expression of PER1, CRY1, and CLOCK proteins.</p><p>While numerous researchers have investigated the effect of ACTH on IS, no studies have investigated the effect of melatonin on IS. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, which is regulated by the circadian rhythm and can also influence the circadian rhythm in turn. Exogenous administration of melatonin is also known to enhance the expression of genes associated with the circadian rhythm (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Previous studies have also shown that melatonin is associated with epilepsy and that the administration of melatonin can effectively control seizures, increase the threshold of epileptic seizure, and prolong the seizure latency and reduce the severity of epilepsy (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This study showed that melatonin can reduce the frequency of flexion seizures and increase the expression of CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 proteins. The combined effect of ACTH and melatonin on the expression of genes associated with the circadian rhythm was more extensive than the effect of either ACTH or melatonin alone, suggesting that circadian rhythm factors may play a key role in the mechanisms underlying the combined anticonvulsant effect of ACTH and melatonin.</p><p>It is generally accepted that the circadian rhythm is associated with epilepsy via two principal mechanisms. First, circadian rhythm genes (<italic>BMAL1</italic> and <italic>CLOCK</italic>), and their transcription factor complex, BMAL1&#x02013;CLOCK, are known to influence the expression of other genes that are causally involved in epilepsy (for example, <italic>PAR DBP, TEF</italic>, and <italic>HLF</italic>) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). One previous study reported that the knockout of CLOCK in the excitatory pyramidal neurons of rats resulted in a reduced seizure threshold and an increased number of seizures during sleep. This was combined with reduced dendritic spine formation and alterations in the electrophysiological characteristics of the neuronal microcircuits containing excitatory pyramidal cells. These changes resulted in a paroxysmal depolarizing shift, the cellular hallmark of epilepsy (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The same phenomenon was observed in <italic>BMAL1</italic> knockout mice (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The second mechanism is related to the mTOR pathway, which is also known to be regulated by circadian rhythm factors (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Mutations in the mTOR inhibitor genes, <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic>, have been shown to cause overactivity in the mTOR pathway, thus leading to epilepsy in patients with tuberous sclerosis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Evidence also suggests that mutations in other regulatory proteins, such as the GATOR1 complex, can lead to disinhibition of the mTOR pathway, thus resulting in nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Based on these two theories, previous studies have suggested that key molecules in the mTOR pathway (such as the translation initiation factor 4EBP1 and the kinase S6K1) can change the period and amplitude of CLOCK expression by regulating protein synthesis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and that BMAL1 is regulated by the phosphorylation of S6K1 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, circadian rhythm genes maybe involved in the pathogenesis of spasms through the above approaches.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study that need to be considered. Firstly, our sample size was small. Secondly, due to funding limitations, we only used an animal model and did not perform clinical studies. Thirdly, this is a acute spasms model, although we speculate that it may have chronic effects, but unable to reflect the actual clinical situation. Finally, we were unable to knock out appropriate genes in order to confirm the mechanisms that may be associated with our observations. Futher experiments and clinical studies are needed to validate the findings of the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study showed that NMDA-induced seizures were associated with the reduced expression of circadian rhythm proteins and that the administration of ACTH and/or melatonin increased the latency to seizure and reduced the frequency of flexion seizures. The anticonvulsant effects of ACTH and melatonin are likely to be related to regulatory effects on the expression of genes associated with the circadian rhythm. These results pave the way toward a better understanding of factors associated with the circadian rhythm and their involvement in epilepsy. The findings also enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anticonvulsant properties of ACTH and melatonin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by Ethics Committee of the First Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, China.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LW, X-YS, L-PZ, and GY contributed to the conception and design of the study.
