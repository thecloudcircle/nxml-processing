This could easily progress to chronic and refractory pain, which presents a great challenge in terms of management. Conventional pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain include antidepressants and antiepileptics;<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> however, the number of patients who achieve satisfactory pain relief is low, and is only 10% to 25% more than patients receiving placebo.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Moreover, high comorbidity rates accompanied by chronic neuropathic pain, such as insomnia, anxiety, or depression,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> further makes the treatment challenging, and patients seek alternative treatment strategies including acupuncture treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Some studies have proposed the mechanisms of acupuncture for pain reduction. The local analgesic effects of acupuncture are mediated by adenosine A1 receptors<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> or inactivation of the myofascial trigger point.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Acupuncture analgesia can also be induced segmentally by the gate-control theory of pain. Needling of some acupuncture points located at the extremities can generally reduce pain through descending inhibitory pain control by serotonin and noradrenaline.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Recently, clinical evidence on acupuncture for chronic pain, which is similar to nociceptive pain, has been well-established through many systematic reviews<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> and clinical guidelines.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> A meta-analysis assessing 20,827 individual patient data from 39 trials suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment option for chronic pain, including nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, headache, or shoulder pain, and that its effects persist over time, with only a small decrease at 1 year.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> The guidelines published by the American College of Physicians recommend that acupuncture should initially be selected for patients with chronic low back pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> However, when focusing on neuropathic pain such as diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, or failed back surgery syndrome, there is no sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>Our pilot study<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> explored effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) for patients with moderate to severe neuropathic pain despite already receiving conventional oral medications, and assessed the feasibility of a large-scale trial. The results showed that EA significantly decreased the intensity of pain in neuropathic patients, especially burning sensations, electric shock-like pain, and mechanical hyperalgesia. Furthermore, the number of acupuncture sessions was a significant factor for favorable results of reducing pain intensity. Based on our previous trial, we designed a large-scale, prospective, open-labeled, randomized, cross-over clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 12 sessions of EA for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods and design</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of EA treatment for neuropathic pain when added to conventional neuropathic pain pharmacotherapies compared with no EA treatment.

The expected recruitment period is from December 2019 to May 2021. Participants will be recruited through advertising on the bulletin boards of the hospital, internet homepages of the hospital, public institutions, and through the media.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2.2</label><title>Study plan</title><p>This study is a cross-over trial that aims to compare conventional medical treatment (treatment C) with conventional medical treatment and an add-on EA treatment (treatment A) for patients with intractable neuropathic pain. A cross-over design was planned in which participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups (AC and CA groups) according to the 2 treatment sequences.</p><p>Screening will be conducted after receiving written informed consent from the participant at SNUH Pain Center (Visit 1). They will then be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 sequence groups: the AC group and CA group (Visit 2). The first treatment period will be conducted for 6 weeks. In the case of &#x0201c;treatment A&#x0201d;, during the treatment period, a total of 12 EA sessions will be performed for 6 weeks at KHUKMH. After the first treatment period, evaluations will continue at SNUH Pain Center (Visit 3). After a washout period of 2 weeks, participants will undergo a pain evaluation period for 7 days (Visit 4). If the average numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, which is self-recorded in a diary, is 4 points or more during this period, patients will proceed to the second treatment period. If it is less than 4 points, the same &#x0201c;treatment C&#x0201d; will be maintained. The second treatment period will also be conducted for 6 weeks, as in the first treatment period, followed by a final evaluation (Visit 5).

EA treatment will be performed by Korean medicine doctors who graduated after 6 years of Korean medical college education and have at least 8 years of clinical experience. A total of 12 acupuncture sessions for 6 weeks will be performed using 0.25&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;40&#x0200a;mm disposable sterile acupuncture needles (Dongbang Acupuncture Inc., Chungnam, South Korea), which will be retained for 15 minutes. Up to 20 acupuncture points will be chosen by the practitioner based on traditional Asian medicine and western medical perspectives<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> for local, segmental, and general stimulation. Local stimulation is defined insertion of the needle at a classical acupuncture point, tender point, or trigger point near the painful area. Segmental stimulation is insertion of the needle around area innervated by the same meridian or spinal nerve as that of the painful region. If direct needling to the local and segmental points exacerbates the pain, perisegmental points that are close to the affected segment, such as those above and below the area, or those on the opposite side of the equivalent contralateral segment will be used. Distal points which are located in the extremities for general stimulation will be chosen to treat the comorbidities of chronic pain according to traditional theory, such as insomnia (PC6, HT7, BL62, or KI6), depression/anxiety (PC6, HT7, LI4, or SP6), or fatigue (ST36, SP6, LU8, or GB20).</p><p>Electrical stimulation will be delivered using an EA device (ES-160, Ito Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) with 2&#x0200a;Hz (local points), 2 to 6&#x0200a;Hz (local points or distal points), 120&#x0200a;Hz (segmental points), or 2 to 120&#x0200a;Hz (distal points) (altering every 2&#x0200a;seconds, 0.5 to 10&#x0200a;mA) approximately 80% of the maximum intensity.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Permitted and prohibited concomitant treatments</title><p>Existing oral and transdermal drugs (opioids, tramadol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid, muscle relaxants, topical capsaicin, neurotropin, prostaglandin, local anesthetics, vitamin B1 and B12, and nefopam) should be taken at the existing dose from screening to the end of the study. Depending on the pain intensity, additional prescription of oral acetaminophen is allowed as a rescue medicine for analgesic purposes. If acetaminophen is used, the participant should record the dose of acetaminophen and date in the patient diary. Anticonvulsants and antidepressants, which were being used to control symptoms of existing neuropathic pain, are also taken at the maintenance dose during the study period. Only when there are safety problems with the use of these drugs, dose reduction or discontinuation of these drugs will be permitted if necessary.</p><p>Subjects who received interventional therapies such as nerve block, iontophoresis, laser therapy, spinal cord irritation, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation have a minimum washout period of 7 days prior to their first visit. These therapies are prohibited in the study period. Other forms of pain relief therapy for neuralgia such as psychotherapy and physiotherapy can be continued from 14 days prior to the first visit if the frequency of therapy does not change; however, these are not allowed to start during the study period.</p></sec><sec><label>2.7</label><title>Outcomes</title><sec><label>2.7.1</label><title>Primary outcome measurement</title><p>The proportion of participants who achieved improvement, as measured by the predefined composite efficacy outcome (CEO) [NRS decreased from baseline + pain interference scale (PIS) in the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) decreased by more than 20% from baseline + &#x0201c;minimally improved&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;much improved&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;very much improved&#x0201d; in patient global impression change (PGIC)] at 6 weeks after randomization, will be used as the primary outcome measurement.</p></sec><sec><label>2.7.2</label><title>Secondary outcome measurements</title><p>Secondary outcomes include the differences in NRS score, the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire, the BPI-SF, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, PGIC, EQ-5D-3L, PD-Q, Patient Satisfaction Scale, and incremental cost-effective ratio at 6 and 15 weeks after randomization will be measured.</p></sec><sec><label>2.7.3</label><title>Safety outcome measurements</title><p>Safety will be examined on every visit by measuring vital signs, performing physical examinations, and recording adverse events (AEs).

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EA combined with conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone after 6 weeks of treatment.</p><p>This confirmatory trial was designed after adapting the results of our previous pilot trial<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> which showed that the protocol was feasible and acceptable for a large scale trial considering the low dropout and high compliance rate. The study identified the appropriate dose of EA treatment, which was 12 sessions, once or twice a week, for 8 weeks. EA twice a week during the first 4 weeks led to an almost 50% reduction in pain intensity from baseline; however, EA once a week for the following 4 weeks did not have a clinically meaningful analgesic effect. Therefore, we will administer a total of 12 sessions of EA treatment twice a week for 6 weeks.</p><p>In our pilot study,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> affective dimensions, overall quality of life, and pain intensity were also improved after EA treatment. Since accompanying symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, and depression, which are major comorbidities of chronic pain can affect pain intensity,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> it is necessary to identify the degree to which the analgesic effect of EA treatment correlates with the effect of these symptoms. Therefore, we measured the effect of EA treatment on these comorbidities with validated scales.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that pain intensity alone could not assess the value of interventions and overall experience of patients with chronic pain, and the functional aspect and quality of life should also be comprehensively considered.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Therefore, integrating the assessment of pain intensity and functional disability is recommended for a trial assessing chronic pain, although there are some methodological disadvantages.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Based on the results of our previous study, we defined the CEO to include pain intensity, various aspects of pain, and global assessment of the patient, and adapted it for this confirmatory trial.</p><p>To summarize, using data from our pilot study, this confirmatory trial was adapted with several improvements, and will assess the effectiveness and safety of EA in patients with refractory neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank all members of the research team (doctors and clinical research coordinators) at KHUKMH and SNUH pain center.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Seunghoon Lee, Jee Youn Moon.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Seunghoon Lee, Jee Youn Moon.</p><p><bold>Methodology and project administration:</bold> Seunghoon Lee, Jee Youn Moon, Sang Hoon Lee.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Seunghoon Lee, Suji Lee.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Jee Youn Moon, Chang-Soon Lee, Yongjae Yoo, Sang Hoon Lee.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AEs = Adverse Events, BPI-SF = Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, CEO = Composite Efficacy Outcome, EA = electroacupuncture, IRB = Institutional Review Board, KHUKMH = Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, MRCC = Medical Research Collaborating Center, NRS = Numeric Rating Scale, PD-Q = PainDETECT Questionnaire, PGIC = Patient Global Impression Change, SD = standard deviation, SNUH = Seoul National University Hospital.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>How to cite this article: Moon JY, Lee CS, Yoo Y, Lee S, Lee SH, Lee S.
