As a result, the use of adjuvants to enhance and direct adaptive immune responses has become the focus of much targeted bovine vaccine research. However, the mechanisms by which adjuvants work to enhance immunological protection in many cases remains unclear, although this knowledge is critical to the rational design of effective next generation vaccines. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which alum, a commonly used adjuvant in bovine vaccines, enhances IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Unlike the case with human PBMCs, alum promoted IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in a subset of bovine PBMCs without priming with a toll-like receptor agonist. This suggests that PBMCs from some cattle are primed to produce this potent inflammatory cytokine and western blotting confirmed the presence of preexisting pro-IL-1&#x003b2; in PBMCs from a subset of 8-month-old cattle. To address the mechanism underlying alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, specific inhibitors identified that alum mediates lysosomal disruption which subsequently activates the assembly of an NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and potentially caspase-8 containing complex. These components form an inflammasome, which mediates alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in bovine PBMCs. Given the demonstrated role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in regulating adaptive immunity in murine systems, these results will inform further targeted research into the potential of inflammasome activation for rational vaccine design in cattle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adjuvant</kwd><kwd>alum</kwd><kwd>bovine</kwd><kwd>IL-1</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>peripheral blood mononuclear cells</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Teagasc<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001604</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Science Foundation Ireland<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001602</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">12/1A/1421</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6179"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>IL-1&#x003b2;, a member of the IL-1 cytokine family, is an inflammatory cytokine that mediates an array of effector functions including vasodilation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and adhesion molecule expression (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Primarily produced by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, IL-1&#x003b2; synthesis and secretion is tightly regulated. It requires a signal (&#x0201c;signal 1&#x0201d;), generally in the form of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) or endogenous danger signal to induce the expression of pro-IL-1&#x003b2;, followed by &#x0201c;signal 2&#x0201d; to activate caspase-1, which processes the cytokine into its active form (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The NLRP3 inflammasome, comprising NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, is the best characterized inflammasome and can be activated by a range of stimuli including uric acid, cholesterol crystals, ATP, silica, and asbestos (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Additionally, in murine and human cells it has been shown that alum based adjuvants can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, resulting in the secretion of bioactive IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Presently, alum is one of a select few adjuvants approved for use in human and veterinary vaccines. Despite its widespread use, the immuno-modulatory properties of alum are not fully understood and have received little attention in a bovine context. Upon injection, alum recruits an array of innate cells including monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and neutrophils (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Additionally, alum injection triggers the production of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-18, and keratinocyte chemoattractant (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In mice, it has been established that alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion is reduced in NLRP3 and caspase-1-deficient cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Alum is an effective adjuvant at promoting antigen specific humoral immunity but has limited capacity to promote Th1 responses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As result, alum is not an optimal adjuvant for all vaccines. However, many of these findings are based on murine studies so understanding the mechanism by which alum enhances immune responses in a bovine context is important to advance bovine vaccine development.</p><p>Interindividual variation in responses to both antigens and adjuvants may contribute to suboptimal efficacy of a number of bovine vaccines. These systems may be developed in mouse models and are limited by the lack of a sufficiently detailed understanding of the bovine immune response and therefore often do not work well in cattle (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Given the significant differences in innate immunity between species and the widespread use of alum as an adjuvant in cattle, it is therefore important to address the specific effects of alum in bovine cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal procedures were carried out according to the provisions of the EU Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes Regulations 2012 (SI No. 543 of 2012) as amended and Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament issued from the Health Products Regulatory Authority Ireland&#x02014;license number AE 19132/P030.

Typically, toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists prime cells to synthesize inactive pro-IL-1&#x003b2; while activation of the inflammasome triggers caspase-1 activation and the cleavage and secretion of processed IL-1&#x003b2;.

This probe is comprised of an affinity peptide sequence specific for caspase-1 (YVAD), a far-red fluorescent 660 dye and a fluoromethyl ketone reactive moiety. This reagent enters cells and irreversibly binds to active caspase-1 thereby emitting and retaining the red signal inside cells positive for caspase-1. The results were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. The results demonstrate that the percentage of cells positive for caspase-1 activity is increased in response to alum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion is caspase-1 dependent.

Additionally, lysosomal damage and release of hydrolases has been shown to up-regulate caspase-1 activity (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To determine whether lysosomal proteases play a role in regulating bovine IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, PBMCs were cultured for 1&#x02009;h with an inhibitor (CA-074-Me) targeting cathepsin B, a protease released during lysosomal damage.

Cells stimulated with LPS and alum produced substantially less IL-1&#x003b2; when incubated in the presence of the cathepsin B inhibitor than those cultured without the inhibitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). Since at high concentrations this inhibitor can also inhibit other lysosomal cysteine cathepsins (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), we confirmed these results with CA-074 which although less cell permeable than CA-074-Me, has been shown to have enhanced selectivity for cathepsin B (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B).

Although inflammasome activation has been implicated as an important component of the bovine immune response to pathogens, including mycobacteria (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), the detailed mechanisms of inflammasome activation in a bovine context have not been addressed.</p><p>Given the distinct evolutionary differences between species, mechanistic understanding from human and murine studies cannot be assumed to apply in other species, including cattle. For example, in contrast to humans and mice, genes that encode DNA sensing inflammasome-associated proteins like the Pyrin and Hin domain family are Pseudogenised in some mammals including cattle (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This suggests that these mammals have evolved alternate mechanisms to cope with DNA viruses.

Surprisingly, in the absence of LPS, alum was sufficient for promoting IL-1&#x003b2; secretion from PBMCs in a subset of animals, a result in contrast to what is observed in murine and human macrophages (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These results show for the first time that IL-1&#x003b2; activation in PBMCs from a subset of animals is not solely dependent on LPS stimulation and that a subset of Friesian cattle have primed cells capable of secreting IL-1&#x003b2; in response to alum alone. Moreover, this was not seen in human PBMCs suggesting a bovine-specific response.</p><p>The intracellular processes underlying alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion were investigated, using inflammasome-specific inhibitors in cell culture. In mice, loss of NLRP3 and caspase-1 abrogates alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion <italic>in vitro</italic>, while a role for caspase-8 has also been proposed (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Consistent with what has been recorded in mice, alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in bovine PBMCs is NLRP3 and caspase-1 dependent. Furthermore, results obtained using the FLICA assay confirm that alum can promote the activation of caspase-1 in bovine PBMCs. Unexpectedly, results from the FLICA assay showed that unstimulated PBMCs expressed active caspase-1. However, published data from Netea et al showed that caspase-1 was active in untreated human monocytes but not in macrophages (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Alum-induced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion was reduced when caspase-8 was inhibited, thus suggesting that both caspase-1 and caspase-8 play roles in this process.

Several studies have demonstrated that the oligomerization of ASC is key to NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), but this had not previously been addressed in bovine cells.

In the current study, the size of the alum-induced ASC oligomers corresponds to what was recorded in humans. Similarly, in accordance with murine studies, these data also demonstrate that alum leads to lysosomal degradation and subsequent cathepsin release, which ultimately leads to the activation of the inflammasome in bovine PBMCs. It has been reported that cathepsin B mediates the activation of NLRP3 and caspase-1 leading to the secretion of processed IL-1&#x003b2; in mice (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>To ensure the effectiveness of novel vaccine formulations, antigenicity has to be combined with adjuvanticity. Recent moves toward subunit vaccines yields higher specificity but with a requirement for effective adjuvants to activate and direct innate immunity and enhance immunogenicity (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Although the role of alum in activating the inflammasome in mice has been well documented, its mechanism of action in cattle PBMCs was previously unclear. Given that alum has been incorporated into numerous bovine vaccine formulations, such as those against Leptospirosis, BVDV and Blue tongue virus, investigation of its mode of action in bovine PBMCs is important to facilitate more rational vaccine design. It will be important in future to address the role of the inflammasome in vaccine efficacy in a bovine context <italic>in vivo</italic> as there are conflicting reports from murine studies regarding the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in driving adaptive immunity, particularly antibody responses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The current data will inform future studies and aid the design of novel bovine vaccines aimed at targeting the inflammasome. As well as playing key roles in antigen presenting cells, inflammasome activation in epithelial cells could also be of significant importance in response to bovine mucosal vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal procedures were carried out according to the provisions under the EU Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes Regulations 2012 (SI No. 543 of 2012) as amended and Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament issued from the Health Products Regulatory Authority Ireland&#x02014;license number (AE 19132/P030).
