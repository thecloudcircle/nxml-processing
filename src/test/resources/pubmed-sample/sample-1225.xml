For successful lung cancer treatment, there is a strong need of newer therapeutics with metastasis-inhibitory potential. In the present study, we determined the anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic potential of a natural plant triterpenoid, Cucurbitacin B (CuB) against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. CuB demonstrated a strong anti-migratory and anti-invasive ability against metastatic NSCLC at nanomolar concentrations. CuB also showed significant tumor angiogenesis-inhibitory effects as evidenced by the inhibition of migratory, invasive and tube-forming capacities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. CuB-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis was validated by the inhibition of pre-existing vasculature in chick embryo chorio-allantoic membrane and matrigel plugs. Similarly, CuB inhibited the migratory behavior of TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced experimental EMT model. The CuB-mediated inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis was attributable to the downregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling axis, validated by siRNA-knockdown of <italic>Wnt3</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic>. The CuB-mediated downregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling was also validated using 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung tumorigenesis model <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, our findings suggest that CuB inhibited the metastatic abilities of NSCLC through the inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling axis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Metastasis contributes to the malignant progression of cancer, thereby adding to the fatality of the disease. The delayed diagnosis of lung cancers facilitates metastasis of primary lung tumors to secondary metastatic sites such as bones and brain. Tumor angiogenesis also plays a very important role in the progression as well as metastatic spread of solid tumors including lung tumors. Therefore, for effective lung cancer treatment, efficient anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic agents are required. Natural compounds have been shown to have enormous potential as anti-proliferative as well as anti-metastatic agents against multiple cancer types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

Recent reports have also shown that CuB effectively inhibits migratory and invasive potential of breast cancer and liver cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, the effect of CuB on lung cancer metastasis as well as tumor angiogenesis has yet not been explored.</p><p>Canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway is well known to be functionally important in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, motility as well as polarity. Aberrations in this pathway are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple tumor types, including lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Aberrant promoter methylation has been linked to the upregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Wnt binding to the frizzled (FZD) receptors guides nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin, further leading to the activation of genes involved in the cellular proliferation, metastasis as well as angiogenesis. Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, together with the Notch and Hedgehog pathways, has been shown to be involved in self-renewal of hematopoietic as well as cancer stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to determine the anti-migratory and anti-invasive potential of CuB on metastatic human NSCLC cells and in the 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung tumorigenesis mice model. We also assessed the effect of CuB treatment on the angiogenic potential of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) <italic>in vitro</italic>. For the assessment of anti-angiogenic properties of CuB <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo,</italic> we utilized chick embryo chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) and matrigel plug assays, respectively. CuB inhibited the &#x003b2;-catenin expression as well as nuclear localization in the NSCLC cells as well as NNK-induced lung tissues. CuB-mediated downregulation of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling led to the downregulation of in the protein expression of &#x003b2;-catenin target genes. Role of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in CuB-mediated anti-metastatic effects was validated by siRNA knockdown of <italic>Wnt3/3A</italic>. Our findings suggest that CuB inhibits migratory and invasive abilities of both moderately as well as highly metastatic NSCLC cells through the downregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling axis. In addition, CuB exhibits potent anti-angiogenic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>ex vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>CuB inhibits the migratory potential of human NSCLC cells</title><p>To assess the effects of CuB treatment on the migratory potential of different human NSCLC cells, we performed wound healing assays in moderately metastatic A549 as well as highly metastatic H1299 and H23 lung cancer cells with different concentrations of CuB. We found that CuB induced a significant dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cellular migration in A549 cells, starting with the concentrations of 25&#x02009;nM at 12 and 24&#x02009;h, and 10&#x02009;nM at 48&#x02009;h, respectively. Similarly for highly metastatic H1299 and H23 cells, the significant dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cellular migration was observed starting with concentrations as low as 10&#x02009;nM and 25&#x02009;nM, respectively (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). These concentrations of CuB were much lesser than the IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations for cellular proliferation and apoptosis against NSCLC, as reported by us, previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Therefore, these results indicate that CuB inhibits the migratory capability of NSCLC cells at sub-toxic concentrations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CuB inhibits the invasive capability and stemness of human NSCLC cells</title><p>We next analyzed the effects of CuB on the invading ability of the NSCLC cells. Moderately invasive A549 as well as highly invasive H1299 and H23 cells were treated with varying concentrations of CuB for 48&#x02009;h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, CuB exhibits significant dose-dependent inhibition of invasion in A549 at 50&#x02009;nM and 100&#x02009;nM concentrations (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 and p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, respectively). In case of H1299 cells, invasion was significantly inhibited at CuB concentrations &#x02265;25&#x02009;nM (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Similarly, in H23 cells, significant dose-dependent inhibition of invasion was observed at concentrations starting with 25&#x02009;nM of CuB. We performed tumorsphere assays in A549 and H1299 cells in serum-free, non-adherent conditions to assess the effects of CuB on the stemness of these cells. CuB significantly reduced the size and frequency of tumorspheres in both A549 and H1299 cells, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The effect of CuB on the <italic>in vitro</italic> colony forming potential of NSCLC cells was determined using anchorage-dependent colony formation assay. CuB significantly inhibited the colony formation in A549 and H1299 cells starting with a concentration of 0.5&#x02009;nM, and at &#x02265;5&#x02009;nM CuB concentrations, no colonies were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that CuB dose-dependently inhibits the invasive ability as well as stemness of NSCLC cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CuB inhibits endothelial cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis</title><p>Endothelial cell migration is an essential step in tumor angiogenesis. To determine the effect of CuB on the endothelial cell migration, we preformed wound healing assay in HUVECs treated with varying concentrations of CuB. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>, CuB at concentrations &#x02265;10&#x02009;nM significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HUVECs at 24&#x02009;h. Tubulogenesis is the exclusive ability of endothelial cells to form tube-like structures, which facilitate the formation of new blood vessels. We assessed the effect of CuB on the tube-formation ability of HUVECs; CuB dose-dependently inhibited the tube formation in HUVECs after 6&#x02013;8&#x02009;h, at concentrations &#x02265;10&#x02009;nM (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We also assessed the effect of CuB on <italic>ex vivo</italic> angiogenesis through CAM assay. CuB was shown to considerably inhibit the pre-existing vasculature after 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We analyzed the effects of CuB on the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in matrigel plugs <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that 100&#x02009;ng/mL VEGF induced the formation of blood vessels in the matrigel plugs. The intraperitonial administration of 0.1 and 0.2&#x02009;mg/Kg b.w. CuB resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in the VEGF-induced matrigel plugs. The standard angiogenesis inhibitor, imatinib also considerably inhibited the microvessel formation in these VEGF-induced matrigel plugs. Further, histological analysis of matrigel plugs confirmed the inhibition of functional vasculature followed by the CuB as well as imatinib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that in addition to its anti-migratory and anti-invasive capabilities, CuB also exhibits strong anti-angiogenic potential, which might contribute to the anti-cancer properties of CuB in NSCLC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CuB inhibits &#x003b2;-catenin expression as well as nuclear localization in human NSCLC cells</title><p>Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is essential for the lung tumorigenesis as well as maintenance of the stemness-characteristics in multiple cancer subtypes including lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To ascertain the role of &#x003b2;-catenin behind the anti-metastatic and anti-stemness activity of CuB, we examined &#x003b2;-catenin expression as well as nuclear translocation through confocal immunofluorescence imaging in NSCLC cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,C</xref>, untreated A549 cells showed a higher &#x003b2;-catenin expression with lower nuclear localization. We observed a significant dose-dependent decrease in the cellular expression of &#x003b2;-catenin in A549 cells followed by CuB treatment. Moreover, the remaining &#x003b2;-catenin was found to be accumulated towards the cytoplasmic membrane. In case of H1299 cells, the untreated control cells displayed intense &#x003b2;-catenin localization both in the cytoplasm and nucleus compared to untreated A549 cells, which deciphers the role of &#x003b2;-catenin in the metastatic ability of these NSCLC cells. CuB treatment induced significant downregulation of the cytoplasmic expression and nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in a dose-dependent manner (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B,D</xref>). Similarly, we also found a significant dose-dependent decrease in the expression as well as nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in H23 cells followed by CuB treatment (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2A,C</xref>). These results suggest that downregulation of &#x003b2;-catenin expression as well nuclear localization are associated with the anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic functions of CuB.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CuB inhibits canonical &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in human NSCLC cells</title><p>The nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin results in the activation of canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, leading to the transcriptional activation of downstream targets. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of CuB on the expression patterns of proteins involved in this pathway and the downstream targets of &#x003b2;-catenin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A&#x02013;D</xref>, the expression of both Wnt3 and Wnt3a was found to be significantly inhibited by the CuB treatment, in both A549 and H1299 cells. Surprisingly, the expression of seven-pass transmembrane FZD-7 receptor was found to be significantly increased by the CuB treatment in both the cell lines. GSK-3, a key component of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, is an important member of &#x003b2;-catenin degradation complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In mammalian cells, GSK-3 protein exists as two homologs, GSK-3&#x003b1; and GSK-3&#x003b2;. It has been established that both of these GSK-3 homologs function identically in the regulation of Wnt signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b1; at serine 21 and phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; at serine 9 leads to inhibition of these proteins, leading to the activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We found loss of inhibitory phosphorylations at both GSK-3&#x003b1; and GSK-3&#x003b2; as well as upregulation of GSK-3&#x003b1; and GSK-3&#x003b2; expression in both A549 and H1299 cells. These events cumulatively result in an increased active GSK-3 activity, which culminates into &#x003b2;-catenin degradation. The expression of transcription factor TCF-1 was found to be downregulated in both A549 and H1299 cells. Matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) are enzymes, which facilitate the cancer cell invasion and migration through the degradation of the extracellular matrix. MMP-2 is one such gelatinase, which is also directly regulated through the &#x003b2;-catenin expression. We found that CuB significantly inhibited the expression of MMP-2 in both A549 and H1299 cells. E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin adhesion complex is critical for cell-cell adhesion and maintenance of normal and malignant tissue architecture. Loss of E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin expression has been correlated with invasive phenotype in NSCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We analyzed the effect of CuB treatment on the expression of E-cadherin and significant upregulation of E-cadherin expression was observed in case of both NSCLC cell lines. We also assessed the effect of CuB treatment on the cellular expression of other &#x003b2;-catenin target proteins such as MYC and Cyclin D1 in NSCLC cells. The expressions of pluripotency gene MYC and cellular proliferation marker Cyclin D1 were significantly downregulated with CuB treatment in both A549 and H1299 cells. Overexpression of &#x003b2;-catenin has been reported to induce VEGF expression, thereby augmenting tumor angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Survivin is an angiogenesis-related protein, downstream to &#x003b2;-catenin, which promotes VEGF-induced tumor angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. CuB treatment led to significant downregulation of survivin expression in NSCLC cells. In accordance, CuB also inhibited VEGF expression significantly in both A549 and H1299 cells (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C,D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the downregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling axis bestows the anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic behavior on CuB against NSCLC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CuB inhibits TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced migration in A549 cells</title><p>We used TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced experimental epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model to analyze higher efficiency of CuB treatment in inhibiting the NSCLC cells with highly aggressive malignant behavior. The exposure to TGF-&#x003b2;1 induces EMT in moderately metastatic NSCLC A549 cells rendering mesenchymal phenotype in otherwise epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Control A549 cells exhibited characteristic epithelial phenotype with close cell-cell contacts, whereas TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated A549 cells displayed mesenchymal morphology, as characterized by their spindle-shaped appearance with large inter-cellular spaces and loss of cell-cell contacts. CuB marginally restored the epithelial morphology in TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced A549 cells by reducing the intercellular spaces and causing cell shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Next, we performed wound healing assay in TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated A549 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B,C</xref>, A549 cells treated with TGF-&#x003b2;1 showed aggravated migratory potential than the untreated A549 cells due to their mesenchymal phenotype. Further, CuB has significantly inhibited the TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced A549 migration in a dose-dependent as well as time-dependent manner at 25&#x02009;nM and 50&#x02009;nM concentrations compared with TGF-&#x003b2;1-untreated A549 cells of epithelial morphology. EMT is associated with increased expression of mesenchymal markers and decreased expression of epithelial markers. TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced the expression of mesenchymal markers such as &#x003b2;-catenin, MMP-2 and vimentin, while downregulated the expression of epithelial marker, E-cadherin. However, CuB treatment led to the downregulation of the mesenchymal markers and increased expression of E-cadherin in this experimental EMT-model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CuB inhibits metastasis and angiogenesis in NSCLC cells via Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling</title><p>To validate the involvement of CuB-mediated inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling axis in the molecular mechanism of action of CuB, we silenced the expression of <italic>Wnt3</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> through siRNA-knockdown. The Wnt3 and Wnt3a ligands have been previously known to differentially stimulate proliferation and neurogenesis by canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A&#x02013;D</xref>, in the A549 cell transfected with control siRNA, marginal downregulation of markers of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, &#x003b2;-catenin and MMP-2 was observed, while in both <italic>Wnt3</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> siRNA-transfected A549 cells, these proteins were prominently downregulated. In the <italic>Wnt3</italic>-silenced A549 and H1299 cells, the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin and E-cadherin are comparable to their protein expressions in control-siRNA treated cells. However, in the <italic>Wnt3a</italic>-silenced NSCLC cells, the inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin expression and upregulation of E-cadherin expression is higher than the control siRNA-transfected cells. Our results suggest that the contribution of Wnt3a in the inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is higher as compared to Wnt3 in case of NSCLC. Although silencing of <italic>Wnt3/3a</italic> has been shown to alter the expression of MMP-2 and E-cadherin, CuB further pronounced the effects on these proteins. The reason behind this effect might be that CuB has been known as a potent STAT-3 inhibitor and STAT-3 regulates the expressions of both E-cadherin and MMP-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Therefore, the effects of CuB are higher in comparison to the effects of Wnt silencing, which functions exclusively through inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. We next analyzed the effects of <italic>Wnt3/3a</italic> silencing on the migratory characteristics of A549 cells and we found that these effects were comparable to that of changes in the protein expressions. <italic>Wnt3/3a</italic> silencing induced a significant decrease in the cellular migration similar to the CuB-treated control-siRNA group. The anti-migratory effects in Wnt3/3a-silenced, CuB-treated cells were comparable to the effects in either of the treatment groups (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). In H1299 cells, in addition to the inhibition of protein expression induced through <italic>Wnt3</italic> or <italic>Wnt3a</italic> silencing, CuB further downregulated the expression of proteins associated with Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Expression of E-cadherin with CuB treatment in control siRNA-transfected H1299 cells or <italic>Wnt3/3a</italic> siRNA-transfected cells was not observed, which might be due to the lower concentrations of CuB (25&#x02009;nM) used in this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A&#x02013;D</xref>).

NNK-induced CuB-treated animals showed reduction in the lung wet weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8A,B</xref>). We did not observe any metastatic lesions in other parts of the body including bone in these mice. We further assessed the effect of CuB treatment on the expression patterns of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling mediators.

Since metastases pose a potential threat for the recurrence and mortality in the lung cancer patients, development of newer potential therapeutics for metastatic lung cancer is highly required. Recently, we have shown CuB-mediated anti-lung cancer effects both <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>. CuB was found to alter the promoter methylation and histone modifications in the key tumor-related genes at nanomolar concentrations leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells as well as in NNK-induced lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In our present study, we have demonstrated that in addition to its anti-proliferative activity, CuB also possesses potential anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic activities in NSCLC.</p><p>We found that CuB inhibited the migration and invasion of moderately metastatic as well as highly metastatic NSCLC cells, at sub-toxic concentrations of nanomolar range through inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. The stem cell-like populations present in the cancer cell pools are characterized by the formation of <italic>in vitro</italic> tumorspheres and colonies. Studies have reported that the inhibition of stemness of cancer cells reduces the chemo-resistance and aggressiveness of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. CuB treatment potentially inhibited the stemness of the human NSCLC cells at very low concentrations. &#x003b2;-catenin is a central regulator of development, stem cell characteristics as well as cancer metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In the epithelial cells, &#x003b2;-catenin regulates the cell growth and intracellular adhesion by functioning as a component of cadherin protein complexes. Due to its central role in the regulation of metastatic, stem-cell specific and angiogenesis-related pathways, we analyzed the effect of CuB treatment on the expression as well as nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in NSCLC cells. Interestingly, CuB inhibited both the expression and the nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in NSCLC.</p><p>Canonical Wnt signaling includes the activation of &#x003b2;-catenin downstream pathway by different Wnt ligands. Wnt3 and Wnt3a are important Wnt ligands which have been shown to be upregulated in case of NSCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. These ligands bind with FZD-7 receptor and activate the downstream &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. We found that the expressions of both Wnt3 and Wnt3a were inhibited by the CuB treatment. We observed that the expression of FZD-7 receptor was significantly higher in the CuB-treated NSCLC cells. FZD-7 is a seven-pass transmembrane receptor, which belongs to G-protein coupled cell surface receptor (GPCR) family. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the members of GPCR family have the potential to remain active even in the absence of their ligand. Receptor density has been positively correlated to spontaneous activity and various classes of GPCRs have been shown to display constitutive activity upon overexpression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Therefore, the CuB-mediated FZD-7 overexpression could probably be a defence mechanism of the NSCLC cell lines to overcome the loss of Wnt3/3a ligands. Cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin remains sequestrated in the multi-enzyme degradation complex, of which GSK-3 is an important constituent. GSK-3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-mediated &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation leads to its ubiquitination followed by proteasomal degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. We found that CuB inhibits the inactivating phosphorylations of both GSK-3&#x003b1; and GSK-3&#x003b2; in NSCLC cells. In addition, the expression of GSK-3&#x003b1; and GSK-3&#x003b2; was found to be upregulated in both A549 and H1299 cells following CuB exposure. Previous studies have also shown that the upregulation of GSK-3 might also lead to activation of apoptotic signaling in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. The significantly lower phosphorylation as well as significantly higher GSK-3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; expression in these two NSCLC cells might be the reason for the loss of &#x003b2;-catenin expression in these cells. Wnt3/3a binding to FZD-7 receptors leads to the inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2;-mediated phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin by displacing GSK-3&#x003b2; from the &#x003b2;-catenin degradation complex. These &#x003b2;-catenin molecules get accumulated in the cytoplasm and then are translocated into the nucleus, where they stimulate the expression of genes related to cellular proliferation (Cyclin D1), stem cell characteristics (MYC), metastasis (MMPs and E-cadherin) as well as angiogenesis (Survivin and VEGF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. CuB-mediated inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling further reduces the expression of MMP-2, Cyclin D1, MYC, Survivin and VEGF; and induces E-cadherin expression, thereby hindering the metastatic and stemness behavior of human NSCLC. Further, siRNA transfection of <italic>Wnt3/3a</italic> validated the involvement of canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the CuB-mediated anti-metastatic effects. Interaction of &#x003b2;-catenin with TCF-1 is an essential step in Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, which leads to upregulation of downstream genes. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-1 complex also validated CuB-mediated downregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Thus, our findings are in accordance with previous studies, where inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin expression and nuclear localization has been shown to downregulate MMPs, further inhibiting tumor cell migration and tumor angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p><p>E-Cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex plays an important role in maintaining the epithelial phenotype and disruption of this complex not only affects the cell-cell adhesion, but also the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The increase in the nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin has been correlated with decreased E-cadherin expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. CuB induced the expression of E-cadherin in the NSCLC cells, thereby inhibiting the migratory characteristics of these cells. Survivin, a downstream target of &#x003b2;-catenin, further regulates the expression of VEGF, thereby affecting tumor angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. CuB was found to inhibit the expressions of both Survivin and VEGF, which correlates well with the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic characteristics of this compound. We observed that CuB was more potent in the H1299 cells with mesenchymal morphology as compared to the A549 cells, which display epithelial morphology. TGF-&#x003b2;1 has previously been reported to induce EMT in A549 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. &#x003b2;-catenin plays an important role in the TGF-&#x003b2;1-dependent induction of EMT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In the absence of TGF-&#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;-catenin is rapidly degraded following contact disassembly from the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex. However, in presence of TGF-&#x003b2;1, this dissociated &#x003b2;-catenin is stabilized in the cytoplasm, making it available for nuclear import<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Therefore, we utilized the TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced experimental EMT model to analyze if the morphology of cancer cells affects the potentiality of CuB treatment. Interestingly, CuB was found to be more effective in inhibiting the migratory abilities of TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced A549 cells with mesenchymal characteristics. We found higher inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin downstream signaling in TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced CuB-treated A549 cells.</p><p>Tumor angiogenesis is another important event during metastatic progression, in which the tumor cells induce the formation of new blood vessels in and around the primary tumor.

CuB was found to inhibit the migratory and invasive characteristics of endothelial HUVECs. In addition, CuB also disrupted the formation of tubular structures in HUVECs <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as reduced the pre-existing vasculature <italic>ex vivo</italic>. The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> anti-angiogenic effects of CuB were validated <italic>in vivo</italic>, where CuB inhibited the microvessel formation in the matrigel plug injected into the mammary fat pad of Balb/C mice more potentially than imatinib, a standard anti-angiogenic drug.

After incubation in blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk or 2% BSA in TBST) for 1&#x02009;h, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies specific for Wnt3/3a (Abcam: ab172612), Fzd-7 (Sigma-aldrich: AV41251), phospho-GSK-3&#x003b1; (Cell Signaling Technology: 9337), GSK-3&#x003b1; (Abcam: ab40870), phospho-GSK-3&#x003b2; (Santa Cruz: SC-11757), GSK-3&#x003b2; (Abcam: ab18893), &#x003b2;-catenin (Invitrogen: 71-2700), TCF-1 (Life Technologies: A13969), MMP-2 (Cell Signaling Technology: 4022S), E-cadherin (Santa cruz: SC-8426), COX-2 (Millipore: AB5118), MYC (Millipore: 06-340), Cyclin D1 (Santa cruz: SC-8396), Survivin (Cell Signaling Technology: 2808S), VEGF (Santa cruz: S C-53462), Vimentin (Santa cruz: SC-6260), PCNA (Santa cruz: SC-7907) and &#x003b2;-actin (Cell Signaling Technology: 4970L). The blots were then incubated with specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and bands were visualized using ECL (Millipore) on ImageQuant LAS4010 chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare, Amarsham, UK). The band intensities were quantified using ImageJ 1.46r software.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>Female, 5&#x02013;6 weeks-old A/J mice were procured and the study was conducted according to the guidelines as well as protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC), CSIR-CDRI, India. Briefly, after one week of acclimatization, mice were randomly divided into four groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8); three groups were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100&#x02009;mg/Kg body weight (b.w.) NNK dissolved in saline (Sigma). On third week onwards, NNK-administered mice were treated with 0.1 or 0.2&#x02009;mg/Kg b.w. of CuB i.p. twice a week, as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, except that in this study, the CuB treatment was continued throughout the study period. At 21<sup>st</sup> week, mice were sacrificed and lungs were examined for tumor incidence, multiplicity and lung wet weight. Lung tissues from each group were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and were also fixed in 10% of neutral buffered formalin for histopathological and immunofluorescence analyses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> matrigel plug assay</title><p>Animals were randomly segregated into four groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6). Matrigel (400&#x02009;&#x003bc;L) was injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pads of female Balb/c mice forming semi-solid plugs. Two groups received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg and 0.2&#x02009;mg/kg of CuB thrice a week for 7 days. A group of animals was injected with imatinib (50&#x02009;mg/Kg i.p.) as a positive control. On day 7, after anesthetizing the animals, matrigel plugs were excised and fixed in PBS-buffered 10% formalin and then stored for further processing. Following deparaffinization and dehydration, tissue samples were stained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin stains (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich). The sections were photographed using Nikon&#x02019;s Eclipse TS100 microscope equipped with a digital camera. For each group, sections from at least three mice (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) were examined for H&#x00026;E staining.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical significance of differences between the values of treated samples and controls were determined by One-way ANOVA with Dunnet&#x02019;s post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows software.
