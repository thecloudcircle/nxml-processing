This rapid onset of action makes ketamine a highly attractive drug for patients, particularly those who do not typically respond to therapy. A recent study suggested that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 may underlie the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine, although the precise mechanisms are unclear.

In the open field test, there was no difference between the four groups (control+vehicle, CMS+vehicle, CMS+ketamine, CMS+SB216763). In the sucrose intake test, a 1% sucrose intake drop, seen in CMS mice, was significantly attenuated after a single dose of ketamine, but not SB216763. In the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), the increased immobility time seen in CMS mice was significantly attenuated by a single dose of ketamine, but not SB216763. Interestingly, the ketamine-induced increase in the sucrose intake test persisted for 8 days after a single dose of ketamine.

This effect was detectable at 24 hours, and interestingly, in CMS-induced anhedonia, it was still detectable 8 days after a single dose of ketamine. Li et al. <xref rid="pone.0056053-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> reported that in the sucrose preference test, ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated anhedonia in rats under the CMS model (21 days), and that it produced a long-lasting (up to 7 days) increase in sucrose preference, relative to untreated CMS rats. The rapid and long-term antidepressant effects of ketamine in this CMS model are similar in time course to the therapeutic effects seen patients with refractory MDD and bipolar depression <xref rid="pone.0056053-Berman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056053-Zarate3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>SB216763, a potent and selective GSK-3 inhibitor is reported to cross the blood-brain barrier after i.p. administration <xref rid="pone.0056053-Selenica1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Furthermore, SB216763 (2.5&#x02013;7.5 mg/kg) attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity <xref rid="pone.0056053-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, but only partially attenuated hyperactivity produced by SKF-82958 <xref rid="pone.0056053-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These results suggest that systemic administration of SB216763 could inhibit GSK-3 in the brain. However, we could find no antidepressant effect for SB216763 in the mouse CMS model and control mice, although the dose used in this study could cause GSK-3 inhibition in the brain. A recent study showed that intracerebroventricular injection of SB216763 attenuated behavioral abnormalities (e.g., locomotion, rotarod performance, prepulse inhibition, novel object recognition, and duration of loss of righting reflex) in mice that had been administered ketamine <xref rid="pone.0056053-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, suggesting that SB216763 is capable of blocking the effects of ketamine in mice. Taken together, it is unlikely that a direct inhibition of GSK-3 is involved in the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine in the CMS mouse model, although a further study using lower doses is needed.</p><p>Previous reports showed that the selective, brain-permeable GSK-3 inhibitor, AR-A014418, decreased FST immobility time in control rats <xref rid="pone.0056053-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, treatment with AR-A014418 resulted in a spontaneous and generalized reduction in locomotor activity in mice, indicating that this induced reduction in activity constitutes its therapeutic action <xref rid="pone.0056053-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The effects of AR-A014418 were detectable as early as 30 minutes after a single dosing, although behavioral tests were not performed until 24 hours after dosing <xref rid="pone.0056053-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In this study, we found no antidepressant effect for ketamine or SB216763 in control mice, at the 30 minute time point, after a single dosing, in contrast with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0056053-KaidanovichBeilin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056053-Rosa1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The reasons for this discrepancy are currently unclear. However, we found that ketamine, but not SB21673, showed antidepressant activity in control mice 24 hours after a single administration, suggesting that ketamine induces long-lasting antidepressant effects in control mice.</p><p>In this study, no acute experiments using SB216763 in the CMS model were performed within the earlier time frame, after a single dosing. Therefore, it would be interesting to examine the earlier time effects of ketamine and SB216763 in the CMS model. It would also be intriguing to examine whether chronic administration of SB216763 exerts an antidepressant effect in the CMS model. As mentioned previously, the effects of ketamine were detectable from 24 hours to 8 days after a single dosing, even though ketamine would no longer be present in the body, due to rapid clearance <xref rid="pone.0056053-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Although this possibility was raised by Beurel et al. <xref rid="pone.0056053-Beurel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, we could find no evidence of an antidepressant-like effect for SB216763 in the CMS mouse model and control mice. It was reported that ketamine increases the phosphorylation of GSK-3, and that mice with a knock-in mutation that blocks this phosphorylation, do not respond to ketamine in a depression model <xref rid="pone.0056053-Beurel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that the NMDA receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine and dizocilpine, transiently could increase GSK-3&#x003b2; activity and increase the active (phosphor-tyrosine-216) forms of GSK-3&#x003b2; and decrease the inactive (phospho-serine-9) forms in the rat forebrain <xref rid="pone.0056053-Elyaman1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056053-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Further detailed studies are therefore, required to determine the mechanisms underlying the induction of GSK-3 phosphorylation by ketamine.</p><p>In the two experiments (CMS model and control mice), the immobility time of TST and FST was different (ures 2 and 4). It is well known that behavioral results using TST and FST could be affected by a number of variability factors (e.g., season, circadian rhythm, environmental of the laboratory, gender, housing of animals, observer, strain, test/retest)<xref rid="pone.0056053-PetitDemouliere1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this study, these two experiments were performed in different laboratory rooms and different seasons, and were also performed by different observers. Therefore, these factors may contribute to this difference of the immobility time for two experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, these findings show that while ketamine produces a rapid and enduring antidepressant effect in the CMS mouse model, the GSK-3 inhibitor, SB216763, does not. It is therefore unlikely that within the CMS model, a direct inhibition of GSK-3 may underlie the antidepressant mechanisms of ketamine.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0056053-Sanacora1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
