There is an acute need for new anti-mycobacterial drugs with novel targets. We previously evaluated a series of 2-aminothiazoles with activity against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. In this study, we identify the glycolytic enzyme enolase as the target of these molecules using pull down studies. We demonstrate that modulation of the level of enolase expression affects sensitivity to 2-aminothiazoles; increased expression leads to resistance while decreased protein levels increase sensitivity. Exposure to 2-aminothiazoles results in increased levels of metabolites preceding the action of enolase in the glycolytic pathway and decreased ATP levels. We demonstrate that 2-aminothiazoles inhibit the activity of the human &#x003b1;-enolase, which could also account for the cytotoxicity of some of those molecules. If selectivity for the bacterial enzyme over the human enzyme could be achieved, enolase would represent an attractive target for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> drug discovery and development efforts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anti-bacterial activity</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>drug target</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>drug target discovery</kwd><kwd>anti-tubercular</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000060</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000865</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a deadly global disease and continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2017</xref>). After decades of neglect, there has been a renewed effort in recent years to develop new vaccine and treatment candidates for TB. Drug-sensitive strains can currently be cured with a 6-month combination therapy of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PYR), and ethambutol (EMB) for 2 months, followed by INH and RIF for an additional 4 months (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison and Davies, 2012</xref>). With the emergence of both multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains, this regimen is becoming increasingly ineffective. Treating MDR and XDR strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is very difficult, requiring therapeutic regimens lasting up to 2 years and consisting of more toxic and costly second- and third-line drugs, with often limited success. The discovery and development of new TB drugs with novel mechanisms of action is crucial to our ability to fight this increasing global health threat.</p><p>High-throughput screening of diverse chemical libraries has successfully identified a number of compounds with excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> including the 2-aminothiazoles (2-ATs) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ananthan et al., 2009</xref>). Previous work by our group assessed the structure activity relationships (SARs) of this series to identify compounds with good activity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and selectivity over mammalian cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kesicki et al., 2016</xref>). Compounds were rapidly bactericidal and had limited broad-spectrum activity, with some efficacy against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kesicki et al., 2016</xref>). On the basis of these promising findings, we applied a mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics approach to identify the target of 2-ATs in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The SAR studies completed previously allowed for identification of appropriate residues for coupling the selected small molecule to an affinity matrix with minimal effect on activity of the molecule. We could then utilize this immobilized small molecule to identify the specific interacting protein(s) from a cell lysate. From these studies, we identified enolase as a potential target of 2-ATs in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. We used a variety of methods to validate this target in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> including both overexpression and underexpression of enolase, metabolomics, measurement of intracellular ATP, and enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Microbial Strain Description and Culture Details</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains used are summarized in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium containing 10% v/v OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase) supplement (Becton Dickinson) and 0.05% w/v Tween-80.

For LC/MS, the platform was based on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer, which consisted of an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and linear ion-trap (LIT) mass analyzer. The sample extract was divided into two aliquots, dried, and then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations. One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion optimized conditions and the other using basic negative ion optimized conditions in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns. Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were gradient eluted using water and methanol both containing 0.1% formic acid, while the basic extracts, which also used water/methanol, contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion. For GC/MS the samples were re-dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 24 h prior to being derivatized under dried nitrogen using bistrimethyl-silyl-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). The GC column was 5% phenyl and the temperature ramp was from 40&#x000b0; to 300&#x000b0;C in a 16-min period. Samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization.</p><p>Proprietary software was used to match ions to an in-house library of standards for metabolite identification and metabolite quantification by peak area (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Dehaven et al., 2010</xref>).

Multiples studies have demonstrated the essentiality of enolase for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> using Himar1 transposon mutagenesis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sassetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Griffin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dejesus et al., 2017</xref>). Enolase catalyzes the reversible dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate and participates in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The enzyme is present in a wide variety of organisms and is, like many glycolytic enzymes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fothergill-Gilmore and Michels, 1993</xref>), highly conserved. Recent work suggests that although enolase may be highly conserved across many different organisms, it could be possible to engineer inhibitors with enough specificity to ensure that human cells would not be affected (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of enolase in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> results in resistance to 2-ATs. This is true even when the plasmid is present but not induced with ATc, so that the amount of additional enolase produced is reduced. This suggests that small changes in the amount of enolase available can have drastic effects on the viability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the presence of 2-aminothiazole inhibitors. Conversely, we show that reducing the amount of enolase in the cells by modulating protein stability leads to increased susceptibility of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to 2-ATs. This is likely due to the impact of decreased enolase on glycolysis within the cell leading to more rapid decreases in ATP production, as ATP levels are severely impacted by 2-ATs in wild-type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> incubated with 2-ATs.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate the inhibition of human &#x003b1;-enolase by 2-ATs. We were interested in determining if there was cross-reactivity between our inhibitors and human &#x003b1;-enolase, since this could be the mechanism of cytotoxicity for these molecules. The lack of a fully active purified <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> enolase precluded our ability to evaluate their activity against the bacterial enzyme directly. The compounds with inhibitory activity against the human enzyme were also demonstrated to inhibit growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and MICs were impacted by the level of enolase expression. This suggests that these molecules are interacting with enolase inside of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Further work to determine if it is possible to identify 2-aminothiazole analogs that selectively target <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> enolase over its human counterpart could be beneficial.</p><p>Enolase may be most well-known for its role in glycolysis, but much recent work has been focused on its important roles in several other biological and pathophysiological processes. Several glycolytic enzymes are known to be expressed on the surface of some microorganisms (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Winram and Lottenberg, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lahteenmaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Holt, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fulde et al., 2014</xref>). These surface localized enzymes are termed moonlighting proteins because of their non-glycolytic functions. Enolase is one of the most widely studied moonlighting proteins in pathogenic microbes, demonstrated to be exported to the surface of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann et al., 2001</xref><italic>), Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Carneiro et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2008</xref>), Group A streptococci (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Pancholi and Fischetti, 1997</xref>), and several others including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Rahi et al., 2017</xref>). For most of these organisms, binding of enolase to host plasminogen has been the primary moonlighting function of enolase that has been characterized. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> enolase binds to plasminogen in a lysine-mediated manner (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Rahi et al., 2017</xref>).
