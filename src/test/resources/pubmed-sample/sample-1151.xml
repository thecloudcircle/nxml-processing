It induces an increase of calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which produces ER stress. On the other hand, different studies show that, in diseases such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s, there exist disturbances in protein folding where ER plays an important role. The objective of this study was to evaluate the state of chronic oxidative stress on ER stress and its relationship with apoptotic death in the hippocampus of rats exposed to low doses of ozone. We used 108 male Wistar rats randomly divided into five groups. The groups received one of the following treatments: (1) Control (air); (2) Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) 7 days; (3) O<sub>3</sub> 15 days; (4) O<sub>3</sub> 30 days; (5) O<sub>3</sub> 60 days; and (6) O<sub>3</sub> 90 days. Two hours after each treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the hippocampus was extracted. Afterwards, the tissue was processed for western blot and immunohistochemistry using the following antibodies: ATF6, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and caspase 12. It was also subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and electronic microscopy. Our results show an increase in ATF6, GRP78 and caspase 12 as well as ER ultrastructural alterations and an increase of TUNEL positive cells after 60 and 90 days of exposure to ozone. With the obtained results, we can conclude that oxidative stress induced by chronic exposure to low doses of ozone leads to ER stress. ER stress activates ATF6 inducing the increase of GRP78 in the cytoplasm, which leads to the increase in the nuclear translocation of ATF6. Finally, the translocation creates a vicious cycle that, together with the activation of the cascade for apoptotic cell death, contributes to the maintenance of ER stress. These events potentially contribute in the neurodegeneration processes in diseases like AD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ozone</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum stress</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Direcci&#x000f3;n General de Apoyo al Personal Acad&#x000e9;mico</funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">IN221114</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="4908"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Environmental pollution has become a world public health issue while ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is one of the main photochemical air pollutants. The chronic exposure to low doses of O<sub>3</sub> causes a state of oxidative stress in the brain of rats. Additionally, it produces alterations in the endogenous antioxidant systems as well as an increase in the levels of proteins and oxidized lipids (Rivas-Arancibia et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; G&#x000f3;mez-Cris&#x000f3;stomo et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Polj&#x00161;ak and Fink, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, lipid oxidation and cell membrane proteins cause disturbances in the permeability of the membrane, leading to an increase of the ions within the cell. Calcium is one of the most abundant ions in the organisms and extracellular liquid. Intracellular calcium is finely regulated since it activates a number of signaling pathways including apoptotic cell death pathways. During the chronic state of oxidative stress there is a calcium entry into the cell and into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), one of the organelles in charge of maintaining the intracellular calcium homeostasis along with the mitochondrion.</p><p>On the other hand, the ER is involved in a number of cell functions such as: quality control of protein synthesis, post-translational modification and protein folding. These processes are regulated by different enzymes (Paschen and Doutheil, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Ellgaard and Helenius, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Anelli and Sitia, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), also known as molecular chaperones, are proteins in the ER that respond to different calcium concentrations and are involved in new protein folding (Corbett and Michalak, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Molinari and Helenius, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). For instance, the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP)/78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), an ER chaperone regulating those pathways, is bound to three transmembrane ER proteins: ATF6, inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (IRE1a) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK; Kincaid and Cooper, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The binding of BiP/GRP78 to such transmembrane proteins takes place in the ER as a response to calcium stress (Li et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Furthermore, these transmembrane proteins regulate cell death along with the massive calcium entry through both the activating factors at transcriptional level (CHOP or XBP1) and the caspases activation in response to an extended ER stress (Lin et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; White-Gilbertson et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). During ER stress, BiP/GRP78 triggers a series of events that lead to the nuclear translocation of ATF6 (Haze et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). ATF6 is a type II transmembrane protein with a C-terminal located in the ER lumen and an N-terminal in the cytosol (Ye et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>If the ER eventually shows chronic stress and does not manage to recover homeostasis, it triggers cell apoptosis via caspases activation. Among these caspases, caspase 12 is one of the enzymes involved in the cell death cascade. Caspase 12 is located in the outer ER membrane activated by ER stress (Nakagawa et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Yoneda et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and is expressed in cortical and hippocampal neurons (Shimoke et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Dlugos, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Caspase 12 activates caspase 3 (Mehmet, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Hitomi et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), leading to apoptotic death. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of chronic oxidative stress on ER stress and its relationship with apoptotic death in the hippocampus of rats repeatedly exposed to low doses of ozone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Animal care and handling were in accordance with the Norma Official Mexicana NOM-036-SSA2-2002 and approved by the Institutional Committee for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals (CICUAL), of the Medicine School at the Universidad Nacional Aut&#x000f3;noma de M&#x000e9;xico.</p><p>One hundred eight Wistar male rats weighing 250&#x02013;300 g were individually housed in acrylic boxes with free access to water and food (Purina, Minnetonka, MN, USA) and were kept in a room with clean air.

Each group received one of the following treatments: Control (exposed to ozone-free air), 7, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days of ozone exposure (daily exposure to 0.25 ppm of ozone for 4 h; Rivas-Arancibia et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Immediately after the ozone exposure was completed, animals were returned to their home cages. Two hours after the last air or ozone exposure, all the animals were deeply anesthetized using 50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital, and put to death. The brain was removed and the hippocampus of each animal was dissected, isolated and analyzed using one of the following techniques: (1) Western blot for evaluation of ATF6, GRP/78 and caspase 12 (<italic>n</italic> = 6); (2) Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and immunohistochemistry for ATF6, GRP/78 and caspase 12; and (3) Electron microscopy (<italic>n</italic> = 6).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ozone Exposure</title><p>Animals were placed inside a chamber with an air diffuser connected to a variable-flux ozone generator (5 L/s).

A decrease in the quantity of membrane-bound ribosomes was observed with respect to the control group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of chronic exposure to ozone on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in rat hippocampus.</bold> Electron micrographs of rat hippocampus exposed to ozone. <bold>(A)</bold> Control, <bold>(B)</bold> 60D, <bold>(C)</bold> 90D. <bold>(A)</bold> The micrograph shows the ER of normal appearance with associated ribosomes. <bold>(B,C)</bold> show damage and swelling of ER (broad arrow) and loss of continuity in the membranes of ER (arrowhead) after 60 days and 90 days of exposure to ozone 40,000&#x000d7;.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnagi-08-00245-g0005"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The repeated exposure to low doses of ozone produces a state of chronic oxidative stress, causing damage and cell death (Rivas-Arancibia et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The increase of oxidative stress is accompanied by calcium entry into the cell. In response to the cell stress caused by changes in the calcium concentration either exposure to free radicals or glucose decrease, ER stress is produced, leading to alterations in functions and build-up of misfolded proteins in the ER (Ozcan and Tabas, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In consequence, signaling pathways known as response to misfolded proteins are activated. This response has been interpreted as a compensation mechanism to correct the alteration (Paschen and Doutheil, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). However, when ER stress is maintained, a greater quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated. This has an impact in the control of the levels of misfolded proteins in the ER, leading to damage in the cell functions (Chao et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results show a significant increase of both ATF6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and GRP78 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) at 60 and 90 days of exposure to ozone. It is known that the response control to misfolded proteins in ER stress is mainly regulated by GRP78 and ATF6 (Kincaid and Cooper, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This shows that oxidative stress produced by ozone induces an increase of GRP78. The increase may activate the nuclear translocation of ATF6 in response to misfolded proteins as observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Additionally, GRP78 dissociation promotes ATF6 activation and the subsequent activation of genes with the capability to re-establish folding during ER stress (Fonseca et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In our results we see a non-significant increase in the expression of GRP78 and ATF6 from 7 to 30 days of exposure to ozone. During these periods of time, the cells are still able to compensate the damage produced by chronic exposure to low doses of ozone. However, despite the significant increase in GRP78 and ATF6, the system is unable to reverse or compensate the damage produced at 60 and 90 days of exposure, leading to cell death from apoptosis, induced by changes in calcium in the ER; the changes result in the activation of caspase 12. This shows that the increase in caspase-12 expression at 90 days of exposure to ozone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is related to the increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) where it is evident that the system cannot fight the damage produced by chronic exposure to low doses of ozone. On the other hand, the ozone not only induces changes at a molecular lever but also ER ultrastructural alterations. Our results show ER membrane dilation as well as a decrease in the membrane-bound ribosomes from 60 to 90 days of exposure to the gas (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,C</xref>). The morphological alterations are the final result of important failures in the molecular, biochemical and physiological mechanisms of the cell (Chang, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). In contrast, the loss of calcium homeostasis is the most immediate and adverse effect caused by oxidative stress induced by exposure to ozone.</p><p>The results indicate that ER stress may be playing an important role in the apoptotic damage induced by chronic exposure to low doses of ozone, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> where it is seen that ER stress induces caspase-12 release.</p><p>Based on these data, we propose that ozone causes ER stress, which induces an increase of caspase 12 and neuronal cell death. Both the oxidative stress and ER damage have been associated to a wide number of degenerative diseases including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD). It is known that environmental pollution directly impacts health; however, there are few studies dedicated to clarifying the role ozone plays in the neurodegeneration processes and its possible participation in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer&#x02019;s. This study demonstrates that the exposure to low doses of ozone has a deleterious effect by inducing a state of oxidative stress which, in turn, leads to the activation of apoptotic death mediated by ER stress. This may contribute to the maintenance and progression of the chronic process of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&#x02019;s patients.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>ER-M was involved in the immunohistochemistry, western blot, TUNEL, electron microscospy techniques and in writing the article draft.
