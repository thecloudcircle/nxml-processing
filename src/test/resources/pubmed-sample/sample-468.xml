Although the role of several cell adhesion, migration or proliferation molecules in metastasis is established, a novel target for cancer therapy remains to be discovered. Previously, we reported that <italic>fad104</italic> (factor for adipocyte differentiation 104), a regulatory factor of adipogenesis, regulates cell adhesion and migration. In this report, we clarify the role of <italic>fad104</italic> in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The expression level of <italic>fad104</italic> in highly metastatic melanoma A375SM cells was lower than that in poorly metastatic melanoma A375C6 cells. Reduction of <italic>fad104</italic> expression enhanced the migration and invasion of melanoma cells, while over-expression of FAD104 inhibited migration and invasion. In addition, melanoma cells stably expressing FAD104 showed a reduction in formation of lung colonization compared with control cells. FAD104 interacted with STAT3 and down-regulated the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in melanoma cells. These findings together demonstrate that <italic>fad104</italic> suppressed the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells by inhibiting activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings will aid a comprehensive description of the mechanism that controls the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS): (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/">http://www.jsps.go.jp/</ext-link>), 21390024 (MI), Aichi Cancer Research Foundation: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acrf.or.jp/">http://www.acrf.or.jp/</ext-link>) (MN), and The Research Foundation for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www15.ocn.ne.jp/~yakusho/">http://www15.ocn.ne.jp/~yakusho/</ext-link>) (MN).

Approximately 90% of all cancer deaths arise from the invasion and metastatic spread of primary tumors. Melanoma is one of the most lethal forms of skin cancer. Although it is a relatively rare cancer, its incidence has increased rapidly in the last few decades [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117197.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. If diagnosed early, melanoma is well curable by surgical resection. However, the lethality of melanoma is high because of its high metastatic potential. Therefore, clarification of the mechanisms by which the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells are regulated is essential for the development of more effective therapies. Although it is known that the factors that regulate cell adhesion and migration are involved in the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells, little is known about the molecular mechanism of invasion and metastasis.</p><p>Previously, to elucidate the mechanism of adipocyte differentiation, we isolated several novel genes whose expression was up-regulated in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) subtraction method [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117197.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Factor for adipocyte differentiation</italic> (<italic>Fad) 24</italic>, <italic>fad49</italic>, <italic>fad158</italic>, <italic>peg10</italic> and <italic>fad104</italic> were shown to promote the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The expression of <italic>fad104</italic>, a novel gene isolated by the PCR subtraction method, is transiently increased during adipogenesis. FAD104 has a proline-rich region, nine fibronectin type III domains and a transmembrane region. <italic>Fad104</italic> is known to be a member of the fibronectin type III domain containing protein (fndc) 3 family comprising <italic>fndc3a</italic>, <italic>b and c. Fad104</italic> corresponds to <italic>fndc3b</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that <italic>fad104</italic> positively regulated adipogenesis but negatively regulated osteoblast differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We also reported that <italic>fad104</italic>-deficient mice died at birth because of lung abnormalities [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117197.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These results show that <italic>fad104</italic> is important to regulate not only adipogenesis but also lung maturation and ossification. Moreover, in addition to these findings, analyses using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed that loss of <italic>fad104</italic> suppressed cell adhesion, migration and proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These results suggest that <italic>fad104</italic> has essential roles in biological phenomena required for cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. Change of the potential for cell adhesion and migration is important for the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. These findings have raised the question of whether <italic>fad104</italic> regulates the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells and prompted us to investigate its role in regulating malignant phenotypes of cancer cells.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the function of <italic>fad104</italic> in the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells. The expression of <italic>fad104</italic> in highly metastatic melanoma cells was lower than that in poorly metastatic cells. In addition, <italic>fad104</italic> negatively regulated the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells. Furthermore, FAD104 interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and inhibited STAT3 activity. These findings indicate that <italic>fad104</italic> suppresses STAT3 signaling and controls the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>The A375SM and A375C6 melanoma cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Saotomo Ito and Dr. Hidetoshi Hayashi (Nagoya City University, Aichi, Japan) [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The development of metastatic disease is highly complex. Tumor cells detach from the primary tumor mass; migrate and invade through the extracellular matrix, basement membrane and endothelial wall; and circulate in the vascular system, before establishing themselves in the target organ [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. STAT3 is constitutively activated at 50&#x02013;90% frequency in diverse human cancers. In fact, the majority of melanoma cell lines and tumor specimens display constitutively activated STAT3 [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is reported that the inhibition of STAT3 activity by JSI-124 (cucurbitacin I), an inhibitor of STAT3, suppressed tumor growth of B16F10 melanoma cells [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, dominant negative STAT3 attenuates the potency of invasion and metastasis of melanoma [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, regulation of STAT3 activity may enhance the efficacy of melanoma therapy. Here, we showed that FAD104 interacted with STAT3 and suppressed the phosphorylation level of STAT3. Therefore, FAD104 may mask the STAT3 phosphorylation site. It is necessary to reveal the region of STAT3 that is important for interaction with FAD104. Moreover, activation of STAT3 is tightly controlled by various molecules, such as protein tyrosine phosphatases (e.g. PTPMeg2), inhibitory factors (e.g. protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS)), and negative feedback factors (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)) [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

In melanoma cells, in addition to STAT3, various transcription factors such as the p53 family, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B), activating transcription factor-1/2 (ATF-1/2), cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) protein and activator protein-2&#x003b1; (AP-2&#x003b1;) directly control the expression of genes contributing to adhesion, migration, matrix degradation and cell survival [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, we need to perform the promoter analyses to clarify whether these factors regulate the expression of <italic>fad104</italic>. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses should be performed to investigate the role of <italic>fad104</italic> in metastasis.</p><p>MMP2 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family which consists of zinc-dependent enzymes that degrades different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. MMP2 is often over-expressed in malignant tumors. It is reported that MMP2 was frequently associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis in melanoma [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Here, we showed that the over-expression of FAD104 decreased the expression of <italic>mmp2. Mmp2</italic> expression is regulated by not only STAT3 but also other transcription factors such as FoxO3a [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is necessary to examine the mechanisms by which FAD104 regulates the expression of <italic>mmp2</italic>.</p><p>We showed that <italic>fad104</italic> suppressed migration and invasion of not only melanoma cells but also breast cancer cells (<xref rid="pone.0117197.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that <italic>fad104</italic> plays an important role for regulation of migration and invasion of various cancer cells. It is necessary to clarify whether <italic>fad104</italic> regulates migration and invasion of other cancer cells such as lung and prostate cancer.</p><p>FAD104 is also known to be FNDC3B [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is reported that miRNA-143 promotes invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer cells by repression of FAD104/FNDC3B expression [<xref rid="pone.0117197.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117197.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, how FAD104/FNDC3B regulates invasion and metastasis remains unknown. In this study, we elucidated for the first time that FAD104 regulated invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells through inhibition of STAT3 activity. It is needed to clarify the mechanism by which FAD104/FNDC3B regulates invasion and metastasis of liver and prostate cancer cells. Moreover, it remains unknown whether miR-143 regulates metastasis of melanoma cells, and FAD104/FNDC3B expression. Therefore, it is definitely required to investigate the effect of miR-143 on invasion and metastasis of melanoma and breast cancer cells in future study.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that <italic>fad104</italic> suppresses the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells and is closely involved in negative regulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Further analyses of the mechanism by which <italic>fad104</italic> regulates invasion and metastasis should help to elucidate the whole picture of the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117197.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Figures A through I.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117197.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. S.
