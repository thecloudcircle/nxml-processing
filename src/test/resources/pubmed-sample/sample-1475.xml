Typically, PRA is measured by competitive radioimmunoassay, but there are significant drawbacks to this technique including non-specificity, long analysis times, narrow calibration range, and the requirement for radionucleotides. In this paper, we report a method for plasma renin activity determination by immuno-MALDI mass spectrometry detection. This method overcomes the issues of non-specificity and long analytical times present with RIA, and does not require the use of radionucleotides. As an initial methodological evaluation, plasma renin activity results obtained by radioimmunoassay, LC/ESI-MS/MS, and immuno-MALDI on 64 samples from an outpatient primary aldosteronism screening program have been compared. A strong correlation was found between immuno-MALDI and radioimmunoassay (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9412, 62/64 within the 95% CI of the Bland-Altman plot), and iMALDI and LC/ESI-MS/MS (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9471, 62/64 within the 95% CI of the Bland-Altman plot). Technical replicates showed a 4.8% CV, while inter- and intra-day replicates showed CVs of 17.3% and 17.2% respectively. We have developed an assay capable of measuring PRA without the use of radionucleotides. This immuno-MALDI approach affords the specificity of MS while avoiding the long analytical run times and technical problems associated with HPLC. With the use of robotic sample preparation to optimize precision, this assay should be adaptable to clinical environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Angiotensin-I</kwd><kwd>Plasma renin activity</kwd><kwd>PRA</kwd><kwd>iMALDI</kwd><kwd>Immuno-MALDI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hypertension is a world-wide epidemic affecting more than 1 billion people and causing 7.1 million deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The consequences of untreated hypertension include increased risk of: coronary and peripheral vascular disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal impairment. Early identification of treatable and/or curable forms of hypertension is therefore critical to the prevention of the associated chronic diseases.</p><p>Arterial blood pressure is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Dysregulation of this system leads to the development of certain hypertensive states that are responsive to surgical, vascular, or medical intervention&#x02013;most notably primary aldosteronism (PA) and renal arterial stenosis. The RAAS is regulated by renin, a proteolytic enzyme secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the renal glomerulus in response to &#x003b2;-1 adrenergic stimulation, decreased arterial blood pressure, and decreased delivery of NaCl to the macula densa. Renin cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin-I (Ang-I) from angiotensinogen, an &#x003b1;-2 globulin constitutively manufactured by the liver. Through the action of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE), Ang-I is converted to angiotensin-II (Ang-II), a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to a rapid rise in blood pressure and subsequent upregulation of aldosterone production by the adrenal glands. Both Ang-II and aldosterone then feedback to decrease plasma renin activity (PRA).</p><p>The determination of PRA is a critical tool for the screening and diagnostic process of PA and has a long history of diagnostic utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Traditionally, PRA assays have been performed using a 1-3&#x000a0;h generation of Ang-I, which is sometimes extended to 18&#x000a0;h for samples demonstrating very low activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Early assays used a pH of 7.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] which was later decreased to 5.5 - 6.0 to improve sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and angiotensinase inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The Ang-I generated was protected from proteolytic degradation either by adding an ACE/angiotensinase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or by antibody capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the generation was halted either chemically (11) or by using an ice-bath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although various immunoassay techniques for PRA have been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], radioimmunoassay (RIA) has been the mainstay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Recently, screening efforts for PA have increased as physicians became aware of its high prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This has increased the need for high-throughput methods for measuring RAAS components. Accordingly, there has been movement away from traditional PRA assays because they are not readily amenable to automation. In their place, sandwich assays measuring plasma renin concentration (PRC) have become commonplace, particularly since the development of automated chemiluminescent approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although some studies have found PRC to be an adequate substitute for PRA when calculating the aldosterone to renin ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], there are a number of arguments for retaining PRA as the method of choice. First, there is a larger body of evidence for PA screening using PRA, and PRA levels correlate better with plasma Ang-I and Ang-II. Direct comparisons of the aldosterone:PRA <italic>versus</italic> aldosterone:PRC ratios generally show that the former has higher area-under-the-ROC-curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, aldosterone:PRC may suffer from a higher false-positive rate in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Enthusiasm for the PRA assay has therefore continued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and MS-based approaches for Ang-I determination have been of great interest because of their specificity. Published MS-based methods have used solid-phase extraction (SPE) and positive ion LC/ESI-MS/MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although this approach is radionucleotide-free, LC/ESI-MS/MS requires considerable expertise and many clinical laboratories have shied away from this technique because of its technical demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, MALDI-TOF is widely used in clinical laboratories for the rapid speciation of bacteria and yeast, because of its speed, ease, robustness, and low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Because of this, we have developed a PRA assay using a MALDI platform (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This assay uses immunocapture coupled to MALDI analysis (iMALDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], is free of radionucleotides, does not require HPLC, and shows good correlation with existing clinical RIA and LC/ESI-MS/MS methods.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>iMALDI workflow.</bold> Stable-isotope labelled internal standard (SIS)-Ang-I (green) is spiked into plasma and the sample is incubated with anti-Ang-I-antibody conjugated beads.

In the iMALDI method, the amount of angiotensin present is determined by direct MALDI analysis of the affinity beads which are placed on the MALDI target without prior elution of the captured analyte.

The inter-day reproducibility of biological replicates of the LC/ESI-MS/MS assay was found to be 8.3%, 7.7%, and 9.0% CV at PRA values of 0.26, 1.34, and 5.63&#x000a0;ng/L/s respectively, as determined by a CLSI EP5-A2-compliant protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation of RIA with LC/ESI-MS/MS.</bold> PRA was determined by RIA and LC/ESI-MS/MS for 64 patients.

This iMALDI method improves on many aspects of the RIA procedure -- mainly the exclusion of radionucleotides and inaccuracies associated with antibody cross-reactivity. This method employs antigen-concentration by immunocapture, and direct elution on the MALDI target (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which reduces the risk of non-specific binding to plastics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The specificity provided by the mass spectrometer allows the accurate determination of MWs of all antibody-captured analytes, ensuring that antibody cross-reactivity does not result in analytical interferences. This specificity is important, because some between-method variability is believed to result from biologically-inactive, yet immunologically cross-reactive components present in patient plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In iMALDI, if additional components are captured by the antibody, they are detected as different components and can be accounted for (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The determination of PRA by iMALDI.

The same standard curve is used for both the generated (37&#x000b0;C) and blank (4&#x000b0;C) samples to quantitate Ang-I and to calculate PRA. The use of SIS peptides as internal standard allows MALDI, and our iMALDI approach, to be quantitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>PRA values determined by iMALDI were compared to those of RIA and LC/ESI-MS/MS. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A shows the regression relationship of iMALDI to RIA for PRA, which has a slope of 2.48. The deviation of the slope from unity can be partially explained by the substantial increase in PRA seen for incubations performed at lower pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Historically, PRA assays were performed at physiological pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.4, but this was later altered to pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.0 to increase analytical sensitivity and improve angiotensinase inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. When identical samples are run at pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.4 and pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.0, the PRA for samples run at pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.0 show roughly twice the activity of the samples run at pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The RIA assay utilized pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.4, while the iMALDI assay used pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.0. Additionally, there are slight differences observed in PRA values when plasma samples are diluted to different extents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B shows the comparison of iMALDI with LC/ESI-MS/MS, which has a slope of 1.46. Both methods were run at pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.0, but the LC/ESI-MS/MS method has an Ang-I generation time of 3&#x000a0;h, compared to a 1-h generation for the iMALDI assay. Because Ang-I generation by renin is substrate dependant, different generation times will result in different numerical PRA results with shorter incubations resulting in higher values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have developed an iMALDI assay for PRA that eliminates the use of radionucleotides and reduces the deleterious effects of antibody cross-reactivity.

With automation of sample preparation, we expect to see even further improvements in the throughput and precision of the assay.

A Strata-X 33&#x000a0;&#x003bc; polymeric reversed phase 60&#x000a0;mg 96 well plate (Phenomenex) was conditioned with 1&#x000a0;mL of methanol followed by 1&#x000a0;mL of 5% FA with vacuum applied at 200&#x000a0;mbar for 1&#x000a0;min for each condition step. The entire sample (550&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L for blank samples and 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L for 37&#x000b0;C samples) was loaded onto the plate and flowed through using vacuum applied at 200&#x000a0;mbar for 1&#x000a0;min.

Twenty microliters of sample extracts were injected onto a 50&#x000a0;mm x 2&#x000a0;mm Jupiter 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc; Proteo 90A Analytical Column (Phenomenex). Mobile phases A and B were 0.2% FA in water, and 0.2% FA in methanol, respectively. Using a 0.5&#x000a0;mL/min flow rate, Ang-I was eluted at 95% B after 0.5&#x000a0;min of column conditioning at 10% B and a gradient to 95% B in 1&#x000a0;min. The system was returned to starting conditions in 0.1&#x000a0;min and re-equilibrated at 10% B for 2.4&#x000a0;min. The total cycle time was 6&#x000a0;min per sample. Triply-charged ions 433.2&#x02192;647.5 (quantifier) and 433.2&#x02192;619.3 (qualifier) were monitored for Ang-I and 436.6&#x02192;657.5 for the SIS-Ang-I internal standard.

Beads were washed 7 times with 1&#x000a0;mL of 25% ACN/1xPBS/0.03% CHAPS, and 3 times with 1xPBS/0.03% CHAPS solution in a 1.5&#x000a0;mL Maxymum Recovery tube (Axygen Scientific). Beads were pelleted with a Dynamag-2 (Invitrogen), allowing 20&#x000a0;s to pellet the beads before removing the supernatant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conjugation of protein G dynabeads and pAb</title><p>Antibody was added to Protein G Dynabeads based on experimental need (1 plate used roughly 23&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of pAb) at a ratio of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of pAb to 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of washed beads. A solution of 1xPBS/0.03% CHAPS was added to give a final volume of 7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of liquid per 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of pAb. The sample was quickly spun to collect beads at the bottom of the tube and then lightly vortexed to resuspend them. Beads were placed on a Labquake rotor (Fisher Scientific) for 1&#x000a0;h at RT with end-over-end rotation. Following conjugation, beads were pelleted and washed 5 times with 1&#x000a0;mL of 1&#x000d7;PBS/0.03% CHAPS. Once washed, beads were resuspended in 1&#x000d7;PBS/0.03% CHAPS to a pAb concentration of 0.01&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L. Twenty &#x003bc;L of bead solution was transferred to each well of a 96-well skirted PCR plate, which results in 0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of pAb per capture well.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of angiotensin I</title><p>Plasma samples were thawed in a RT water bath for 5&#x000a0;min and then placed on ice. Before use, plasma was vortexed and a 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L aliquot was added to a 1.5-mL Maxymum Recovery tube, to give a final concentration of 5&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 25&#x000a0;mM maleic acid, 275&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M neomycin trisulphate, and 1&#x000a0;mM PMSF. The final sample pH was 6. The total volume of all inhibitors added was 12.23&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, resulting in a 6% dilution. Samples were vortexed and split into two tubes containing 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L each, representing the blank and generated sample. The blank sample was placed on ice, and the generated sample was placed in a 37&#x000b0;C thermoshake rotor (Eppendorf), shaking at 1000&#x000a0;rpm for exactly 1&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec><title>Antigen capture</title><p>Beads were pelleted in the 96 well PCR plate (Axygen) by placing it on a Dynal MPC-96S plate magnet and the supernatant was removed. Tubes were continually vortexed during Ang-I generation, and were then placed on ice. Triplicate analyses of patient blank and generated samples were added to the PCR plate (6 captures per patient). This was repeated for each patient sample, with a total of 13 patients analyzed per plate (78 wells). Triplicate six-point calibration curves at concentrations of 14.8, 7.4, 3.7, 1.9, 0.9, and 0&#x000a0;ng/mL natural Ang-I were prepared in 35&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 1&#x000d7;PBS/0.03% CHAPS. Both reference standards and patient samples were spiked with SIS Ang-I internal standard to a concentration of 4.6&#x000a0;ng/mL. After addition of the standards, samples were mixed by pipetting with an 8-channel pipette (Fisher Scientific). The PCR plate was sealed with an Axymat (Axygen), taped to a Labquake rotor, and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;h with end-over-end rotation.</p></sec><sec><title>Bead washing and MALDI spotting</title><p>Following 1&#x000a0;h of antibody capture, the plate was removed and placed on the PCR plate magnet. Using a multichannel pipette, samples were washed column by column, starting with column 1. The capture solution (plasma and standards) was removed from the pelleted beads. The PCR plate was removed from the magnet and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 15% ACN/25&#x000a0;mM ammonium bicarbonate was used to resuspend the beads. The PCR plate was placed back on the magnet and the beads were allowed to pellet for 20&#x02009;s. This was repeated an additional 2 times for a total of 3 washes. After the final wash, all buffer was removed and the plate was removed from the magnet. Beads were resuspended in 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 15%ACN/25&#x000a0;mM ammonium bicarbonate, and the entire bead solution was spotted on a MALDI target (part number: 4352802, AB SCIEX). The procedure was performed for each column separately to ensure that the time from first wash to spotting on the MALDI target was consistent across all samples. After all wells had been spotted, the plate was left at RT until all spots were dry and uniform in appearance. Two &#x003bc;L of MALDI matrix solution (containing 3&#x000a0;mg/mL CHCA, 1.8&#x000a0;mg/mL ammonium citrate, 70% ACN, and 0.1% TFA) was overspotted onto each bead spot to elute the peptide and prepare the spot for MALDI analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>MALDI analysis</title><p>Samples were analyzed on an AB SCIEX 4800 MALDI TOF-TOF using Reflector Positive mode, from m/z 800 to 4000. Samples were analyzed in batch mode, after checking before acquisition to ensure that the laser setting produced sufficient intensities for both blank and generated sample. A total of 1250 laser shots were acquired for each spot (10 sub-spectra with 125 shots per sub-spectrum) using a fixed laser intensity. Representative spectra from a 4&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C capture are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>.

Peak heights were recorded after performing a baseline correction. Two peak heights were recorded -- those of Natural Ang-I (m/z 1296.68) and SIS Ang-I (m/z 1306.68), and the relative response (RR) was reported as the Nat:SIS ratio. These RR values were compared to the calibration curve. PRA was calculated in ng/L/s by the blank subtraction method (Equation&#x000a0;1).
