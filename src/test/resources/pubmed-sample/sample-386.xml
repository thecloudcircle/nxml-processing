The biosynthetic pathway leading to plant jasmonates is initiated by 13-lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxygenation of &#x003b1;-linolenic acid into its 13-hydroperoxide derivative. A number of plant pathogenic fungi (e.g. <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>) are also capable of producing jasmonates, however, by a yet unknown biosynthetic pathway. In a search for lipoxygenase in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, a reverse genetic approach was used and one of two from the genome predicted lipoxygenases (FoxLOX) was cloned. The enzyme was heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified via affinity chromatography, and its reaction mechanism characterized. FoxLOX was found to be a non-heme iron lipoxygenase, which oxidizes C<sub>18</sub>-polyunsaturated fatty acids to 13<italic>S</italic>-hydroperoxy derivatives by an antarafacial reaction mechanism where the bis-allylic hydrogen abstraction is the rate-limiting step. With &#x003b1;-linolenic acid as substrate FoxLOX was found to exhibit a multifunctional activity, because the hydroperoxy derivatives formed are further converted to dihydroxy-, keto-, and epoxy alcohol derivatives.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by the DFG in frame of IRTG-1422 and by an ERASMUS grant for ACS.

They typically catalyze the regio- and stereospecific oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids containing a 1<italic>Z</italic>,4<italic>Z</italic>-pentadiene system to hydroperoxy derivatives <xref rid="pone.0064919-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These compounds act as precursors for further enzymatic cascades leading to a large variety of signal molecules that are named oxylipins <xref rid="pone.0064919-Brodhun1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Andreou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Funk1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Due to the important signaling functions of LOX-derived products in plants and mammals these enzymes have been intensively studied over the past decades. Crystallographic studies demonstrated that despite significant differences in size, mammalian and plant LOXes have a highly similar over-all structure <xref rid="pone.0064919-Ivanov1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>: The N-terminal region is made up by a domain that consists mainly of &#x003b2;-sheets forming a barrel-like structure. This so-called &#x003b2;-barrel domain resembles those of C2-domains known from peripheral membrane proteins where they are functioning as membrane binding sites <xref rid="pone.0064919-Corbin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The C-terminal region on the other hand forms the mainly &#x003b1;-helical catalytic domain bearing the mono-nuclear non-heme iron <xref rid="pone.0064919-Ivanov1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> which is, in case of plant LOXes, coordinated by the N-atoms of three conserved His-residues, the O-atom of one particular Asp and the carboxy terminus of the C-terminal Ile <xref rid="pone.0064919-Andreou2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In contrast, fungal LOXes have so far been described to contain manganese rather than iron in their active site <xref rid="pone.0064919-Brodhun1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The central and rate-limiting step of the LOX reaction is the stereospecific hydrogen abstraction from the bis-allylic C-atom of the pentadiene system. The resulting carbon centered radical is delocalized via the &#x003c0;- electron system and can be attacked by molecular oxygen at three theoretical positions, i.e. C-1, C-5 or C-3 <xref rid="pone.0064919-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. With 18&#x02236;2(n-6) as substrate for LOX reaction, oxygen insertion can thus take place either at the C-9, C-11 or C-13 positions of the fatty acid backbone, forming the respective 9-, 11- or 13-hydroperoxy derivatives. While oxygen insertion at C-1 and C-5, yielding mono-allylic hydroperoxides, is typically found with mammalian and plant LOXes, formation of C-3-centered bis-allylic hydroperoxides has been observed only in very few cases <xref rid="pone.0064919-Andreou3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Hamberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The comparatively unstable bis-allylic hydroperoxides have been identified as products of fungal manganese LOX (13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX) which was isolated as native protein from the fungus <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0064919-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In later studies 13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX was cloned, heterologously expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0064919-Cristea1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and characterized in-depth, demonstrating that this enzyme differs from classical LOXes in at least three aspects: (i) instead of iron 13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX contains manganese <xref rid="pone.0064919-Gaffney1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Su2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, (ii) it does not catalyze an antarafacial but a suprafacial reaction <xref rid="pone.0064919-Hamberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Oliw1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, (iii) the enzyme forms bis-allylic hydroperoxy fatty acids which can be isomerized yielding the respective 13<italic>R</italic>-hydroperoxy fatty acid derivatives with C<sub>18</sub>-polyunsaturated fatty acids as substrates <xref rid="pone.0064919-Hamberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Oliw2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

During preparation of the present manuscript, a 9<italic>S</italic>-MnLOX was the identified and characterized <xref rid="pone.0064919-Wennman2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This enzyme showed a high sequence identity (77%) towards 13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX and exhibited similar mechanistic features. It should be pointed out, that until now the two MnLOXes are the only ascomycete LOXes that have been characterized by heterelogous expression. Only very recently the first study on the recombinant expression and characterization of a LOX from the Basidiomycete <italic>Pleurotus sapidus</italic> has been reported <xref rid="pone.0064919-Plagemann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the metabolites formed by MnLOX further oxylipins have been identified in different fungal species <xref rid="pone.0064919-Noverr1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. On the one hand these data indicate that the structural diversity of fungal oxylipins is considerably high and that their biosynthetic pathways might differ significantly from those present in mammals or plants <xref rid="pone.0064919-Brodhun1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. On the other hand, however, different studies demonstrated that some plant pathogenic fungi (e.g. <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Botryodiplodia</italic>/<italic>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</italic>) are also capable of synthesizing plant specific oxylipins as for example jasmonic acid (JA) <xref rid="pone.0064919-Miersch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Miersch2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Tsukada1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Miersch3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Because this phytohormone functions as an essential signaling molecule regulating developmental processes as well as stress and defense responses in plants <xref rid="pone.0064919-Wasternack1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, these studies support the proposed role of fungal oxylipins as mimics of host metabolites <xref rid="pone.0064919-Thatcher1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A recent study on JA biosynthesis in <italic>L. theobromae</italic> indicated that fungal JA is derived from a fatty acid precursor and is formed via the intermediary formation of a cyclopentenone analogous to the plant pathway <xref rid="pone.0064919-Tsukada1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Here, JA biosynthesis starts with free &#x003b1;-linolenic acid (18&#x02236;3(n-3), <italic>x</italic>:<italic>y</italic>(n-<italic>z</italic>) denotes a fatty acid with <italic>x</italic> carbons and <italic>y</italic> double bonds in position <italic>z</italic> counting from the methyl end) that is oxidized by a 13<italic>S</italic>-LOX yielding the 13<italic>S</italic>-hydroperoxy derivative. This metabolite serves as a substrate for further sequential conversions that lead to the formation of JA. A subsequent study with <italic>L. theobromae</italic> aimed at identifying the dioxygenase responsible for the initial oxidation step in JA-biosynthetic pathway; however, the existence of plant-like JA-biosynthetic enzymes in <italic>L. theobromae</italic> could not be supported. In fact, instead an unusual 9<italic>R</italic>-dioxygenase that catalyzes the suprafacial oxidation of C<sub>18</sub>-polyunsaturated fatty acids to the corresponding 9<italic>R</italic>-hydroperoxy fatty acids was observed <xref rid="pone.0064919-Jernern1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Since 9-hydroperoxy derivatives cannot be further transformed to JA, the biosynthetic route of fungal JA-biosynthesis remains elusive.</p><p>The objective of this study was to continue the analysis of the first step of fungal JA biosynthesis using a reverse genetic approach. As no sequence information of the <italic>L. theobromae</italic> genome is yet available, the project focused on <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. A BLAST search of the <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> genome revealed two sequences with homology to LOX. Sequence as well as phylogenetic analyses indicated that one of those sequences was similar to the previously described 13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX being specific for fungi. Analysis of the second sequence suggested that it may encode a 13<italic>S</italic>-LOX similar to those found in the JA-biosynthetic pathway of plants. Therefore, this sequence was cloned, the protein recombinantly expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified by affinity chromatography, and the purified enzyme was characterized. The enzyme, here named FoxLOX, was found to act as a regular 13-LOX when 18&#x02236;2(n-6) was used as the substrate, however, surprisingly the JA precursor 18&#x02236;3(n-3) was metabolized both by dioxygenase and hydroperoxidase activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>All chemicals used in this study were either from Sigma-Aldrich or from Carl Roth &#x00026; Co.

Several determinants responsible for the regio- and stereo specific dioxygenation reaction in mammalian and plant LOXes can also be identified in FoxLOX. In the following we will briefly highlight the underlying concepts explaining the molecular basis for regio- and stereo specificity and indicate the respective residues in FoxLOX: (i) In case of mammalian LOXes numerous studies established that regiospecificity is mainly determined by three amino acids forming the bottom of the active site and are thus determining the depth of substrate penetration (&#x0201c;triad concept&#x0201d;) <xref rid="pone.0064919-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The positions had been first described by Sloane (Sl) and Borngr&#x000e4;ber (Bo) <xref rid="pone.0064919-Borngrber1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Sloane1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. These three analogous positions are occupied by space filling amino acids in FoxLOX: Trp-400 (indicated as Bo<sup>1</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g002">Figure 2</xref>), Phe-466 (indicated as Sl in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and Leu-657 (indicated as Bo<sup>2</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g002">Figure 2</xref>). (ii) In plants, on the other hand positional specificity has been suggested to be mainly determined by the orientation of the fatty acid within the active site <xref rid="pone.0064919-Andreou2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Andreou4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. According to this model, 13-lipoxygenation occurs when the substrate enters the active pocket with its methyl end first. In analogy to the triad concept derived from mammalian LOXes, the penetration depth of this binding mode is determined by the same space filling residues described by Sloane and Borngr&#x000e4;ber <xref rid="pone.0064919-Borngrber1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Sloane1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Then again, an inverse substrate orientation has been proposed for 9-lipoxygenation, according to which the substrate enters the active site with its carboxy-terminus first <xref rid="pone.0064919-Andreou4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The negative charge of the carboxy terminus is then stabilized by a positively charged Arg residue, which in 13-LOXes is masked by bulky amino acids in the active site <xref rid="pone.0064919-Hornung2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In case of FoxLOX this Arg is substituted by an also positively charged Lys (Lys-612 indicated as Ho) and a Phe residue (Phe-466 indicated as Sl) is positioned at the site of the &#x0201c;Sloane&#x0201d;-determinant which might shield the Lys as it has been observed in plant LOXes <xref rid="pone.0064919-Hornung2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. (iii) The stereo specificity of different LOXes is determined by a single Gly/Ala pair (&#x0201c;Coffa&#x0201d;-site) <xref rid="pone.0064919-Coffa1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> that functions as a switch for &#x0201c;<italic>R</italic>&#x0201d;- and &#x0201c;<italic>S</italic>&#x0201d; selectivity <xref rid="pone.0064919-Coffa2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

The fact that a fungus is able to produce plant-specific signaling molecules led to the concept that these metabolites may interfere with those of the host in order to manipulate its defense reactions <xref rid="pone.0064919-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Tsitsigiannis1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However, in contrast to the well studied JA biosynthetic pathway in plants, that operating in fungi is still elusive. A recent study on this topic demonstrated that in the fungus <italic>L. theobromae</italic> JA is derived from a fatty acid precursor and is formed via the intermediary formation of a cyclopentenone suggesting that the fungal pathway might be similar to that of plants <xref rid="pone.0064919-Tsukada1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. On the other hand a subsequent report, which aimed to characterize the dioxygenase putatively involved in this biosynthetic pathway, could not confirm the existence of plant-like JA biosynthetic enzymes in <italic>L. theobromae.</italic> Instead, an unusual 9<italic>R</italic>-dioxygenase that catalyzing the suprafacial oxidation of C<sub>18</sub>-fatty acids to the corresponding 9<italic>R</italic>-hydroperoxy fatty acids was detected <xref rid="pone.0064919-Jernern1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The aim of the present study was to identify lipoxygenase activity needed for biosynthesis of JA in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> by using a reversed genetic approach based on the genome of this fungus. Of the two predicted LOXes from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, the one encoded for by the gene FOXG_04807.2 was chosen. The enzyme "FoxLOX" was cloned from fungal cDNA, heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli,</italic> and purified by affinity chromatography. To the best of our knowledge FoxLOX is the first ascomycete non-heme iron containing LOX that has been cloned and recombinantly expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and enzymatically characterized.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis shows that at least four major clades of LOX may exist in ascomycetes; all being evolutionary distinct from previously characterized LOXes from plants and mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g001">Figure 1</xref>). While the mammalian and plant LOXes were grouped in one major cluster together with the 13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX, FoxLOX interestingly grouped in a second comparatively small cluster of ascomycete LOXes suggesting that there may be remarkable differences not only in the amino acid sequence, but in their enzymatic properties. These differences are on the one hand reflected by the observation that only the C-terminal catalytic domain of FoxLOX is similar to all other known eukaryotic LOXes. No sequence motif that is indicative for a C2-domain, normally found in the N-terminus of LOXes, could be identified in the N-terminal region of FoxLOX. On the other hand the C-terminal region of FoxLOX was found to harbor specific amino acid positions, known to determine the regio- and stereo specific dioxygenation of fatty acids by mammalian and plant LOXes <xref rid="pone.0064919-Andreou2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Based on this analysis, we predicted FoxLOX to be a linoleate 13<italic>S</italic>- and an arachidonate 15<italic>S</italic>-LOX and this could indeed experimentally be confirmed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064919-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Another feature that points to a similarity of FoxLOX to classical LOXes from plants and mammals is the presence of iron in the active site. This finding is interesting since the only ascomycete LOX that has been cloned and recombinantly expressed so far besides FoxLOX, is the manganese-dependent 13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX from <italic>G. graminis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0064919-Oliw3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Two more features of FoxLOX support the observation that this enzyme is more related to plant and mammalian LOXes than to the fungal 13<italic>R</italic>-MnLOX: (i) It catalyzes a classical antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion as it has been found for all iron LOXes described so far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g007">Figure 7</xref>). (ii) Its reaction has a KIE of approx. 15. This value is higher than the semi-classical limit and thus suggests that the hydrogen abstraction occurs as rate limiting step by quantum mechanical tunneling <xref rid="pone.0064919-Knapp1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. It should be mentioned, however, that compared to the much higher values reported for other LOX-forms (KIE &#x0223c; 25&#x02264;80) <xref rid="pone.0064919-Knapp2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064919-Segraves1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, the value of 15 may suggest a slightly different catalytic mechanism, but we did not follow up a detailed investigation of the underlying biophysical factors causing this differences.</p><p>Interestingly, in contrast to other fatty acids incubations of 18&#x02236;3(n-3) with FoxLOX at high substrate concentrations not only led to the formation of a hydroperoxy fatty acid product, but also yielded at least six different additional products which were derived from the further conversion of the hydroperoxy fatty acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Among those we identified the epoxy-alcohol <italic>threo</italic>-12,13-epoxy-11-hydroxy-9,15-octadecadienoic acid and the keto-derivative 13-KOT. The finding that these products were only formed in minor amounts when using moderate 18&#x02236;3(n-3) concentrations might indicate that even under stirring conditions the reaction was easily depleted of dioxygen. Besides the above mentioned products we also observed formation of doubly oxidized fatty acid, i.e. 9,16-DiHOT and 15,16-DiHOT. 9,16-DiH(P)OD has been isolated as products of potato tuber LOX <xref rid="pone.0064919-Grechkin1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and also by two enzymes from cyanobacteria - CspLOX2 from <italic>Cyanothece spec</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0064919-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. For the latter enzyme substrate labeling as well as enzyme-truncation studies suggested that the dihydroxy fatty acid was derived from the 9-hydroperoxy fatty acid by the catalytic activity of the N-terminal AOS domain and that the second hydroxyl group originates from water rather than from molecular oxygen <xref rid="pone.0064919-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Formation of 15,16-DiHOT together with a 1&#x02236;1 ratio of 9,16-DiHOT diastereomers in incubations of 18&#x02236;3(n-3) with FoxLOX suggested a leukotriene-like mechanism involving intermediate formation of 15,16-epoxy-9,11,13-octadecatrienoic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064919-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). It is interesting to note that this epoxytriene has to be much more stable than <italic>e.g.</italic> leukotriene A<sub>4</sub>, since it survived extraction with diethyl ether and was opened into the two diastereomeric 9-methoxy-16-hydroxyoctadecatrienes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064919.s005">Figure S5</xref>) only when stored for longer periods in methanol.</p><fig id="pone-0064919-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0064919.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Conversion of 18&#x02236;3(n-3) by FoxLOX leading to a set of different products.</title><p>The reaction starts with stereo specific abstraction of a specific hydrogen either from the C-11 or C-14 of the fatty acid backbone yielding a carbon centered radical that is delocalized via the &#x003c0;-electron system.

Abstraction of the hydrogen at the C-14 leads analogously to the formation of a delocalized carbon centered radical that can be either trapped at the C-12 (12-LOX activity) or at the C-16 (16-LOX activity) yielding 12-H(P)OTE or 16-H(P)OTE, respectively. The latter product might be further converted to 15,16-EpOT by elimination of a hydrogen from the C-11.

Together with neighboring Leu- and Phe residues this Gly may form a hydrophobic substrate channel which may be in close proximity to the catalytic metal.
