We collected 86 stool samples from AGE cases and 58 samples from food-handlers during the course of the outbreak and these stool samples were tested for 8 bacterial pathogens and 2 viral pathogens (i.e., norovirus and sapovirus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We detected Sapovirus (SaV), group I Norovirus (NoV GI) and group II Norovirus (NoV GII) from the stool samples of AGE cases. Further sequence analyses showed that the AGE outbreak in August was caused mainly by three rarely reported calicivirus novel genotypes: NoV GI.7, NoV GII.17 and SaV GII.3. Control measures implemented focused on the escalation of personal and environmental hygiene, which included the separation of affected and unaffected soldiers, enforcement of rigorous hand-washing and hygiene, raising awareness of food and water safety, and disinfection of communal areas with bleach.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This study identified both NoV and SaV as the causative agents for an AGE outbreak at a Singapore military camp in August 2015. This study is also the first to report SaV as one of the main causative agents, highlighting the importance of caliciviruses as causative agents of AGE outbreaks in the Singapore military. As there are no commercially available vaccines against caliciviruses, strict personal hygiene and proper disinfection of environmental surfaces remain crucial to prevent calicivirus outbreak and transmission.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sapovirus</kwd><kwd>Norovirus</kwd><kwd>Calicivirus</kwd><kwd>Outbreak</kwd><kwd>Military</kwd><kwd>Singapore</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>Capsid</kwd><kwd>Gastroenteritis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Norovirus (NoV) and sapovirus (SaV) are important viral pathogens of human gastroenteritis in the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NoV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5&#x000a0;kb, containing 3 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the nonstructural proteins (ORF1), a capsid protein (VP1, ORF2) and a small capsid protein (VP2, ORF3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is genetically diverse and is sorted into 6 different genogroups (GI - GVI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The commonly detected genogroups responsible for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in human are GI and GII, although GIV has also been associated with AGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. NoV is the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans globally with the NoV GII.4 variant strains causing the most infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is a highly infectious pathogen that can cause relatively severe disease including vomiting and diarrhea with acute onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The incubation period ranges from 24 to 48&#x000a0;h and symptoms usually resolve within 2 or 3&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As such, norovirus outbreaks are very likely to occur in enclosed living quarters such as military camps, hospitals, cruise ships, nursing homes and restaurants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">SaV also belongs to the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family and can cause gastroenteritis in humans and swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Similar to NoV, SaV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.3 to 7.5&#x000a0;kb, and may have two or three ORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form the non-structural proteins and the major capsid protein VP1. ORF2 encodes the minor structural protein VP2. ORF3 encodes a small basic protein of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Based on complete capsid gene (VP1) sequences, SaV strains are divided into five genogroups (GI to GV), of which GI, GII, GIV, and GV are known to infect humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Traditionally, NoV and SaV differed in their epidemiologies and host ranges. While NoV infections are common in all age groups and are responsible for about 80% of all AGE outbreaks, SaV infections on the other hand, are less common and are known to cause disease primarily in children under the age of 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

SaV has also been detected in the military setting where the communal nature of living and training environments, alongside stressors in the field, may place military personnel at higher risk of contracting and transmitting infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">On 31 August 2015, an AGE outbreak occurred at a military camp in Singapore, involving a total of 150 persons.

In the Singapore military, AGE cases are defined as patients with at least three episodes of watery stool and/or two episodes of vomiting within the 24&#x000a0;h prior to reporting sick. These cases should also have no history of recurrent diarrhea, vomiting, nor abdominal pain. A cluster of 10 or more cases meeting these criteria, linked either by space or a common food source, across 24&#x000a0;h constitutes an AGE outbreak.</p><p id="Par16">Epidemiology teams were sent to conduct investigations and implement control measures. Symptom surveys and hygiene inspections were conducted; and water, food, and stool samples were tested. Water samples were obtained from common water sources at food halls and accommodation areas of the affected soldiers. Food samples were obtained from the food halls in the military camp and these were samples of the food consumed by the military personnel 2&#x000a0;days prior to the AGE outbreak. All the food and water samples were sent to an independent laboratory for culture and testing. Stool samples of cases and food handlers were collected and sent to DSO National Laboratories within 24&#x000a0;h after collection for PCR testing. The number of military personnel reporting sick with AGE was monitored daily by the camp clinic. Control measures were focused on the escalation of personal and environmental hygiene, which included the separation of affected and unaffected soldiers, enforcement of rigorous hand-washing and hygiene practices, and disinfection of communal areas with bleach.

These military personnel typically reside in military camp during the working week and return home on weekends if there are no military activities. Primary healthcare for military personnel is provided by clinics within the military camps, which also serve as on-site surveillance for infectious diseases. The epidemiological curve of this AGE outbreak is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. After the surge of AGE cases (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37) on the initial day of outbreak (31 August 2015), the number of new cases for the next two days remained high at <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;29 and <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27 respectively. This is likely due to the spread of the viral pathogens before the implemented control measures can take effect. On day 4 (3 September 2015) of the outbreak, the number of cases decreased to 18, indicating that the implemented control measures are beginning to take effect. On day 5 (4 September 2015), the number cases decreased to 9 and most military personnel returned home for the weekend of 5 and 6 September 2015. Upon their return to the military camp on the 7 September 2015 (Day 8), a higher than average number of 20 AGE cases was further reported. The following day on 8 September 2015 (Day 9), the number of new cases reported was back to baseline at 8 new cases, indicating that the outbreak had been under control.

Through rapid identification of the pathogens involved and prompt enforcement of public health measures to prevent person-to-person spread of the caliciviruses, this outbreak was quickly controlled within 10&#x000a0;days, resulting in an attack rate of approximately 3% which is much lower compared to those of previously reported norovirus AGE outbreaks in military settings which ranged from 8.3% to 15.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Further sequence analyses showed that this outbreak is caused mainly by three rarely-reported calicivirus genotypes: SaV GII.3, NoV GI.7 and NoV GII.17. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report SaV as one of the main causative agents for an AGE outbreak in the Singapore military. The SaV strain associated with this outbreak was genotyped to be SaV GII.3 and clustered with two human isolates detected in Japan. Although SaV GII.3 has not been associated with any AGE outbreaks in the military, it has been detected in non-hospitalized adults with sporadic cases of AGE in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">A study performed by Ueki et al. has observed that there were high sequence identities between the NoVs detected in the AGE patients and the NoVs detected in the water environment (i.e., domestic sewage, river water etc.) in the same area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For the current study, all the detected NoV GI isolates clustered with environmental isolates detected in the stream water in Korea and in the sewage water in China (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As such, this may suggest that the NoV GI strains detected in this AGE outbreak in Singapore might have their origins from the NoV GI strains that were circulating in Korea and China. NoV GIs are not as well-studied as their GII counterparts due to their lower prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A recent study from Canada, however, showed an increase in the prevalence of NoV GI, with GI.6 and GI.7 as predominating strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The United States also reported increased NoV GI prevalence and ranked NoV GI.7 fourth within all AGE outbreaks occurring between 2009 to 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. NoV GI has also been reported to cause outbreaks in Singapore military camps and other military institutions overseas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], highlighting the outbreak potential of NoV GI.</p><p id="Par32">Our sequencing efforts also confirmed that two of the NoV GII positive samples belonged to genotype GII.17 and they are closely related to an emerging NoV GII.17 variant that was prevalent in Japan from December 2014 onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Modeling of the VP1 protein of this variant has shown that it has the potential to cause large-scale AGE outbreaks, presumably by escaping host immunity and improving VP1&#x02019;s capacity to bind to the histo-blood group antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The results of the current study mirrored the global emergence of NoV GII.17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Based on the investigation findings, including case distribution, food, water and stool sample testing, it was postulated that the cause of this AGE outbreak may be due to the simultaneous introduction of new emerging strains of caliciviruses into a vulnerable population living in a communal military setting. The deviation of the NoV strains (i.e., NoV GI.7 and GII.17) from the traditional outbreak-associated GII.4 strain and the introduction of the emerging SaV strain (SaV GII.3) to the military camp may have resulted in the majority of the military personnel being immunologically susceptible to falling ill with AGE. This in turn contributed to the high number of cases during the first few days of the AGE outbreak.</p><p id="Par34">Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine for both NoV and SaV. Although there is a potential NoV vaccine being tested in human clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], efforts of the NoV vaccine development had been focused mainly on the prevention of the traditionally known NoV pandemic strain GII.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The detection of emerging strains of NoV and SaV serves as reminders of the outbreak potential of these genotypes and efforts should be made to evaluate the cross-reactivity of potential norovirus vaccine candidates against these emerging strains of NoV. Efforts should also be invested to develop vaccine against SaV, which in recent years has become an important emerging pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">As there is currently no routine AGE bio-surveillance program in the Singapore military, the prevalence of these strains of emerging caliciviruses among the military personnel with sporadic cases of AGE in the military remains unknown. Future studies will include widening bio-surveillance efforts to cover routine peacetime AGE surveillance so as to establish the baseline prevalence of gastrointestinal pathogens and to better understand the clinical and epidemiological patterns of these newly emerging caliciviruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">This study highlighted the importance of caliciviruses such as NoV and SaV as causative agents of AGE outbreaks in the Singapore military. As there are currently no commercially available vaccines against caliciviruses, strict personal hygiene and proper disinfection of environmental surfaces remain crucial to prevent calicivirus outbreaks and further transmission.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AGE</term><def><p id="Par5">Acute gastroenteritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AR</term><def><p id="Par6">Attack rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NoV</term><def><p id="Par7">Norovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ORF</term><def><p id="Par8">Open reading frame</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAF</term><def><p id="Par9">Singapore Armed Forces</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SaV</term><def><p id="Par10">Sapovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBE</term><def><p id="Par11">Tris-borate-EDTA</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the staff of Clinical Diagnostic Services Laboratory, DSO National Laboratories who did the initial molecular screening of all AGE samples for presence of bacterial and viral pathogens.
