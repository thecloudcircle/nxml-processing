We previously reported that the V protein, one of the three accessory proteins encoded by the P gene, is one of the key determinants of the pathogenesis of NiV in a hamster infection model. Satterfield B.A. <italic>et al</italic>. have also revealed that V protein is required for the pathogenicity of henipavirus in a ferret infection model. However, the complete functions of NiV V have not been clarified. In this study, we identified UBX domain-containing protein 1 (UBXN1), a negative regulator of RIG-I-like receptor signaling, as a host protein that interacts with NiV V. NiV V interacted with the UBX domain of UBXN1 via its proximal zinc-finger motif in the C-terminal domain. NiV V increased the level of UBXN1 protein by suppressing its proteolysis. Furthermore, NiV V suppressed RIG-I and MDA5-dependent interferon signaling by stabilizing UBXN1 and increasing the interaction between MAVS and UBXN1 in addition to directly interrupting the activation of MDA5. Our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism by which the induction of interferon is potentially suppressed by NiV V protein via UBXN1.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic virus which belongs to the genus <italic>Henipavirus</italic> in the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, and was first identified as the pathogen that caused an outbreak of fatal encephalitis in humans in Malaysia and Singapore in 1999<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the severe pathogenesis of henipavirus infections to allow the development of effective treatments.</p><p id="Par3">The genome of NiV is a negative-strand nonsegmented RNA containing six genes encoding structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), glycoprotein (G), and polymerase (L). The P gene encodes three additional accessory proteins: V, W, and C proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The RNA of the P gene is edited to generate the V and W genes, when additional guanines are inserted at the RNA editing site due to the stuttering of the RNA polymerase during mRNA transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, the P, V, and W proteins share a common N-terminal domain, but each has a unique C-terminal domain. The C protein is encoded in an alternative reading frame of the P gene. We have previously reported that the V and C proteins play key roles in the severe pathogenicity of NiV in a hamster infection model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Satterfield B.

Mathieu C. <italic>et al</italic>. have revealed that C protein contributed to the virulence by regulating the early host proinflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Recently, Marsh G.A. <italic>et al</italic>. isolated Ceder virus (CedPV) from Australian bats as a novel member of henipaviruses. CedPV lacked the RNA editing site for the V protein expression, and was attenuated in ferrets and guinea pigs which are susceptible to NiV and Hendra virus (HeV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It also indicates that V protein is a critical for the pathogenesis of henipaviruses.</p><p id="Par4">Previous studies have demonstrated that henipavirus V proteins suppress the host antiviral response by targeting multiple host proteins.

Two protein bands coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type NiV V, but not with &#x00394;CT were detected (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). One of the proteins with a mass of approximately 42.56&#x02009;kDa was identified as UBX domain-containing protein 1 (UBXN1) by a mass-spectrometric analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). To confirm the result of the mass-spectrometric analysis, the same immunoprecipitation assay was followed by western blotting with an anti-myc antibody and an anti-UBXN1 antibody. UBXN1 was detected as the protein binding to wild-type NiV V, but not to &#x00394;CT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The interaction was also verified by the coimmunoprecipitation of NiV V with the endogenous UBXN1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). In HeLa cells, UBXN1 was also coimmunoprecipitated with NiV V, indicating that UBXN1 is a binding partner of NiV V in various cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). To confirm the requirement of the C-terminal zinc-finger domain for the interaction, myc-tagged wild-type NiV V or &#x00394;CT were coexpressed with HA-tagged UBXN1 in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated with either anti-myc antibody or anti-HA antibody. The wild-type NiV V, but not &#x00394;CT, was coimmunoprecipitated with UBXN1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). To confirm their intracellular interaction, an immunofluorescence assay was also performed after NiV V or UBXN1 was expressed in HEK293T cells. As previously reported, NiV V was mainly localized in cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, upper lane)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. UBXN1 was also localized in cytoplasm, and formed spot-like structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, middle lane), which is reportedly attributable to its association with the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The coexpression of both proteins caused the accumulation of UBXN1 in the cytoplasm, and its signal localized strongly with that of the V protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, lower lane). Furthermore, NiV V was co-localized with endogenous UBXN1 in the cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). These results suggest that V protein interacts intracellularly with UBXN1.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Identification of a protein that interacts with NiV V.

To determine the binding domain of NiV V, the C-terminal domain was divided into three subdomains (Domain1&#x02013;3) and vectors expressing various deletion mutants lacking each subdomain of NiV V (Del1&#x02013;6), were generated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). In an immunoprecipitation assay, the binding affinity of NiV V for UBXN1 was detected with Del1 and Del5, but not with Del2, -3, -4, or -6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). The results indicate that Domain1 is critical for the interaction of the two proteins. However, because Del2 did not coimmunoprecipitate with UBXN1, and the binding capacity of Del5 for UBXN1 was as strong as that of wild-type NiV V protein, whereas that of Del1 was much weaker, the intact structure of the proximal zinc-finger motif, including Domain1 and Domain3, must be important for the efficient interaction of the V protein with UBXN1. It has been reported that UBXN1 consists of three characterized domains, a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, a coiled-coil (CC) domain, and a ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To determine the V-binding domain of UBXN1, expression vectors for GST-tagged deletion mutants of UBXN1 were generated: GST-CC, -UBA, -UBX, -&#x00394;UBX, and -&#x00394;CC, (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). In a GST pull-down assay, the V protein was pulled down by two mutants of UBXN1, GST-UBX and -&#x00394;CC, both of which contained the UBX domain, but not by the other mutants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). This result suggests that NiV V interacts with the UBX domain of UBXN1.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Identification of the binding domains of NiV V and UBXN1.

The expression of UBXN1 protein increased, depending on the amount of the NiV V expression vector transfected, but not for NiV P (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was not affected by the NiV V expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), indicating that NiV V specifically increased the expression of UBXN1. To examine the possibility that a high quantity of UBXN1 results in the increase of its expression amount, we generated the HEK293 cell lines whose UBXN1 gene was knocked-out by a genome editing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). As previously reported, the induction of IFN&#x003b2; was increased by the depletion of UBXN1 in both cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5A,B</xref>). We found that NiV V increased the expression amount of UBXN1 in 293T<sup>UBXN1&#x02212;</sup> cells, indicating that the effects of NiV V on the UBXN1 expression is not due to the artifacts derived from a high quantity of UBXN1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Furthermore, this functional effect of NiV V was also observed in various cell types including Huh-7 and HeLa cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Since the mRNA levels of UBXN1 were not affected by NiV V (data not shown), we speculated that NiV V blocks the degradation of UBXN1.

When NiV V was expressed together with UBXN1, the degradation of UBXN1 was inhibited (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E,F</xref>).

To evaluate the amino-acid requirements for these two functions, we generated vectors expressing various myc-tagged alanine-substitution mutants of NiV V, RRE, ISI, CWD, GKR, AWV, and EEW (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). The mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells and an immunoprecipitation assay was performed. Mutants RRE and EEW maintained the interaction with UBXN1, although it was weaker than that of intact NiV V. However, the interactions of mutants ISI, CWD, GKR, and AWV were eliminated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). To confirm the stabilization of UBXN1 by the myc-tagged alanine-substitution mutants of NiV V, these mutants were coexpressed with HA-tagged UBXN1. RRE stabilized UBXN1 as effectively as did wild-type NiV V, but GKR and EEW stabilized it less effectively, and ISI, CWD, and AWV did not stabilize it at all (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Therefore, residues ISI, CWD, and AWV are important for UBXN1 stabilization. To determine the amino acids required for MDA5 interference, the alanine-substitution mutants of NiV V were coexpressed with MDA5 in HEK293T cells, and the induction of IFN was monitored with an IFN&#x003b2; reporter vector. MDA5 induced the activation of the <italic>IFNB</italic> promoter, and wild-type NiV V interrupted MDA5 activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). The alanine-substitution mutants CWD, GKR, and EEW reduced the activity of MDA5 as strongly as did wild-type NiV V, whereas the interference activities of RRE, ISI, and AWV were weaker than that of wild-type NiV V (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). These results suggest that MDA5 and UBXN1 share the amino acid residues in ISI and AWV to interact with NiV V. On the other hand, CWD and GKR contains the amino acid residues specifically critical for the interaction with UBXN1, and RRE contains those for the interaction with MDA5. Since the binding sites to UBXN1 and MDA5 in NiV V were close, we evaluated the competitive binding of these proteins with immunoprecipitation assay. Although the coimmunoprecipitation of UBXN1 and MDA5 was slightly decreased in the competitive binding, both proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with NiV V together (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). These results indicated that the binding sites of NiV V to MDA5 and UBXN1 were close but not identical, and NiV V could interact with both proteins together.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Amino acids in NiV V required for its interaction with UBXN1.

NiV V increases the stability of UBXN1 by blocking its proteolysis, which requires the interacting domains of both proteins. With alanine-substitution mutants, we showed that Domain1 of NiV V contains the amino acids required both for UBXN1 stabilization and MDA5 interference, but they are not identical. Our results showed that UBXN1 increased the suppression activity of NiV V on MDA5 activation, and conferred the suppression activity on RIG-I activation to NiV V. These results potentially suggest a novel molecular mechanism for the suppression of IFN induction, in which NiV V stabilizes the negative regulator of RIG-I-like receptor signaling, UBXN1.</p><p id="Par13">After recognizing viral RNA in the cytosol, RIG-I and MDA5 recruit MAVS via the CARD&#x02013;CARD homotypic interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Wang <italic>et al</italic>. reported that UBXN1 is induced in a late step of viral infection, and negatively regulates RIG-I-like receptor signaling, interacting with the TRAF 3/6-binding site in MAVS through its N-terminal UBA domain as a dominant-negative binder, and thus disrupting MAVS&#x02013;MAVS aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that NiV V interacts with the C-terminal UBX domain of UBXN1 to stabilize it, suggesting that NiV V potentially enhances the negative regulation of RIG-I-like receptor signaling by stabilizing the induced UBXN1 during viral infection. It has been reported that the V proteins of the paramyxoviruses do not interrupt MAVS directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, but we have shown that NiV V could indirectly interrupts MAVS by stabilizing its dominant-negative binding partner UBXN1.

Our results also indicated that NiV V binds to UBX domain in UBXN1, and it has been reported that multiple host&#x02019;s proteins such as BRCA1, Homer2 and p97 also bind to UBX domain in UBXN1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, we speculate that the only small amount of endogenous UBXN1 in the cells interacted with NiV V because it had already bound to other host proteins, which did not allow us to recognize the functional effects of NiV V on endogenous UBXN1. On the other hand, exogenously expressed UBXN1 might efficiently bind to NiV V before it binds to other host&#x02019;s proteins, which allow us to clearly show the functional effects of NiV V. It has been reported that the gene expression of UBXN1 is induced by the infection of RNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which suggests that NiV V potentially interacts with newly synthesized UBXN1 efficiently, and stabilizes it to suppress IFN induction.</p><p id="Par15">It is known that V proteins in paramyxoviruses shares the zinc-finger structure in their C-terminal domains, and interact with common host proteins such as MDA5, LGP2 and STAT proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

We confirmed the ubiquitylation of NiV V, but the expression levels of NiV V were unaffected by increased amounts of exogenous UBXN1 (data not shown), suggesting that the proteolysis of NiV V is not regulated by UBXN1.
