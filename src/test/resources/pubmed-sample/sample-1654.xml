Neurovascular degeneration is a common feature of these pathologies. Our lab has previously reported that the ureahydrolase arginase 2 (A2) is involved in ischemic retinopathies. Here, we are introducing A2 as a therapeutic target to prevent neurovascular injury after retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insult. Studies were performed with mice lacking both copies of A2 (A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and wild-type (WT) controls (C57BL6J). I/R insult was conducted on the right eye and the left eye was used as control. Retinas were collected for analysis at different times (3&#x02009;h&#x02013;4 week after injury). Neuronal and microvascular degeneration were evaluated using NeuN staining and vascular digests, respectively. Glial activation was evaluated by glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. Necrotic cell death was studied by propidium iodide labeling and western blot for RIP-3. Arginase expression was determined by western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. Retinal function was determined by electroretinography (ERG). A2 mRNA and protein levels were increased in WT I/R. A2 deletion significantly reduced ganglion cell loss and microvascular degeneration and preserved retinal morphology after I/R. Glial activation, reactive oxygen species formation and cell death by necroptosis were significantly reduced by A2 deletion. ERG showed improved positive scotopic threshold response with A2 deletion. This study shows for the first time that neurovascular injury after retinal I/R is mediated through increased expression of A2. Deletion of A2 was found to be beneficial in reducing neurovascular degeneration after I/R.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Retinal ischemia is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness and is involved in various disorders including diabetic retinopathy, acute glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity.

In order to examine this hypothesis, we used quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses to examine arginase expression after I/R or sham injury. These studies showed A2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased within 3&#x02009;h after I/R as compared with the sham control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and c</xref>). In contrast, levels of A1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and protein (data not shown) were slightly reduced at this time.</p><p>Along with others, we have shown that I/R injury results in a marked distortion and thinning of the neural retina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> To assess the role of A2 in this I/R-induced tissue damage, we determined the impact of A2 deletion on retinal morphology at 7 days after I/R injury. Quantitative analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E)-stained retinal sections using ImageJ (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) confirmed a significant thinning of the wild-type (WT) I/R retinas as compared with sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, A2 deletion preserved retinal morphology and prevented retinal thinning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and b</xref>). As the INL is highly sensitive to I/R injury, we also measured INL thickness in response to I/R injury. This analysis showed a 19&#x00025; decrease in INL thickness in WT I/R retinas compared with sham controls, whereas INL thickness in A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R retinas was comparable to both sham control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These data suggest that the I/R-induced increase in A2 expression is critically involved in mediating I/R-induced retinal injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction in retinal cell death and improved neuronal survival by A2 deletion</title><p>The improvement in retinal morphology in the A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R mice suggested that A2 has a critical role in retinal injury during I/R. Previous studies in a rat model of I/R injury have shown that retinal neurons die by necroptosis, a caspase-independent mechanism of programmed cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> In this study, we examined the impact of A2 deletion on I/R-induced necroptosis by evaluating uptake of propidium iodide (PI) after I/R injury. Plasma membrane permeability is an early feature of necroptosis. PI is membrane impermeable in living cells, but when the plasma membrane is permeable it can enter the cell to bind to DNA. We observed a significant increase in PI-positive cells in WT retinas within 6&#x02009;h following I/R injury. PI-labeled cells were mainly localized in GCL and INL of the I/R retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The number of PI-positive cells in the inner retinal layers was significantly reduced with A2 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To further examine the role of necroptosis in I/R-induced injury, we assessed the expression of receptor interacting protein-3 (RIP-3) by western blotting. RIP-3 is a critical regulator of programmed necrosis/necroptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> A significant increase in RIP-3 protein levels was evident at 6&#x02009;h post-injury in WT I/R retinal lysates compared with sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref>). The I/R-induced increase in RIP-3 was largely reduced in A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R retinas. These results suggest that A2 mediates I/R-induced cell death through a mechanism involving necroptosis.</p><p>Degeneration of GCL neurons is another major hallmark of retinal damage following I/R insult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> In order to assess the impact of A2 deletion on I/R-induced loss of GCL neurons, we prepared anti-NeuN immunolabeled retinal flat mounts from I/R treated WT and A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> retinas and their respective sham controls. Consistent with our previous observations, there was a marked decrease in the number of NeuN-positive cells in the GCL layer of WT I/R retina compared to WT sham control at 7 days after I/R injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Quantification using confocal imaging and ImageJ analysis showed a 40&#x00025; decrease in GCL neurons in WT I/R retina compared with control. Deletion of A2 significantly blunted this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The relative density of surviving GCL neurons in the A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R retina was not significantly different from that in the sham control retinas.</p></sec><sec><title>Protection of the retinal microvasculature from I/R injury by A2 deletion</title><p>In addition to the neuronal injury, I/R also induces degeneration of the retinal microvasculature. It has been reported that vascular cells start to die within 2 days after retinal I/R injury with maximum losses at 14 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The vascular cell death leads to the formation of empty basement sleeves, which are termed acellular capillaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Our previous study has shown that A2 deletion significantly reduced retinal vascular injury in the OIR mouse model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Based on these findings, we investigated the impact of A2 deletion on the formation of acellular capillaries after retinal I/R injury. We prepared vascular digests and quantified the number of acellular capillaries in bright field images using ImageJ software. This analysis showed a profound increase in the number of acellular capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) in WT I/R retinas 14 days after I/R insult compared to their respective sham controls. The mean number of acellular capillaries in WT I/R vasculature is 148/mm<sup>2</sup> and 13/mm<sup>2</sup> in sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Deletion of A2 significantly reduced the formation of acellular capillaries in I/R retina (35/mm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction of glial activation and oxidative stress by A2 deletion</title><p>To further assess the effect of A2 deletion on I/R-induced retinal injury we examined glial cell activation by analyzing expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). GFAP is normally expressed in astrocytes and its upregulation is linked to retinal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> M&#x000fc;ller cells show increased GFAP expression under conditions of retinal injury and stress. We assessed GFAP expression by immunofluorescence and western blotting studies 5 days after injury. Immunolocalization analysis showed increased GFAP expression in astrocytes and M&#x000fc;ller cells in WT I/R retinas compared with sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). GFAP was markedly increased in M&#x000fc;ller cells indicating their activation in response to I/R injury. GFAP expression in the A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> retinas was largely unaffected by I/R injury. Western blot analysis further confirmed the immunolabeling results. GFAP levels were significantly increased in WT I/R retinas compared with sham controls. GFAP expression in the A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R retinas was markedly reduced as compared with WT I/R retinas and was similar to that in the sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6b and c</xref>). These data suggest that A2 deletion protected against glial cell activation and limited the cell stress response following retinal I/R injury.</p><p>Oxidative stress is another key mediator of I/R-induced retinal neurovascular injury. In order to assess the involvement of A2 in I/R-induced oxidative stress, we determined the effects of A2 deletion on the formation of superoxide and peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). We used dihydroethidium (DHE) imaging of fresh frozen retinal sections to assess superoxide formation. When superoxide is produced it binds to DHE and oxidizes it to ethidium, which binds to DNA and fluoresces red. We have previously shown that 6&#x02009;h after I/R injury there is a significant increase in superoxide formation in WT retinas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> This was confirmed in our present study. Quantification of DHE assay images using fluorescence microscopy and Metamorph imaging system analysis showed that the I/R injury induced a significant increase in superoxide formation in the WT retinas and that this increase was largely prevented in the A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7a and b</xref>). As DHE can be oxidized by other reactive oxygen species (ROS) in addition to superoxide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> we performed control studies using superoxide dismutase (SOD) to demonstrate specificity of the DHE reaction for superoxide.</p><p>Another marker of oxidative stress is ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> is a short-lived molecule at physiological pH, but it has been shown to nitrate protein tyrosine residues and thus can serve as a ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> biomarker. We have previously shown that nitrotyrosine formation is significantly increased 6&#x02009;h after I/R injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Therefore, we examined ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> formation indirectly by western blotting analysis with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. A significant reduction in the level of nitrated proteins was observed in A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R retina compared with WT I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7c and d</xref>). These findings further support the involvement of A2 in I/R injury-induced oxidative stress.</p><p>The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is one of the mitogen-activated protein kinases that is activated in response to cell stress. Phosphorylation of p38 is an indicator of its activation. We used western blotting to assess p38 phosphorylation in samples collected 3&#x02009;h after injury and observed a significant increase in phospho-p38 in WT I/R retinal lysates compared with sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7e and f</xref>). Phosphorylation of p38 was significantly reduced in A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R retinas compared with WT I/R retinas.</p></sec><sec><title>Protection against I/R-induced impairment of retinal function by A2 deletion</title><p>To assess the effect of A2 deletion on function of the inner retina, we used dark-adapted (scotopic) electroretinography (ERG) to record the positive scotopic threshold response (pSTR). The pSTR is thought to reflect activity of the proximal retinal portion, that is, amacrine and ganglion cells, of the sensitive rod circuit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> This analysis showed that the amplitude of the pSTR was significantly reduced in WT I/R mice compared with WT sham 4 weeks after the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This I/R-induced impairment of the pSTR was significantly lessened in the A2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> I/R retinas at higher intensity stimulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that A2 enzyme is crucially involved in I/R-induced neurovascular degeneration. We show that deletion of A2 gene preserved retinal morphology, improved neuronal survival and decreased the formation of acellular capillaries while reducing oxidative stress, gliosis, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and necroptosis-mediated cell death following I/R injury. These protective effects were associated with an improvement in function of the inner retinal neurons as shown by ERG analysis.</p><p>Our previous studies in the mouse model of I/R injury have shown that expression and activity of NOX2 NADPH oxidase are involved in the neuronal cell death. We found that NOX2 deletion reduced I/R-induced increases in oxidative stress, gliosis and activation of cell stress pathways and protected against neuronal loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Interestingly, western blot analyses of retinal protein samples from the same animals showed that levels of the A2 protein were increased in the WT retina after I/R injury. This increase was completely prevented by deletion of NOX2, suggesting that A2 is a downstream target of NOX2-induced increases in oxidative stress (unpublished data, H Yokota and RB Caldwell). The mechanism by which NOX2 activation increases expression of A2 is unclear. However, we believe that superoxide produced from activated NOX2 along with other ROS, which are markedly increased after I/R has an important role in A2 upregulation that leads eventually to cell death and I/R-induced neurovascular degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Relatively little is known about regulation of A2 expression. However, previous studies have shown that oxidative species can increase A1 expression in vascular endothelial cells through protein kinase C-mediated activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Studies using mesenteric arteries from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats have shown a link between increased formation of phospho-p38 MAPK, increased expression of A1 and A2 and vascular dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> These effects were reversed by p38 MAPK inhibition.

Although the role of arginase in retinal I/R injury has not been studied until now, our previous studies have shown that both arginase isoforms are expressed in the retina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> We also have found that streptozotocin-induced diabetes causes an increase in retinal arginase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> and that inhibition of arginase activity or deletion of one copy of A1 and both copies of A2 reduces diabetes-induced retinal inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, our studies in a mouse model of OIR have shown that homozygous deletion of A2 prevents hyperoxia-induced neuronal-glial injury and improves retinal function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Studies in the same model showed that A2 deletion also prevents oxidative stress and limits retinal vascular degeneration and pathological neovascularization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> We have shown that A2 is highly expressed in the horizontal cells and in the ONL in OIR model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> A2-induced cell death in other retinal layers could be mediated through signals initiated by cell&#x02013;cell interactions or release of soluble cytotoxic factors from activated cell types such as micro- or macro-glia.

We show that deletion of A2 significantly reduced the I/R-induced increases in superoxide and nitrotyrosine formation. Taken together with our finding that deletion of NOX2 limits I/R injury induced increases in A2 expression, the latter result suggests that NOX2-induced increases in oxidative stress are due in part to the upregulation of A2. It should be noted that there is a difference in relative intensity of the DHE reaction in the INL and GCL, which is consistent with the patterns of PI labeling in these layers. In contrast, the lack of PI labeling in the ONL in combination with the intense DHE reaction suggests that the photoreceptors are dying at a different time and/or are less sensitive to oxidative injury than the INL and GCL neurons.</p><p>Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which A2 increases oxidative stress. However, our investigations in models of OIR and diabetic retinopathy suggest that increases in superoxide and ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> formation subsequent to arginase-induced depletion of the <sc>l</sc>-arginine supply to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) may be involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Our studies in the OIR model have also identified a downstream element in the arginase pathway, altered polyamine metabolism by spermine oxidase (SMO), as a source of oxidative stress and damage to retinal neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Oxidation of spermine by SMO has been shown to lead to production of hydrogen peroxide and the reactive aldehyde 3-amino propanal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Both can damage DNA, RNA, proteins and membranes. Our studies in the OIR model have shown that hyperoxia-induced neuronal cell death is associated with increase in SMO expression along with elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide formation and that treatment with a SMO inhibitor reduced oxidative stress and decreased neuronal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> It is possible that the neurovascular protection from I/R injury provided by A2 deletion is mediated via disruption of the polyamine oxidase signaling pathway. This will be investigated in our future studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Activation of M&#x000fc;ller glial cells, characterized by increased GFAP expression, is a well-established injury marker in retinal disease conditions such as I/R, diabetic retinopathy and OIR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> This was confirmed in our study. Further, the I/R-induced activation of Muller cells was prevented by A2 deletion, demonstrating a protective effect of A2 deletion on glia. This is consistent with our previous observation that A2 deletion abrogates glial activation in the OIR model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Death of neurons in the inner retina following I/R can occur through different mechanisms including apoptosis, necrosis and programmed necrosis, that is, necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> In this study, PI labeling showed a significant increase in PI-positive cells in the inner retina at 6&#x02009;h after I/R. The number of PI-positive cells was significantly reduced in the retinas of A2 deficient mice. PI staining showed a reduced signal in the GCL compared with the INL in WT retinas. However, NeuN labeling showed a severe loss of GCL neurons. This could mean that GCL neurons are dying by other mechanism and/or at different time points. PI labeling was done 6&#x02009;h after I/R, but neurodegeneration was assessed 7 days after I/R. It should be noted that while PI labels cells dying by necroptosis, it also stains late apoptotic and early necrotic cells. Thus, we examined expression of RIP-3, a marker for necroptotic cell death. Previous studies have reported that RIP-3 expression is rapidly increased in cells of the GCL and INL in the rat retina following acute increases in intraocular pressure (IOP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> It was also reported that RIP-3 immunolabeling was colocalized with the PI-positive cells in the GCL that indicates the involvement of RIP-3 in necroptotic cell death. Our western blotting analysis showed a significant increase in RIP-3 protein expression following I/R, which was significantly reduced in A2-deficient retinas. These results indicate that A2 is involved in the I/R-induced necroptosis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that A2 is crucially involved in I/R-induced retinal neurovascular injury, through a mechanism involving increased oxidative stress, glial activation and necroptotic cell death. Our study suggests that A2 can be considered as a therapeutic target to decrease neurovascular degeneration after I/R injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and I/R insult</title><p>All procedures with animals were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (Animal Welfare Assurance no.
