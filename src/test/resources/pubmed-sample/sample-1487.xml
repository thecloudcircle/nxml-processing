To address this problem, the Cochrane Collaboration recommends reviewers to contact authors of eligible primary studies to obtain additional information on poorly reported items. In this protocol, we present a cross-sectional study and a survey to assess (1) how reviewers of new Cochrane intervention reviews report on procedures and outcomes of contacting of authors of primary studies to obtain additional data, (2) how authors reply, and (3) the consequences of these additional data on the outcomes and quality scores in the review. All research questions and methods were pilot tested on 2&#x000a0;months of Cochrane reviews and were subsequently fine-tuned.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods for the cross-sectional study</title><p id="Par2">Eligibility criteria are (1) all new (not-updates) Cochrane intervention reviews published in 2016, (2) reviews that included one or more primary studies, and (3) eligible interventions refer to contacting of authors of the eligible primary studies included in the review to obtain additional research data (e.g., information on unreported or missing data, individual patient data, research methods, and bias issues). Searching for eligible reviews and data extraction will be conducted by two authors independently. The cross-sectional study will primarily focus on how contacting of authors is conducted and reported, how contacted authors reply, and how reviewers report on obtained additional data and their consequences for the review.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods for the survey</title><p id="Par3">The same eligible reviews for the cross-sectional study will also be eligible for the survey. Surveys will be sent to the contact addresses of these reviews according to a pre-defined protocol. We will use Google Forms as our survey platform. Surveyees are asked to answer eight questions. The survey will primarily focus on the consequences of contacting authors of eligible primary studies for the risk of bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation scores and the primary and secondary outcomes of the review.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">The findings of this study could help improve methods of contacting authors and reporting of these procedures and their outcomes.

Synthesizing the outcomes of poorly reported studies can pose a serious threat to the validity of systematic reviews and healthcare guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Cochrane Collaboration therefore recommends reviewers to contact authors of eligible studies included in the review and to request additional information on poorly reported items in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In new Cochrane intervention reviews, we will quantify issues such as (1) how reviewers report on procedures and outcomes of contacting authors to obtain additional information, (2) how contacted authors reply, and (3) the consequences of the additional obtained data for the risk of bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and for the primary and secondary outcomes of the review.</p><p id="Par8">Poor reporting does not permit an adequate assessment of how a study was conducted and whether systematic error could have influenced outcomes. Various research papers have assessed these issues and have confirmed that reporting of trial findings is often incomplete and biased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adverse events are also often underreported and can lead to misconceptions on the safety of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Addressing incomplete reporting of primary studies is particularly important for systematic reviews, because reporting issues can influence the conclusions of such studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and could raise serious doubts whether the outcomes of a systematic review can be trusted. This is a problem for a variety of stakeholders including patients, clinicians, researchers, health care policymakers, insurance companies, pertinent healthcare industries, research sponsors, or others.</p><p id="Par9">To systematically tackle inadequate reporting, the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network seeks to improve reporting by promoting the wider use of key reporting standards for a variety of study designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although these guidelines are endorsed by many journals, improvements of reporting in research articles are still small or insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Contacting the original authors of a research study by systematic reviewers to obtain additional research data is another strategy for dealing with incomplete reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Such methods have provided important research data that have permitted systematic reviewers to (1) assess the eligibility of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], (2) assess conflicts of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], (3) obtain research protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], (4) assess the study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], (5) obtain information on groups of participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], (6) obtain outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], (7) calculate missing statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], (8) assess sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], (9) assess information on blinding of participants and personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], (10) fine-tune risk of bias assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and (11) assess the risk of selective outcome reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Contacting of study authors is defined as &#x0201c;Highly desirable&#x0201d; according to the Methodological standards for the conduct of new Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To scrutinize this issue, we will ask a series of questions on contacting of authors in these &#x0201c;MECIR guided&#x0201d; systematic reviews such as (1) how the reviewers report on contacting of authors of eligible studies, (2) the prevalence of reviews that contacted studies, (3) the validity of author contact data, (4) how contacted authors reply, (5) how reviewers report on the obtained additional data, and (6) what the consequences of these additional data are for the risk of bias scores of the eligible primary studies and for the GRADE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] scores and the primary and secondary outcomes of the review. We will also quantify the prevalence of &#x0201c;Unclear&#x0201d; risk of bias scores in the eligible studies in these new Cochrane intervention reviews, because this statistic could be an indicator of the need to contact authors of primary research studies to obtain additional information.</p><p id="Par10">To assess what has been published on these issues, we conducted scoping searches in the following electronic databases: Pubmed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The &#x0201c;Related Articles&#x0201d; feature in PubMed was also used to find additional studies. These procedures identified various publications on contacting of authors, but little has been published on our research questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For example, (1) Two papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] discussed the importance of contacting authors, (2) Schroll et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], Selph et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and Van Driel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] asked different research questions on contacting authors, (3) Wolfe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] did not ask most of our questions, focused exclusively on missing drug trial data, and used different methodology, (4) Young et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] assessed the effects of different methods to obtain additional data, but did not ask our research questions (3), and (5) Mullan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] showed that procedures and outcomes of contacting authors in top medical journals and Cochrane reviews were suboptimal but this study included only a small number of Cochrane reviews (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;54), assessed data of more than 10&#x000a0;years ago, and did not cover most of our research questions. We also conducted a cross-sectional and a survey pilot study in 2&#x000a0;months of Cochrane intervention reviews (July and August 2015), which (1) confirmed the importance of addressing our questions, (2) showed the need to use both a cross-sectional study and a survey to adequately address these questions, and (3) identified at least one &#x0201c;Unclear&#x0201d; risk of bias domain in most of the eligible studies of these reviews. The published evidence on the importance of obtaining additional research information from original investigators, the knowledge gaps in the literature on our research questions, and the outcomes of our pilot tests all demonstrated the need for undertaking this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cross-sectional study</title><p id="Par11">The main objectives for our cross-sectional study are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par12">To calculate the prevalence of reviews that reported that they contacted studies to obtain additional information</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">To calculate the prevalence of reviews that reported the number of all contacted studies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">To calculate the prevalence of reviews that reported that all studies with at least one &#x0201c;Unclear&#x0201d; (as a result of missing or insufficient information) risk of bias score were contacted</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">To calculate the prevalence of reviews that reported the number of all replying studies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">To calculate the prevalence of replying studies among the contacted studies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">To calculate the prevalence of reviews that reported what information data was (were) obtained from each of the replying studies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">To calculate the prevalence of reviews that reported the consequences of each of the obtained information data that was (were) obtained from each of the replying studies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">To calculate the prevalence of eligible primary studies with at least one domain scored as &#x0201c;Unclear&#x0201d; risk of bias</p></list-item></list>

For step 5, we will select eligible systematic reviews in the Cochrane Database. The same selected eligible reviews will be used for both the cross-sectional study and the survey. To avoid the risk of foreknowledge of outcomes, we will complete all data extraction for the cross-sectional study (step 6) prior to conducting the survey (step 7). To avoid bias during data analyses (step 8), we will use Excel files that conceal all reference to the origin of the data, i.e., files without the titles of the reviews and the names and emails of the authors.

The rationale for this &#x0201c;No&#x0201d; score is that such linking could indeed refer to contacting of studies to obtain additional information (e.g., missing data and risk of bias), but could also refer to contacting of authors to assess the eligibility of studies or contacting of authors to identify additional or ongoing studies.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Reporting on contacting of studies with &#x0201c;Unclear&#x0201d; risk of bias domains<sup>a</sup>

<sup>a</sup>Higgins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] divide the definition of &#x0201c;Unclear&#x0201d; risk of bias in three subgroups: Studies are assessed as at unclear risk of bias (1) when too few details are available to make a judgement of &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; risk; (2) when the risk of bias is genuinely unknown despite sufficient information about the conduct; or (3) when an entry is not relevant to a study (for example because the study did not address any of the outcomes in the group of outcomes to which the entry applies).

For this statistic, the following calculation is made: the number of reviews that reported that they contacted studies to obtain additional information/the total number of eligible reviews. To calculate the required sample size, we conducted a power calculation using software developed by EpiTools epidemiological calculators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We first conducted a pilot test on all eligible Cochrane systematic reviews published in July and August 2015 to identify the estimated prevalence for the primary outcome. This pilot study showed that 40 of 52 (76.92%) eligible reviews were contacted to obtain additional information. EpiTools calculated a sample size of 273 for the estimated prevalence of 0.7692 with a 0.95 confidence level (desired precision of estimate 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Since 2&#x000a0;months (July and August 2015) of new Cochrane intervention reviews provided 52 eligible reviews, this would account for 26 reviews per months.

When 12&#x000a0;months of new Cochrane intervention reviews will not provide the required sample size of 273 reviews, we will include subsequent months of eligible reviews, i.e., from January 2017 onwards until the desired sample size will be reached.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Outcome measures and statistical analysis</title><p id="Par83">The planned outcomes for the cross-sectional study and the survey will be presented in summary of findings tables (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

The quality of these reviews strongly depends on the quality of the reporting of the eligible primary studies. Contacting authors of these studies to obtain additional information could be an important research procedure for dealing with suboptimal reporting. This study will explore issues such as (1) how reviewers report on contacting of authors of eligible studies in the review and the outcomes of these procedures, (2) the validity of contact data in contacted studies, (3) how contacted investigators reply, (4) how reviewers report on the obtained additional data, (5) what the consequences of these contacting procedures are for outcomes and quality scores in the review, (6) the differences between outcomes reported in the review with those recorded in the survey, and (7) the prevalence of primary studies with at least one domain scored as &#x0201c;Unclear&#x0201d; risk of bias.</p><p id="Par86">Positive findings are important, because little has been published on these research questions and such outcomes could address some knowledge gaps and could quantify the importance of contacting of authors. However, negative outcomes are expected, because our pilots test showed (1) that procedures of contacting authors and the consequences are underreported in systematic reviews of interventions and (2) that contacted authors of primary studies reply poorly to reviewers. These negative findings could show the need for developing guidelines for reporting and conducting of contacting procedures of primary research studies and their outcomes in systematic reviews. These findings could direct research on this topic and could also show the need to keep contact data of investigators up to date in a central register. Better methods of conducting and reporting of communication between systematic reviewers and authors of primary research studies could lead to a better understanding of what was done in the eligible studies and could ultimate improve the quality and the trustworthiness of the review and its reproducibility. Patients, clinicians, researchers, guideline developers, research sponsors, and the general public will all be beneficiaries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
