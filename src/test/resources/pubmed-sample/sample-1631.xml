Scientists are compelled to find alternatives to currently used fuels because of their decreased purification capacity; pollution caused by fossil fuels, their limited life span, and increased prices. Mono alkyl ester biodiesel is a clean diesel fuel that can be manufactured by fresh or used vegetable oils or even animal fats and waste oils. This fuel is made from renewable sources and is biodegradable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Transesterification method or green process is one way of producing biodiesels. In this method, vegetable oils are added to an alcohol (usually methanol) producing esters. It is noteworthy that glycerol is the byproduct of this reaction which greatly contributes to the pharmaceutical science and cosmetic products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Parameters affecting transesterification procedure are: reaction temperature, alcohol-oil mole proportion, humidity, free fatty acids, mixing speed, alcohol type, reaction duration, catalyst type and amount [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Catalysts used in transesterification procedure are categorized into 3 groups: homogenic catalysts, heterogenic catalysts, and biocatalysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The limitations of homogenic catalysts have resulted in the dominant use of the heterogenic catalysts. Heterogenic catalysts and reactants are in separate phases and are divided into acidic and basic solid catalysts. ZrO and TiO are examples of acidic solid catalysts, while MgO and CaO are among the basic solid ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is worthy to mention that basic solid catalysts happen to be more effective than the acidic ones because they do not require high temperature and pressure, thus react more rapidly, have fewer side reactions, have no oxidation, and are more available and cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Heterogenic catalysts are beneficial in many ways: a) They decrease soaping problems and water usage, b) they do not mix with methanol or ethanol, c) they are easy to separate from biodiesel and glycerol, d) they are recyclable and can be reused many times, e) they are environmentally compatible and can be used in continuous and non-continuous procedures, f) they have low sensitivity to free fatty acids because of the stability of their surface microcrystal structure, and g) their quality of biodiesel is high, although they convert triglyceride to biodiesel rather slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In fact, the most important problem in producing biodiesel is its high cost which depending on the primal raw material can be 1.5 times the prices of petroleum diesel. Reports? almost 80&#x000a0;% of the total biodiesel cost comes from primal materials cost which are vegetable oils or animal fats. Thus, using burnt food oil decreases the related costs in producing biodiesel because of its availability and inexpensiveness. In addition, environmental pollution is lessened by recycling used cooking oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Used cooking oils have characteristics that make them different rather than vegetable oils or animal fats. High cooking temperature and food water hydrolyze triglycerides produce lots of free fatty acids. Reaction between these free fatty acids and water can form soaps and reduce biodiesel efficacy. Free fatty acids make up 0.5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;% of used cooking oil weight, although the proper amount for transesterification reaction is less than 0.5&#x000a0;% of weight percentage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Basic heterogenic catalysts are divided into metallic oxides and their derivatives. CaO is one type of basic heterogenic catalysts which is most widely used for transesterification reaction because it is highly basic, and has a low solubility in methanol; it can be synthesized from inexpensive sources such as lime stone and calcium hydroxide and generates low bioenvironmental pollution. Nanocatalysts have high specific surface and degeneration activity. Other studies have shown that high specific surface and large porosity is beneficial for the catalyst to bond with the sub-layer which enhances the efficacy of transesterification reaction. One way to produce Nano CaO is to saturate lithium on CaO through wet method. It is suggested that a 12:1 proportion of methanol to oil at 65 C heat in 2&#x000a0;h using 5&#x000a0;% weight of the catalyst for esterification of jatropha oil has a yield over 99&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The first basic heterogenic catalyst in pilot scale used for transesterification reaction was MgO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other studies have indicated that MgO has a fine efficacy in non-continuous reactions. Production costs of biodiesel products in a discontinuous reactor decrease in the presence of MgO. MgO has a high yield in highly critical conditions and in a high proportion of methanol to oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The following results are achieved in other studies concerning MgO catalyst (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The efficacy of methyl ester using MgO as catalyst</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Type of Oil</th><th>Surface Area (M<sup>2</sup>/g)</th><th>Reaction&#x02019;s Temperature (<sup>o</sup> C)</th><th>Molar ratio Methanol/oil</th><th>Reaction&#x02019;s Duration (hour)</th><th>Catalyst concentration (% W/W)</th><th>Efficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Linseed Oil</td><td>300</td><td>Methanol-Reflux</td><td>75:1</td><td>22</td><td>10&#x000a0;%</td><td>64&#x000a0;%</td></tr><tr><td>Soybean Oil</td><td>36</td><td>180</td><td>12:1</td><td>1</td><td>5&#x000a0;%</td><td>72&#x000a0;%</td></tr><tr><td>Soybean Oil</td><td>229</td><td>180</td><td>12:1</td><td>1</td><td>5&#x000a0;%</td><td>90&#x000a0;%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Nano MgO exhibits a high yield for soy oil transesterification reaction in the presence of super critical methanol. This catalyst&#x02019;s solubility and penetration plays an essential role in enhancing the reaction efficacy, which also can be adjusted by mixing two catalysts. For instance, 90&#x000a0;% yield is achieved by soy oil in a 10-min reaction, using 36:1 methanol to oil ratio, 533&#x000a0;K temperature, 3&#x000a0;% weight catalyst, and 1000&#x000a0;rpm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Another tranesterification reaction was performed on cotton seed oil, in the presence of 14.4&#x000a0;% weight CaO-MgO catalyst, loaded on Al2O3, using 12:24 methanol to oil ratio, 95.63&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C temperature, and 97.62&#x000a0;% yield was achieved. Two types of commercial nanopowder calcium oxides were studied in order to discuss the transesterification reaction of canola oil: Nanopowder exhibiting a higher surface area (HSA nano-CaO) and nanopowder exhibiting a moderate surface area (nano-CaO). The effects of reaction temperature, catalyst/oil weight ratio, and methanol/oil molar ratio on the reaction&#x02019;s conditions were studied. The results claim that nanopowder CaOs present a higher activity than the other type, due to their larger BET surface areas. At 65&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 99.85&#x000a0;% biodiesel yield was obtained by 3 wt. % of the nano-CaO catalyst, and 9:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, in 2&#x000a0;h. The required catalyst/oil weight ratio in order to achieve the same yield under the same conditions, was 10 times less in the HSA-nano-CaO catalyst&#x02019;s case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, Nano CaO and Nano MgO were synthesized, using sedimentation method and sol-gel self-combustion, respectively. While the next step was progressing, transesterification reaction was performed and examined in different ways with various proportions of catalyst weight and mole proportion of alcohol to oil. Also, catalyst repeatability was assessed. This study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of the reaction with and without catalysts by coupling Nano CaO and Nano MgO. Using a combination of 2 catalysts (MgO and CaO) results in an enhanced basic strength and contact surface. Subsequently, the reaction is performed more gently and is more repeatable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Analytical reagent (AR) grade calcium nitrate, ammonia, urea, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, methanol, 2-propanol, and phenolphthalein were purchased from Merck.

Two grams of NaOH was dissolved in 25&#x000a0;ml of purified water, added drop by drop, as the mixing took place. The produced mixture was mixed for 2&#x000a0;h so that a clear white gel was obtained. The white gel was kept still for 2&#x000a0;h for the reaction to complete. Then after 4 times of being washed with water, NaOH was excreted and pH was adjusted at about 10. After that, the gel was heated up to 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;h so that the water could be vaporized and the gel concentrated. The concentrated gel was placed in a desiccator for one hour to dry completely. The resulting dry gel was milled in the form of a white powder.

As water vaporized, the solution was concentrated and became viscose. The resulting gel underwent self-combustion; as a result, it started boiling and surfaced the walls of the crucible. Subsequently, a thermo genic reaction took place and a lateritious gas was emitted. This reaction left a white porous mass. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions in the compound created an oxidative environment for the degradation of organic mixtures. In order to eliminate the remaining organic material, the powder from self-combustion reaction must be de-carbonized at higher temperatures.

This reaction results in meth oxide anion formation. Meth oxide group holds an oxygen molecule within its structure which attacks carbon from triglyceride-fatty acid&#x02018;s carbonyl group, resulting in alkoxycarbonyl formation as an intermediate structure. Alkoxycarbonyl transfroms itself into more stable products: fatty acid methyl ester and diglyceride. As the transformation continues, diglyceride converts to monoglyceride and fatty acid methyl ester. During the third step, monoglyceride undergoes the same reaction and produces glycerin and fatty acid methyl ester. In conclusion, fatty acid tri-methyl ester and glycerin are the final products of the reaction.

Nano MgO is not capable of catalyzing the transesterification by itself, because it has a much weaker basic affinity but when used with Nano CaO due to its surface structure, the basic properties increase and it becomes a proper base for the catalyst so that CaO contact surface increases and transesterification reaction yield significantly increases as well. Needless to say that higher proportions of Nano CaO to Nano MgO lead to increase in biodiesel production mass yield. The optimum condition for this catalyst is 1:7 methanol to oil (the same ratio which is applied for Nano CaO), 6&#x000a0;h and 0.7&#x000a0;g of Nano CaO plus 0.5&#x000a0;g of Nano MgO which gives the yield of 98.95&#x000a0;% of weight. Moreover, combined catalyst repeatability is better than Nano CaO alone. In addition, using waste cooking oil is more cost-effective.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors' contributions</bold></p><p>KT have designed of the study and participated in its Conception, data analysis and interpretation, Obtained funding, and final approval of the article.
