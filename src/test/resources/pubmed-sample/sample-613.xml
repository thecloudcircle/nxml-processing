Ingesting high fatty meals increases LPS that cause metabolic endotoxemia. Subclinical LPS in periodontal disease may impair endothelial function. The heart may be targeted as cardiac cells express TLR4, the LPS receptor. It was hypothesized that recurrent exposure to subclinical LPS increases mortality and causes cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>C57Bl/6 mice were injected with intraperitoneal saline (control), low dose LPS (0.1 or 1 mg/kg), or moderate dose LPS (10 or 20 mg/kg), once a week for 3 months. Left ventricular (LV) function (echocardiography), hemodynamics (tail cuff pressure) and electrocardiograms (telemetry) were measured. Cardiac fibrosis was assessed by picrosirius red staining and LV expression of fibrosis related genes (QRT-PCR). Adult cardiac fibroblasts were isolated and exposed to LPS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>LPS injections transiently increased heart rate and blood pressure (&#x0003c;6 hours) and mildly decreased LV function with full recovery by 24 hours. Mice tolerated weekly LPS for 2&#x02013;3 months with no change in activity, appearance, appetite, weight, blood pressure, LV function, oximetry, or blood chemistries. Mortality increased after 60&#x02013;90 days with moderate, but not low dose LPS. Arrhythmias occurred a few hours before death. LV collagen fraction area increased dose-dependently from 3.0&#x000b1;0.5% (SEM) in the saline control group, to 5.6&#x000b1;0.5% with low dose LPS and 9.7&#x000b1;0.9% with moderate dose LPS (P&#x0003c;0.05 moderate vs low dose LPS, and each LPS dose vs control). LPS increased LV expression of collagen I&#x003b1;1, collagen III&#x003b1;1, MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, periostin and IL-6 (P&#x0003c;0.05 moderate vs low dose LPS and vs control).

Activation of the innate immune system in the heart by TLR4 has diverse effects with cardioprotective myocardial effects in the short-term, whereas sustained activation may be maladaptive <xref rid="pone.0061057-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The myocardial effects of recurrent subclinical activation of TLR4 is not known. Studies from this laboratory demonstrated that low levels of LPS activate cardiac myocytes to depress contractility <xref rid="pone.0061057-Yasuda1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and induce apoptosis by activating the cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT<sub>1</sub>-R) <xref rid="pone.0061057-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061057-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since RAS activation may lead to cardiac fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0061057-Mehta1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, it was hypothesized that LPS may induce cardiac fibrosis. Recurrent exposure to subclinical LPS may have cumulative effects to alter left ventricular (LV) structure and function and decrease survival.</p><p>In order to test these hypotheses, a murine model of recurrent exposure to subclinical LPS was developed. Rodents are suitable for a chronic model because they are more resistant to sudden death after acute exposure to LPS compared with other species. Mice were injected with intraperitoneal (i.p.) LPS once a week in doses that caused no distress and with only mild transient effects on LV function and hemodynamics that resolved within 6&#x02013;24 hours. Mice tolerated weekly i.p. LPS for 2&#x02013;3 months with no change in activity, appetite, weight, blood pressure, or blood chemistries. However, LPS induced a dose-dependent cardiac fibrosis and increase in mortality, which are major adverse consequences of this seemingly benign subclinical condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and the &#x0201c;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&#x0201d;, Eighth Edition published in 2011. The studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Research and Development Committee of the VA San Diego Healthcare System. All animals were monitored daily (7 days/week) for any signs of distress, lethargy, labored breathing, anorexia, or refusal to eat or drink. If mice developed any of these symptoms or anorexia with weight loss of more than 1&#x02013;2 gm over 2&#x02013;3 days, mice were euthanized. Mice completing the protocol were euthanized after inducing deep anesthesia with an i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital 50 mg/ml, and after loss of paw withdrawal, opening the chest and excising the heart by surgical dissection to induce death by exsanguination.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental Protocol</title><p>All studies were performed in male C57Bl/6 mice, greater than 2 months in age (25&#x02013;30 gm) from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were injected i.p. with LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 055, LPS no. B5, List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) in doses of 0.1, 1.0, 10 or 20 mg/kg (volume diluted with saline in 0.5 ml). Mice were injected with 0.5 ml of saline as a control.</p><p>Echocardiography was performed with a Sonos 5500 (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA) with a L15&#x02013;6 MHz linear transducer. Acute changes in LV function were assessed at baseline (time&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0), 6, or 24 hours after i.p. injection of LPS or saline. Chronic effects were evaluated after two and three months of weekly i.p. injections of LPS or saline. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane 5% in 100% oxygen for one minute, and then maintained with 1% isoflurane in 100% oxygen by face mask at 1 L/minute flow rate. Standard M-mode images were recorded at the level of the papillary muscles with parasternal short-axis views. Three consecutive cardiac cycles were averaged to measure LV internal diameter at end-diastole and end-systole, fractional shortening (% change in LV diameter from end-diastole to end-systole), LV wall thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall at end-diastole and end-systole, percent wall thickening (from end-diastole to end-systole), and indices of LV contractility with aortic ejection time and velocity of circumferential shortening.</p><p>Mice were instrumented for telemetry to continuously record the ECG and measure heart rates. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) to implant a radio transmitter (EA-F20, Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN) into the peritoneal cavity with wires tunneled subcutaneously and sutured over the right thorax and left lower abdomen to simulate an ECG lead II <xref rid="pone.0061057-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Mice were allowed to recover for at least one week before receiving injections. Transmissions from the telemetry units continuously recorded the ECG, activity and body temperature on a PC using Dataquest A.R.T. software (Data Sciences International). ECG signals were sampled at 2000 Hz. Mean heart rate (moving average over 10 seconds) was recorded for 1 hour before and 8 to 24 hours after injections.</p><p>Blood pressure was measured in conscious mice trained to lie quietly in a restraining cage. A tail-cuff was placed to occlude blood flow and a volume pressure sensor probe placed distally to measure systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure and heart rate using the Coda&#x02122; Non-Invasive Blood Pressure System (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT).</p><p>The effects of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>-R) blockade was examined in mice with losartan added to the drinking water, beginning three days prior to injections and continued throughout the protocol. Weights and average daily water consumption were recorded for each mouse to adjust drug concentrations in the water for a dose of losartan at 20 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Cutaneous pulse oximetry was measured with a MouseOx Pulse Oximeter from Starr Life Sciences (Oakmont, PA), with MouseOx software to record oxygen saturation. Blood was collected at the time of sacrifice for a complete blood count and blood chemistry, performed by the Animal Care Program UCSD Diagnostic Laboratory.</p><p>Picosirius red staining was performed on short axis midwall LV rings that had been formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded. De-waxed sections (6 &#x000b5;m) were rehydrated, stained with picrosirius red (1 h). LV sections were then dehydrated using graded concentrations of ethanol and mounted in Permont. Fractional area of fibrosis was quantified using NIH image software ImageJ. LV sections were immunostained with antibodies to &#x003b1;-SMA and Ki67 to identify myofibroblasts and proliferating fibroblasts as previously described <xref rid="pone.0061057-Dobaczewski1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was used to measure expression of fibrosis, inflammatory cytokines, and hypertrophy related genes. Total RNA was extracted from LV samples, digested with RNase-free DNase, and reverse transcribed. QRT-PCR was performed and RNA equivalents normalized to simultaneously determine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels in each sample.</p><p>Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from adult mouse hearts using a Langendorf apparatus and digested with collagenase solution as previously described <xref rid="pone.0061057-Haudek1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Fibroblasts from 2 hearts were combined, plated in media, and grown to 90&#x02013;100% confluence and studied within two passages. Fibroblasts were starved and treated with 0.5% irradiated, low endotoxin FBS and exposed to 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 ng/ml LPS for 48 hours.</p><p>Statistical analyses for comparing multiple groups were performed with SigmaPlot 11 for one way and two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multiple comparisons between two or more groups were made using the Holm-Sidak Test. A mixed model analysis was performed with SPSS v.13 to evaluate blood pressure and heart rates at baseline, and their response 24 hours after injections, and temporal trends over three time periods during the protocol. A log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed to evaluate Kaplan-Meier curves to detect differences in survival using GraphPad Prism v. 5. A Gehan-Breslow Wilcox test was used to detect differences between individual survival curves, using a Bonferroni method to correct for multiple comparisons. In all cases, differences were considered significant at P&#x0003c;0.05, with additional tests used for post-hoc analyses as noted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Murine model of recurrent subclinical LPS exposure</title><p>Mice were injected with i.p. saline or LPS (0.1, 1.0, 10 or 20 mg/kg) with no signs of distress or anxiety.

Weekly exposure to LPS in doses with mild, transient effects that resolved within hours, increased mortality after 2&#x02013;3 months. Deaths occurred unexpectedly, as mice appeared with normal activity, appetite, weight, hemodynamics, and with normal measures of LV size, LV function, oximetry, blood counts and chemistries. Subclinical LPS induced dose-dependent cardiac fibrosis after 3 months, even with low LPS doses that did not affect survival. This has significant implications since recurrent exposure to subclinical LPS occurs commonly, yet has not been previously considered a risk factor for causing cardiac fibrosis or increasing mortality.</p><p>A model was needed to study recurrent exposure to subclinical LPS. Subclinical LPS has been injected into normal human volunteers in several studies, but it is not ethical to expose humans to repeated doses of LPS with unknown consequences. A preclinical animal model was needed, but some animals do not tolerate exposure to low doses of LPS without acute effects including death. This may occur even after initially tolerating a few doses of LPS, making these animals unsuitable for studying more chronic effects. There is a 10,000 fold range in LPS doses for inducing 50% mortality in different species. Humans, rabbits, calves and sheep are more sensitive to LPS than guinea pigs, hamsters or dogs, whereas rats and mice are least sensitive to LPS <xref rid="pone.0061057-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The capacity for rodents to tolerate recurrent LPS challenges without acute lethality makes them suitable for a chronic model.</p><p>There is a 500 fold difference in the 50% lethal dose for LPS in mice compared with humans. Similarly, there are species-dependent differences in dose effects of subclinical LPS. It requires a 250 fold higher LPS dose to produce a similar increase in plasma IL-6 in C57Bl/6 mice as in humans <xref rid="pone.0061057-Copeland1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Species-dependent differences in LPS resistance are largely related to serum factors, rather than intrinsic differences in cell response <xref rid="pone.0061057-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In vitro, cellular responses to LPS are markedly attenuated in the presence of mouse serum compared with human serum.</p><p>Injecting 10 mg/kg LPS i.p. produced serum LPS levels of 58 ng/ml at 24 hours. Since it requires 250&#x02013;500 fold higher LPS doses to produce comparable effects in mice as in humans <xref rid="pone.0061057-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061057-Copeland1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, a LPS level of 58 ng/ml in the mouse may be comparable to LPS levels of 0.1&#x02013;0.2 ng/ml (116&#x02013;232 pg/ml) in humans. This is within the range of subclinical LPS levels found in several human conditions <xref rid="pone.0061057-Manco1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The experimental protocol minimized confounding factors such as LPS tolerance, which develops rapidly (e.g. 24&#x02013;72 hours) after LPS exposure to decrease the responsiveness to LPS for several days. There were no priming effects, where initial exposure to LPS enhanced the response to subsequent LPS exposure. Mice were allowed to recover fully in-between weekly doses of LPS, with neither cumulative nor attenuated responses to subsequent LPS exposure. Measurements were performed 6&#x02013;7 days after an injection to measure the chronic effects of recurrent LPS exposure separate from the acute effects that occur hours after injecting LPS.</p><p>The subclinical phenotype of this model was evident with only minimal or subtle effects that did not persist. LPS caused transient changes in hemodynamic and LV function that resolved after 6&#x02013;24 hours. Weekly injections of LPS for 2&#x02013;3 months were well tolerated with no change in activity, appetite, weight, hemodynamics, LV size or function. Recurrent LPS did not alter oxygen saturation, blood chemistries, renal or hepatic function. Despite this seemingly benign tolerance to weekly subclinical LPS, cardiac fibrosis developed with an increase in mortality after 2 to 3 months.</p><p>The mechanism for subclinical LPS to increase mortality is unknown. Arrhythmias or high grade blocks may cause sudden cardiac death. Chronic arrhythmias were not observed in surviving mice, or in the days preceding death. Terminal arrhythmias and high grade blocks were observed in the minutes to hours before death. Cardiac fibrosis may contribute to arrhythmias and high grade conduction blocks. It is unknown if either cardiac fibrosis or arrhythmias were the cause for sudden death, or merely associated findings. Cardiac fibrosis may develop with low dose LPS, which does not affect survival.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that LPS exacerbates preexisting abnormalities, but have not shown that subclinical LPS alone can cause fibrosis without prior injury. In the liver, hepatic fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation or with chemical insults (CCl<sub>4</sub> or thioacetamide), is promoted by LPS from gut bacteria that activates hepatic stellate cells <xref rid="pone.0061057-Seki1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In the kidney, renal fibrosis induced by urethral obstruction is promoted by TLR4 activation <xref rid="pone.0061057-Pulskens1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the heart, myocarditis induced inflammatory fibrosis is exacerbated by LPS <xref rid="pone.0061057-Blyszczuk1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Thus, LPS accelerates or exacerbates fibrosis induced by pre-existing injuries to the liver, kidney and heart. A novel finding in the current study is that subclinical LPS can induce cardiac fibrosis as a primary effect, without a preceding insult or injury to the heart.</p><p>The mechanisms for LPS-induced cardiac fibrosis are unknown. It was postulated that LPS activates cardiac RAS to induce fibrosis, since RAS activation is a well known cause of cardiac fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0061057-Mehta1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and LPS activates TLR4, RAS and AT<sub>1</sub>-R in the heart and cardiac myocytes <xref rid="pone.0061057-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061057-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061057-Suzuki2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is well established from clinical trials that AT<sub>1</sub>-R blockers effectively inhibits fibrosis, improves LV remodeling and function and prolongs survival <xref rid="pone.0061057-Sciarretta1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061057-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, losartan did not prevent LPS-induced fibrosis, nor did it reduce mortality with LPS. Since a single injection of LPS increases cardiac apoptosis for 1&#x02013;3 days, which is inhibited by losartan <xref rid="pone.0061057-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, it is unlikely that LPS induces recurrent episodes of apoptosis as a mechanism for cardiac fibrosis.</p><p>Losartan attenuated LPS-induced activation of several fibrosis-related genes, including collagen I&#x003b1;1, collagen III&#x003b1;1, MMP2, and MMP9, but did not attenuate LPS activation of TIMP1 or periostin. It may require broader effects on several extracellular matrix proteins to shift the balance between matrix metaloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) to prevent LPS induced fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0061057-Spinale1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Periostin is an extracellular matrix protein that is not normally secreted in adults. Periostin is expressed in response to injury and plays a role in the fibrotic response <xref rid="pone.0061057-Oka1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It is unclear if periostin contributes to, or is a biomarker for LPS-induced fibrosis.</p><p>LPS did not activate other RAS mediated pathways associated with fibrosis, including renin, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or mas receptors. Collectively, these results along with the losartan studies indicate that LPS-induced fibrosis is not primarily mediated by activation of RAS, AT<sub>1</sub>R, or other RAS-mediated pathways.</p><p>LPS increased cardiac expression of IL-6, which plays a role in fibrosis in multiple organs <xref rid="pone.0061057-OReilly1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. IL-6 induces cardiac fibrosis by causing differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts with increased collagen production <xref rid="pone.0061057-Melendez1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In support of this mechanism, LPS increased the density of LV myofibroblasts measured by &#x003b1;-SMA immunostaining. LPS directly activated isolated cardiac fibroblasts in vitro to increase expression of IL-6. Thus fibroblasts may be the cardiac source for increased expression of IL-6 with LPS.</p><p>LPS did not activate IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, or TGF-&#x003b2;. These negative results, along with the lack of involvement of RAS, indicate that LPS induces cardiac fibrosis by unique mechanisms that differ from other pathological conditions associated with cardiac fibrosis.</p><p>LPS induced cardiac fibrosis and increased mortality. Deaths were unexpected without any preceding change in activity, appetite, weights, cardiac function, pulmonary, liver, or renal function. Cardiac fibrosis can cause arrhythmias which were observed in the last few hours immediately preceding death. Although arrhythmias are a common cause of sudden, unexpected death, the evidence linking cardiac fibrosis and/or arrhythmias with death remains circumstantial. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms of LPS-induced fibrosis to determine if these factors can be dissociated. The cardiac fibrosis induced by LPS is unique, and does not involve other common pathways, such as RAS, apoptosis, or TGF&#x003b2;. Unique therapeutic targets need to be identified to abrogate LPS-induced fibrosis to determine if this prevents arrhythmias and/or death.</p><p>The results from this study have broad clinical relevance as recurrent or chronic exposure to subclinical LPS occurs commonly. Circulating LPS increases after ingestion of a high fat, high carbohydrate diet <xref rid="pone.0061057-Amar2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In healthy subjects, transient exposure to LPS causes inflammation associated with insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0061057-Mehta2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This supports the concept of metabolic endotoxemia, where a high fat diet increases circulating LPS levels with inflammation in adipose tissue and insulin resistance that contribute to obesity and diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pone.0061057-Cani1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Circulating LPS levels are elevated acutely and chronically in smokers <xref rid="pone.0061057-Wiedermann1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and with periodontal disease <xref rid="pone.0061057-Pussinen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.
