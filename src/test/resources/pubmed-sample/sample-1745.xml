Recent experience is that the demand for health care outstrips the willingness to increase taxes to finance it, giving rise to a funding challenge. Increased <italic>productivity</italic>&#x02014;a greater flow of treatments and health care for a given expenditure on inputs&#x02014;is seen as an important element in meeting that challenge. Previous research by Bojke, Castelli, Gra&#x00161;i&#x0010d;, Howdon, and Street (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) has measured productivity growth across the whole NHS system between 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 and found that productivity increased approximately by 2%. The aspiration is that the NHS should double that rate in order to meet increasing demand within the financing regime that has been agreed for it. One focus in seeking that improvement is to consider whether some producing units, that is, NHS <italic>Trusts</italic>, that are delivering only modest increases can be induced to emulate those that are already exceeding the requirement. The Carter Review highlights the importance of keeping track of Hospitals' productivity in order to ensure that the improvements required by 2020 are being made (Lord Carter of Coles, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). We examine whether the application of productivity growth measurement, as has been applied to the whole <italic>system</italic>, permits the identification of high and low performing producing units. Our specific focus is on provision of hospital (secondary) health services by organisational units called NHS <italic>Trusts</italic>,
<fn id="hec3847-note-0001"><label>1</label><p>Trusts can provide their services at more than one site, but for the analysis, we consider all the activity of a Trust together.</p></fn>which we henceforth simply term <italic>hospitals</italic>. We address the question of whether the measurement of productivity growth scales down to individual hospitals. If applicable, such methods could be used to identify high performers and use these as examples of good practice for the whole system.</p><p>As with many forms of production, hospital health care involves multiple outputs, produced using multiple inputs. We aggregate the different inputs and outputs using methods that have been derived and utilised for measuring productivity in the English health&#x02010;care system as a whole and construct measures of the annual growth in productivity&#x02014;the differential growth of output to input&#x02014;of 151 hospitals for five pairs of years. Over the full study period, the hospitals show substantial differences. Some exhibit growth in productivity and others decline. There are also differences between hospitals in the growth they have each year and over time: Between&#x02010;hospital differences in year&#x02010;by&#x02010;year growth rates are smaller than the within&#x02010;hospital year&#x02010;on&#x02010;year differences. Hence, there is little if any <italic>consistency</italic> in the productivity performance of hospitals over time.</p><p>This work extends past research into levels of productivity in England's hospitals (Arag&#x000f3;n Arag&#x000f3;n, Castelli, &#x00026; Gaughan, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Castelli, Street, Verzulli, &#x00026; Ward, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) by considering productivity growth at the hospital level. Measures of productivity levels are strongly affected by differences between hospitals that do not reflect performance. For example, a hospital that has inherited a large or overvalued capital stock will have lower productivity. Further, there are regional differences in the allocation of capital to hospitals within the health system we study on account of structural reorganisation. By considering productivity growth, such effects are differenced&#x02010;out along with any other hospital&#x02010;specific idiosyncrasies in valuing or accounting for inputs or outputs. Furthermore, the focus of policy is on improving performance, and this is more directly measured through growth in productivity.</p><p>There is a considerable literature that uses some form of frontier analysis (data envelopment analysis [DEA] or stochastic frontier analysis [SFA]) to measure productivity at the system or unit level (see Hollingsworth, Dawson, &#x00026; Maniadakis, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>, for a review of methods). Frontier models work under the assumption that the existing technology is not fully utilised by the production units. The main advantage of frontier models is their ability to disentangle the source of efficiency change: technological change versus technical efficiency change (Del Gatto, Di Liberto, &#x00026; Petraglia, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Another advantage is the capacity to compare inputs and outputs in different units such as staff number or number of beds in a hospital. However, as the productivity frontier constructed by such methods has a dimension for each input or output included, SFA and DEA approaches are most effective when the number of observed units is large relative to the number of input and output types to consider. In our case, the number of different inputs and outputs is large, and the number of observed units (hospitals) is relatively small. Alternatively, we might apply frontier methods after converting the many observed dimensions of inputs and outputs into a single dimension for each; the method to do this is discussed below. However, using a single input and output dimension would remove the very advantage of frontier methods to analyse multidimensional measures of inputs and outputs.</p><p>The index numbers approach, as other non&#x02010;frontier methods, assumes that production is always technologically efficient (Del Gatto et al., <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The index approach has the main advantage that it does not rely on a parametric specification of the model (as does SFA). This makes it particularly amenable when measuring the productivity of whole health&#x02010;care systems for which it is difficult to correctly specify a unique production function. The health&#x02010;care system comprises a number of smaller production units (hospitals, GP practices, etc.), all of which have their own production function. A further advantage of the index approach is the conversion of many inputs and outputs with different units into a common unit of financial value. The most used index numbers are the Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher, and Tornqvist (Diewert, Balk, Fixler, Fox, &#x00026; Nakamura, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).</p><p>Index numbers, such as the Laspeyres and Paasche indices, are used in National and International Accounts when measuring whole system and private/public sector productivity growth over time. Similarly to the DEA approach, in the National Accounts, productivity is defined as the ratio of outputs to inputs. Outputs are usually differentiated to reflect their differing quality, which is in turn reflected in the prices of the products. When considering the output of the public sector, (market) prices do not usually exist. It is common practice to use cost weights to aggregate different forms of activity into a single measure of output growth. This approach has permeated the measurement of productivity in the English NHS (Castelli et al., <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Dawson et al., <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), and it is the approach we adopt.</p><p>In this setting, the most recent work by Bojke, Castelli, Gra&#x00161;i&#x0010d;, and Street (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) considers the growth in NHS outputs, inputs, and productivity between 1998/1999 and 2013/2014, and they find that outputs have increased more than inputs, 89% versus 82%, and therefore, productivity has increased, by 4%, over the 15&#x02010;year period. Castelli et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and Arag&#x000f3;n Arag&#x000f3;n et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) adapted the methodology developed by Dawson et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) for measuring whole system productivity growth over time to the measurement of health&#x02010;care productivity of single hospitals in a cross&#x02010;sectional context. Further, they used hospitals' productivity ratios (standardised around the national average) to uncover possible drivers of productivity variations across different providers. Castelli et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) found extensive variations across hospitals, ranging between &#x02212;62% and +33% below/above the national average across the years 2008/2009 and 2009/2010, which are highly correlated over time. Arag&#x000f3;n Arag&#x000f3;n et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) also found substantial variation in hospital&#x02010;level productivity, both in the labour productivity and total factor productivity (TFP) measures, for the financial years 2010/2011, 2011/2012, and 2012/2013. In particular, they found productivity ratios to vary between &#x02212;36% and +79% for the labour productivity measure and between &#x02212;50% and +33% for the TFP measure. Distinct from these contributions, we focus on <italic>growth</italic> and thus difference&#x02010;out any time&#x02010;invariant hospital&#x02010;level determinants of productivity, with a view to uncovering robust underlying differences in the performance of hospitals. We find that, unlike productivity levels, productivity growth is not correlated over time.</p><p>The rest of this paper is set out as follows.

From here onwards, we will use the term <italic>link</italic> to refer to any two adjacent years over which we calculate growth.</p><p>To estimate TFP, it is necessary to define and measure both outputs produced and inputs used for each hospital. Growth in both of these can be calculated either directly or indirectly (Eurostat, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; OECD, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). A <italic>direct</italic> volume measure aggregates information about the volume of each type of output (input) produced (used) using their prices as weights. An <italic>indirect</italic> measure usually relies on other type of information, most often expenditure data.</p><p>Following Dawson et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>),
<fn id="hec3847-note-0003"><label>3</label><p>Dawson et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) developed an NHS output index that was utilised in the Atkinson Review (Atkinson, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) and is also used in the U.K. National Accounts (Office for National Statistics, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Unlike Dawson et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), where the NHS output index in the National productivity series is adjusted for quality of hospital inpatient activity, namely, survival rates adjusted by life years gained and waiting times, our NHS output growth index does not include a quality adjustment for the hospital inpatient component. This decision was based on conclusions reached in Arag&#x000f3;n Arag&#x000f3;n et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) that the above indicators would introduce further noise to the hospital Trust level productivity estimates.</p></fn>we construct a set of paired year&#x02010;on&#x02010;year Laspeyres output, input, and productivity indices at hospital level. Outputs consist of all health&#x02010;care goods and services delivered to NHS patients in one of what are termed care <italic>settings</italic>. Examples of these include outpatient services or inpatient spells. As NHS goods and services are delivered free at the point of use, the index uses unit costs as weights, instead of prices, to aggregate the different types of outputs produced. This approach is in line with recommendations set out in the National Accounting literature (Atkinson, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Eurostat, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Inputs into the health&#x02010;care system consist of labour, intermediate goods and services, and capital. As no comprehensive volume data on all factors of production are available, we employ a <italic>mixed</italic> method in determining the growth in these inputs. This combines a direct volume measure of labour input (excluding staff that are engaged on a temporary basis, termed <italic>agency staff</italic>) and an indirect measure, relying on expenditure data, for agency staff, intermediate goods and services, and capital. This also follows recommendations set out in the National Accounts (Eurostat, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; World Bank, <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Given that expenditure is driven by both the volume and price of inputs and our focus is on determining the change in the volume of inputs used in two adjacent years, we need to isolate changes in the volume of inputs used from changes in their prices. To this end, we construct a measure of <italic>constant</italic> expenditure using a price deflator for each input.</p><p>It is well understood that the availability and sources of data used in constructing output and input growth indices may change over time.

This panel represents the assumption that growth over time is consistent and ordering in terms of growth is independent of the specific time period considered. In the bottom panel, both hospitals follow the same pattern of growth, alternating between a 10% increase and 10% reduction in productivity on consecutive years. The only difference between hospitals in this panel is that between Year 1 and Year 2, there is an increase for Hospital A and a decrease for Hospital B. This pattern gives the same ordering of growth over the study period as the top panel after 5&#x000a0;years (i.e., growth between Year 1 and Year 6). However, if we were to calculate growth between Year 1 and Year 5, we would find no difference between the hospitals.

Similar results hold when restricting the sample of hospitals to those that do not experience extreme (more than three standard deviations away form the mean) growth in either outputs or inputs in any link or when considering labour productivity (Arag&#x000f3;n Arag&#x000f3;n et al., <xref rid="hec3847-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="hec3847-sec-0004"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Productivity&#x02014;the effectiveness of converting inputs into outputs&#x02014;is a fundamental and recurring concern for health&#x02010;care systems and is a particular focus of attention for a publicly funded resource&#x02010;constrained system such as the NHS in England. Extensive previous research has established the means of measuring productivity and documenting its growth at the system level. This methodology underpins important policy decisions in respect of future resourcing, with the health&#x02010;care system being given productivity targets as a condition of sustained increased funding. More recently, attention has turned to how those targets can be met. One approach is to identify the units that are performing well, with a view to using those as examples for others to emulate. In this paper, our focus is on a very substantial component of the health&#x02010;care system&#x02014;hospitals&#x02014;and we consider whether the tools and methods of whole system productivity measurement can be utilised to establish productivity at the unit (hospital) level.</p><p>Our approach is designed to give the methods the best chance of success. We adopt the most extensive data and combine it using the methods and experience developed over more than 10&#x000a0;years of productivity analysis. Our focus on measuring growth of productivity removes one major limitation arising from hospital&#x02010;level analysis that specific and time&#x02010;invariant factors might inflate or deflate measures of productivity for particular hospitals. This may be due, for example, to idiosyncrasies in accounting methods or having inherited inflated endowments of inputs (especially relevant in the case of capital). Furthermore, we use a chained index method to insulate our calculations from homogenous system&#x02010;wide changes.</p><p>Notwithstanding these attempts to ensure the best and most consistent measures of productivity performance at the hospital level, our findings indicate very little consistency in measured performance. In terms of productivity growth, good performance is more often followed by poor performance than further good performance and vice versa. This casts considerable doubt on the utility of productivity growth measurement at the level of individual hospitals. Without confidence in a measure of performance and persistence in the ordering of that measure, it is not plausible to identify &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; performers or &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; performers. Although it is clearly tempting to think that the process of adducing evidence in respect of productivity growth for the whole health system might provide evidence of performance of its constituent components, we have established that this is not the case for hospitals and our findings provide a stimulus for further research into the question of how to measure performance at a more micro level. Our findings are also relevant to the question of what organisational unit should be subject to investigation, because it is possible that although productivity growth does not produce consistent performance measures at the level of the hospital, it might be relevant at other less aggregate levels than the national health system, for example, regional health systems or specific clinical departments.</p><p>The failure to identify consistent performance across hospitals does not diminish the value of system productivity measurement. The health&#x02010;care system is composed of a large number of producing units, and if the measurement of performance at the unit level is subject to high variance and serially uncorrelated shocks, the aggregate measure will still be a true reflection of system performance. It is worth stating that our study has not found a particular cause of volatility in productivity measurement at the hospital level. Decomposing outputs and inputs does not reveal one particularly noisy data element. Instead, we find substantial noise at the level of individual hospitals in terms of both inputs and outputs. One potential mechanism behind this observation is heterogeneous effects of national policies. We exclude hospitals that underwent mergers or dissolutions in the study period, but these are not the only institutional changes that can occur, and the effect of these need not be homogenous. For example, the removal of community services from Primary Care Trusts came into effect during our study period. Responses to this policy varied, with some new Community Trusts being created but in other cases hospitals taking over more community care. Such differences can be expected to lead to differences in inputs and outputs at the hospital level, as such changes represent changes in attribution to hospitals. However, at the system level, reattribution per se does not affect productivity across the whole. A second potential mechanism for noise is changes to the <italic>attribution</italic> of inputs and outputs. Suppose that, for example, aggregate inputs are fixed but are allocated differently to individual hospitals in successive time periods, then we would expect to observe potentially very large changes in measured individual hospital productivity but not change in overall productivity. This is broadly consistent with what we have measured.</p><p>Further research would be needed to identify the sources of volatility and examine whether there are alternative measures of productivity with sufficient consistency to guide interventions to improve performance at the hospital level. One potential line of inquiry is to investigate for which hospitals available measures of productivity growth are more reliable. For example, in Arag&#x000f3;n Arag&#x000f3;n et al. (<xref rid="hec3847-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), the relationship between productivity levels and hospital size, as well as other hospital characteristics, has been highlighted as relevant to overall performance. Such differences might also impact on measure reliability, making existing measures more or less appropriate for different subsets of hospitals.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="hec3847-sec-0005"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The Hospital Episode Statistics are copyright &#x000a9;&#x000a0;2008/2009&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;2013/2014, re&#x02010;used with the permission of the Health &#x00026; Social Care Information Centre.
