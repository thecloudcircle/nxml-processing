Immunohistochemistry gradings for 5 biomarkers (CD44, ABCC4, ABCC11, N-Cadherin and pan-Cadherins) and 3 clinical parameters (tumor size, tumor grade and node status) of 298 patient cohort were used to develop a machine learning based statistical algorithm.

Identification of these patients who are at high risk for distant recurrence and hence would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy is intricate and depends upon the tumor biology, clinical and pathological parameters.</p><p id="Par18">Most tests that are currently available to predict risk of distant recurrence for breast cancer utilize quantitative gene expression-based platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These tests are expensive and require specialized equipment in the laboratory. We have developed and validated CanAssist-Breast (CAB) test that uses a cost-effective, gold standard methodology of immunohistochemistry (IHC) along with key clinicopathological factors to determine risk of distant recurrence in early stage HR+ breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">CAB uses IHC based evaluation of expression levels of 5 key biomarkers (CD44, N-cadherin, pan-cadherin, ABCC4 and ABCC11) and three clinicopathological prognostic parameters tumor size, tumor grade and node status (as obtained from the medical records from hospitals where these patients were treated) to arrive at a &#x0201c;CAB-Risk Score&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;CAB Risk Score&#x0201d; classifies patients into two categories, either low- or high-risk for distant recurrence. The detailed rationale for choosing these biomarkers is explained in the prior publication describing the development of CAB test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Briefly, these five biomarkers play a pivotal role in cancer progression, drug-resistance leading to cancer recurrence. CD44 is a stem cell marker, cadherins contribute to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while ABCC4 and ABCC11 are ATP binding cassette transporter proteins involved in drug efflux leading to drug resistance. &#x0201c;CAB Risk Score&#x0201d; classifies patients into two categories, either low- or high-risk for distant recurrence.</p><p id="Par20">The steps involved in the CAB test are described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. It includes an initial sample quality check of the tumor sample by Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining, followed by IHC staining for CAB biomarkers. A machine learning based statistical algorithm uses the IHC gradings of CAB biomarkers along with the patient&#x02019;s clinical parameters to generate a risk score ranging between 0 and 100 with a cut-off at 15.5. Patients with a risk score below the cut-off are considered to `low-risk&#x002bc; of recurrence and patients with risk score above the cut-off are considered to have `high-risk&#x002bc; of recurrence.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CanAssist-Breast (CAB) test work flow: The flow chart depicts various steps involved in the whole process of testing a tumor sample for CanAssist-Beast.

Several factors influence the IHC testing process that may have a bearing on the ultimate result and its interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) have laid down guidelines for analytical validation of IHC based tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Analytical validation is essential to demonstrate the repeatability and reproducibility of a test across variables that affect its&#x02019; performance. Repeatability demonstrates precision among repeated measurements taken under the same conditions, such as in the same run or performed by the same operator. Reproducibility demonstrates precision for measurements taken under different conditions like multiple -operators, laboratories and observers. As per CLSI guidelines, precision for a centralized laboratory developed test like CanAssist-Breast should encompass variations due to runs, operators and pathologists/observers. This study has been carried out based on all these recommendations to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the CAB test using a total of 309 samples as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of Precision study for analytical validation of CAB test: All potential sources of variation in the CAB test have been shown along with the methodology used to analyze.

Furthermore, only those blocks that had more than 30% tumor content as per H &#x00026; E staining were selected for this study to ensure the availability of sufficient tumor tissue for testing multiple markers and for performing repeatability and reproducibility experiments. The patients included in the study were HR+ and HER2-. These patients had tumors which were either N0 (node negative) or N1 (up to 3 positive lymph nodes) and with tumor size of &#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x02009;cm (T1) or 2-5&#x02009;cm (T2). We relied on the hospital for information on tumor size, node status and grade. Out of a total of 309 breast cancer samples used for the study, more than 90% of samples were of disease Stage 1 and 2 and were moderately (Nottingham grade 2) or poorly differentiated (Nottingham grade 3).

The H &#x00026; E stained slides were assessed for tumor content and tissue artifacts like necrosis and hemorrhages. The blocks with tissues of necrosis/hemorrhage greater than 10% were rejected.

CD44, ABCC4, ABCC11 were graded on the cell membrane and N-cadherin and pan-cadherin were graded on the cytoplasm.

Demonstration of the analytical performance is a critical requirement for all the diagnostic tests to ensure that accurate results are reported for every patient. Clinical utility of a test not only requires that the test is clinically validated but also is analytically validated for its precision, repeatability and reproducibility. EGAPP has reported that many of the tests lack either analytical validation or corresponding available data is insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Experiments were designed to prove that the CAB test is reproducible and repeatable across various variables, both technical and subjective. The data presented in this study demonstrates robustness of the test factoring in all potential sources of variability.</p><p id="Par47">One of the challenges inherent in demonstrating the analytical validity of any IHC based test is the lack of comprehensive evaluation criteria and a gold standard of reference. To overcome this, we adopted the evaluation criteria set by CAP and CLSI recommendations on thorough analysis of steps involved in validation of new IHC based tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CLSI has documented detailed procedures for designing repeatability and reproducibility experiments and statistical methodologies for the analytical validation of a test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">As CAB test uses five biomarkers using the IHC technique, we evaluated the variations brought in by IHC gradings for each of these five biomarkers using appropriate statistical methodology. There was strong agreement on gradings for all CAB biomarkers for the operator and run variables with ICC of <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>&#x02009;0.75 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) suggesting that performance of IHC was not influenced by change in operator or the day on which the IHC experiment was performed. Strong agreement on risk scores obtained by the cumulative grading of all biomarkers is demonstrated by Bland Altman plots. The intra-run, inter-run and inter-operator plots have data points within the acceptable limits of agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], indicating that robustness at the level of gradings is translated to risk scores. Further pair-wise agreement analysis for risk categories for these run and operator variables specifically inter-operator (OPA, NPA and PPA&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;93%), and inter-run (OPA, NPA and PPA&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;93%) and intra-run (OPA, NPA and PPA&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;98%) parameters demonstrated that these variables do not affect CAB test based risk category prediction (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">Subjective interpretation/grading of IHC stained slides leading to inter-observer variation is the major drawback of IHC based tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We have addressed this concern by testing inter-observer variation using a large cohort of a sample size of 257. ICC for the IHC gradings for all the five CAB biomarkers (ranged between 0.75 to 0.98, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and Bland-Altman plots for CAB risk score generation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) demonstrated strong agreement between observers indicating that the CAB test does not suffer from inter-observer variability with respect to IHC interpretation and risk score generation (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Pairwise agreement analysis for low-, high- and overall risk predictions had a high concordance of &#x0003e;&#x02009;90% in observer variation experiments (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The performance of the CAB test is evaluated at clinical decision point also (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). High variation at the clinical decision point directly affects patients&#x02019; care by influencing the treatment decisions. Bland Altman plots for inter-observer variation showed high precision thus demonstrating the optimal performance of the test at the clinical decision point.</p><p id="Par50">Although CAB risk score generation uses three clinical parameters along with IHC gradings of five biomarkers, in this study we have not assessed the variations brought in by clinical parameters namely node status, Nottingham grade and tumor size. All the three clinical parameters are taken from the patient&#x02019;s histopathology report routinely used by the clinicians for planning treatment.</p><p id="Par51">Currently available risk-stratifying multi-gene tests use genomic methods and can be expensive especially in low-resource countries where expenses for the tests and treatment are out of pocket. Use of IHC (which is a gold standard technique) helped us to bring down the cost of CAB test to a fraction of the cost of currently available multi-gene tests, thus making it more affordable even in low-resource settings. Furthermore, the CAB test has been clinically validated using a large cohort of 900 retrospective patient samples in a global, multi-center study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] which establishes the clinical utility of CAB comparable to other multi-gene tests. Clinical validation of CAB test in a multi-center randomized trial, similar to the other multigene tests available in the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], would be the next logical approach and such studies are currently underway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">We have thus conclusively shown that CanAssist-Breast, multi-marker IHC-based test is robust across several repeatability and reproducibility variables tested making it a reliable, cost-effective and accurate prognostic test to stratify patients with early stage HR+ breast cancer into low- or high-risk for distant recurrence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
