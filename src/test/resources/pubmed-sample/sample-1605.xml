Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) are also crucial to protect the host from immunopathology and severe disease, but these cells can suppress protective immune responses to malaria. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 expressed by activated T cells is important for trafficking of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells to sites of inflammation and infection. Previous studies demonstrated CXCR3 is expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen during malaria, but the phenotype was not defined. We identified the phenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that expressed CXCR3 in C57BL/6 (B6) mice during acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection by analyzing expression of the transcription factors T-bet and Foxp3. We also investigated if CXCR3 contributes to control of parasite replication and survival. The frequency and number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR3<sup>+</sup> T cells increased dramatically in the spleen of infected B6 mice coincident with increased CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> T cells. CXCR3 was up-regulated on effector CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells as well as Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Consistent with our previous observations, CD4<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells increased in B6 mice during acute infection. T-bet<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs also increased significantly and a high frequency of these cells expressed CXCR3 supporting the notion that these cells may be Th1-like Tregs. Despite this, the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs from infected B6 mice that migrated <italic>in vitro</italic> to the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 was significantly less than na&#x000ef;ve mice. To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> contribution of CXCR3 to control of acute blood-stage malaria, we compared the course and outcome of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection in wild-type (WT) B6 and CXCR3-deficient mice. Parasitemia levels were significantly higher around the time of peak parasitemia in CXCR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared to WT mice but survival was similar suggesting a role for CXCR3 in controlling parasite replication during acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection. Together, our findings indicate Th1-like CD4<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs that express CXCR3 are induced during acute blood-stage malaria and suggest CXCR3 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells may contribute to their migration to the spleen.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>CXCR3</kwd><kwd>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>T-bet</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Canadian Institutes of Health Research<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000024</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">MOP81169</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">CTP79842</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">MOP67211</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7841"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria remains a major global health threat with 90% of the disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria world-wide which represents an increase of 5 million cases compared to 2015 even though the number of deaths remained at ~445,000 per year. Despite extensive studies in humans and mice infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> to identify the immune mechanisms required for protection against blood-stage infection, important gaps in our knowledge remain. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-B cell interactions are essential for control of parasite replication and elimination of infection (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells that express T-bet and secrete IFN-&#x003b3; and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, crucial for generating antibody-mediated immunity, play important roles (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Immunoregulatory mechanisms including the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are vital to protect the host from immunopathology and severe disease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). On the other hand, such mechanisms may suppress protective immune responses.</p><p>Although earlier studies on the role of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in immunity to malaria were not conclusive, recent findings in mice infected with <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> AS or <italic>P. yoelii</italic> support the notion that Tregs suppress Th1 as well as Tfh cell responses (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Indeed, higher blood parasitemia levels are associated with higher frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in humans and mice with malaria. Conversely, a lower frequency of Tregs is associated with better disease outcome. During the acute phase of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS, C57BL/6 (B6) mice, used in the present study, have a significant increase in effector CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells that express T-bet and secrete IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The accumulation and expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells that secrete IFN-&#x003b3; in the spleen are essential for control and elimination of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Although CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs increase significantly in infected compared to na&#x000ef;ve B6 mice, there is a high ratio of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to Tregs in these hosts during acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The lymphocyte-specific chemokine receptor CXCR3 expressed by activated T cells as well as NK cells is important for CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell migration to sites of inflammation and infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Interaction of CXCR3 with its ligands, the C-X-C chemokines CXCL9 (monokine induced by IFN-&#x003b3;), CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein-10), and CXCL11 (interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant) contributes to Th1 cell differentiation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The C-X-C chemokines are induced by IFN-&#x003b3; and are produced by several immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells as well as non-immune cells.</p><p>CXCR3 and other chemokine receptors have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in CM patients and during ECM in mice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Susceptibility to ECM in <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA-infected B6 mice requires CXCR3 expression on pathogenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). <italic>Cxcr3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/</sup><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice are protected from ECM due to reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell sequestration in the brain. Interestingly, CXCR3 expression is also highly up-regulated on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen during <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA infection (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, neither the role of CXCR3 expression on T cells in the spleen during malaria nor the phenotype of the T cells, especially of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, expressing this chemokine receptor have been investigated in mice infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA or in other rodent malaria models. In the present study, we examined CXCR3 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen of B6 mice infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS and identified the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population that express it.</p><p>The T-box transcription factor T-bet is essential for Th1 cell differentiation and effector function due to its ability to activate transcription of the IFN-&#x003b3; gene (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Interestingly, T-bet is expressed on a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells and is thought to be involved in the homeostasis and function of these cells during Th1 inflammation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Recently, it was observed that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs that express T-bet increase in individuals with acute <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In addition to activating transcription of the IFN-&#x003b3; gene, T-bet induces the transcription of other Th1-associated genes including <italic>Cxcr3</italic> inducing up-regulation of CXCR3 expression on effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Increased CXCR3 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells likewise requires T-bet and occurs via a IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent mechanism (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Given the complex interactions between CXCR3 and the transcription factor T-bet on effector CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, we questioned if these Th1-associated markers are differentially expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations during acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection in B6 mice. To address this, we investigated if CXCR3 expression is up-regulated on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in the spleen of infected mice. We also determined if CXCR3 and T-bet are co-expressed on effector CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs during infection. Because we observed that C-X-C chemokine expression is up-regulated in the spleen during <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> migration assays to study the chemotactic ability of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from infected mice to CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Finally, we investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of CXCR3 to immunity to blood-stage malaria by determining the course and outcome of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection in wild-type (WT) B6 compared to CXCR3-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and Parasites</title><p>WT B6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (St. Constant, QC).

The cells were centrifuged, re-suspended in 0.175 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to lyse red blood cells (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), washed, and re-suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FCS, 25 mM HEPES (Life Technologies), 0.12% gentamicin (Life Technologies), and 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies). The total number of spleen cells obtained from individual mice was determined using a hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion (Life Technologies) and was always &#x0003e;95%.

Together, these findings suggest that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, like effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, respond to local cytokines by modifying their chemokine receptors including CXCR3 to promote their migration to sites of inflammation and infection where they function to suppress immune responses.</p><p>The transcription factor T-bet is the master regulator of Th1 cell generation and effector function and is required for IFN-&#x003b3; secretion (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). T-bet is essential for increased CXCR3 expression by directly transactivating the <italic>Cxcr3</italic> promoter (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the absence of T-bet, Th1 cells are unable to migrate <italic>in vivo</italic> to sites of inflammation and fail to migrate <italic>in vitro</italic> in response to the CXCR3 ligands CXCL10 or CXCL11 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Similar to conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg populations have been identified with transcriptional profiles analogous to their effector Th cell counterparts and critical for their suppressive functions (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Indeed, T-bet expression in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs has emerged as important for regulating Th1-mediated inflammation in various disease models in mice including in Foxp3-deficient Scurfy mice, airway hypersensitivity, autoimmune diabetes, and islet cell allograft rejection (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Moreover, disease modifying T-bet<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs also express CXCR3 which facilitate their migration to sites of Type 1 inflammatory responses. Th1-like Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs have been shown to produce IFN-&#x003b3; and to express high levels of inhibitory molecules such as CTLA-4 as well as high IL-10 and TGF&#x003b2; mRNA levels (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs expressing T-bet and CXCR3 have also been described in humans (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>T-bet<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs have been observed in mice infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> suggesting these cells may be important in infections with intracellular pathogens that induce highly polarized Th1 responses (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In the present study, we observed that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs that co-express T-bet and CXCR3 increase significantly in the spleens of B6 mice during acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection. Recent studies indicate T-bet<sup>+</sup> Tregs increase during acute <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection while the frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs that express T-bet is stable in patients after treatment (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The exact role of T-bet<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in suppressing effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses during malaria has not yet been resolved.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a population of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs that co-express CXCR3 and T-bet in the spleen during acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection. Altogether, our findings indicate that CXCR3 expression on effector CD4<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells may contribute to the migration of these cells to the spleen during malaria suggesting a role for CXCR3 in immunity to <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Mice were maintained and handled according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the McGill University Animal Care Committee (ACC).
