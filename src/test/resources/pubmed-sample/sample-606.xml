In general, functional ABC transporters comprise four domains: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) involved in substrate binding and translocation, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis <xref rid="pone.0104892-Procko1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These ABC transporter domains can be located in a single polypeptide (such as Arabidopsis Comatose and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR]), in two polypeptides (such as human ALDP, the human transporters associated with antigen processing TAP1 and TAP2, and the yeast peroxisomal transporters Pxa1p and Pxa2p), or in four polypeptides (such as the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> maltose transporter) <xref rid="pone.0104892-Nyathi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104892-Oldham1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition to the common ABC transporters TMD and NBD, some possess an extra sequence or accessory domain to regulate ATPase activity, channel opening, and interactions between NBD and NBD or NBD and TMD, as in the case of SUR2x/Kir6.2, maltose transporter MalFGK<sub>2</sub>, molybdate/tungstate transporter ModBC, human CFTR, and DrrA <xref rid="pone.0104892-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104892-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Peroxisome, a single membrane organelle in the eukaryotic cell, is involved in lipid metabolism, including &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids. The peroxisome membrane is equipped with peroxisomal ABC transporters for transferring long-chain or extremely long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the peroxisome <xref rid="pone.0104892-Wanders1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In humans, the importance of the peroxisomal ABC transporter is demonstrated by the common genetic disorder, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), caused by mutations in the <italic>ABCD1</italic> gene (encoding ALDP, a peroxisomal half ABC transporter). The disease is characterized by defective peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation and accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in brain white matter, adrenal cortex, and testis, resulting in cerebral demyelination, nerve degeneration, and adrenocortical and testicular insufficiency <xref rid="pone.0104892-Mosser1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104892-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Besides ALDP, there exist two other half ABC transporters, ALDRP and PMP70 <xref rid="pone.0104892-LombardPlatet1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104892-Holzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. They both share amino acid sequence homology with ALDP. ALDP has been shown to form a homodimer with itself or a heterodimer with ALDRP or PMP70 through the interaction between their carboxyl-terminal regions (CTs) <xref rid="pone.0104892-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104892-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Overexpressed human ALDP can functionally complement the yeast strain deleted in the peroxisomal ABC transporters Pxa1p and Pxa2p, as shown by the restoration of cell growth on oleate medium and by &#x003b2;-oxidation activity, suggesting that the homodimer of ALDP is the functional transporter in vivo <xref rid="pone.0104892-vanRoermund1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, murine ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 were shown to be regulated differentially during mouse brain development, indicating that these proteins may not function together at the same time and that they form the functional homodimer at different developmental stages <xref rid="pone.0104892-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. One report, however, suggests that overexpressed ALDRP exhibits substrate specificity overlap and interaction with ALDP in a human cell model, indicating the existence of a functional heterodimer comprising ALDP and ALDRP <xref rid="pone.0104892-Genin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0104892-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104892.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>General schematic of the functional ABC transporter consisting of two half ABC transporters.</title><p>In general, each half ABC transporter contains a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) with or without the carboxyl-terminal region (CT).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104892.g001"/></fig><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, there are two half ABC transporters in the peroxisome, Pxa1p and Pxa2p, both of which are orthologs of human ALDP <xref rid="pone.0104892-Shani1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104892-Bossier1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Co-immunoprecipitation of Pxa1p and Pxa2p has suggested physical interaction between them <xref rid="pone.0104892-Shani2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

The single-gene deletion strains <italic>&#x00394;pxa1</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;pxa2</italic> exhibited the same phenotype (inability to grow on an oleic acid plate and impaired &#x003b2;-oxidation activity) as the double-gene deletion strain <italic>&#x00394;pxa1/pxa2</italic>. Although the Pxa1p and Pxa2p heterodimer has been proposed as the functional transporter, the interaction regions in Pxa1p and Pxa2p have not yet been determined. Like ALDP, both Pxa1p and Pxa2p have a CT, and the significance of this region in protein-protein interaction has not yet been analyzed.</p><p>Using a yeast two-hybrid assay in the present study, we found that the CT at the end of NBD of Pxa2p is required for Pxa1p-Pxa2p interaction. To define the interaction region in detail, we made a series of deletions in the CT of Pxa2p and assayed the effect of the mutations on protein-protein interaction. The results showed that the central part of the CT (designated CT<sub>2</sub>) of Pxa2p was most important for the interaction between Pxa1_NBD and Pxa2_NBD. This conclusion was supported by a pull-down assay. The failure to detect an interaction between the CT of Pxa2p and Pxa1_NBD implied that it functioned in the Pxa1p-Pxa2p interaction not through physical contact with Pxa1p, but rather, by indirect means dependent on the existence of Pxa2_NBD-CT<sub>1</sub>. Further analysis revealed that a point mutation of conserved residues in the CT<sub>2</sub> of Pxa2_NBD-CT abolished its interaction with Pxa1p_NBD or Pxa1p_NBD-CT and displayed proteolysis profiles that differed from that of the wild type. Functional analysis of these mutants indicated that they were defective in transporter function. Taken together, these results suggest that the CT region is required to maintain the native structure of Pxa2_NBD, a prerequisite for the interaction between Pxa1p and Pxa2p and the transporter function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Involvement of the CT of Pxa2p in the interaction between Pxa1_NBD-CT and Pxa2_NBD-CT</title><p>The CT of the human homolog ALDP has been shown to be engaged in protein-protein interaction with itself <xref rid="pone.0104892-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To investigate the importance of the CT of Pxa1p and Pxa2p in Pxa1p-Pxa2p interaction, we performed a yeast-two hybrid assay. Because inclusion of the TMD may give rise to false negative results as a consequence of protein aggregation or degradation (data not shown), we fused the soluble region of Pxa1p and Pxa2p only, which included an NBD and CT region (Pxa1_NBD-CT and Pxa2_NBD-CT) to the GAL4 activation domain (Gal4 AD) and the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA BD), respectively. The CT of Pxa1p ranges from residues 775 to 870 and that of Pxa2p ranges from residues 678 to 853. The CT-truncated proteins were also constructed and designated Pxa1_NBD and Pxa2_NBD, respectively. Results from the yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that Pxa2_NBD-CT, but not Pxa2_NBD, interacts with Pxa1_NBD-CT or Pxa1_NBD, suggesting that the CT of Pxa2p was required for Pxa1p-Pxa2p interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The C-terminal deletion mutant of Pxa1p, Pxa1_NBD, preserved the ability to interact with Pxa2_NBD-CT, indicating that the interactions between the NBDs of Pxa1p and Pxa2p could occur in the absence of the CT of Pxa1p. Because the CT of Pxa2p has critical effects on the interactions between the NBDs of these two proteins, we were prompted to identify how the CT of Pxa2p influences the interactions of the two NBDs. To more specifically focus on the role played by the CT of Pxa2p and to simplify the variables in the interactions of the two NBDs, we used the yeast two-hybrid combination Pxa1_NBD and Pxa2_NBD_CT as starting material.</p><fig id="pone-0104892-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104892.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Two-hybrid analysis of interactions between Pxa2_NBD-CT (or Pxa2_NBD) and Pxa1_NBD-CT (or Pxa1_NBD).</title><p>The EGY48 (pSH18-34) reporter strains that express the indicated hybrid proteins (with the Pxa2 fragment fused to LexA BD and the Pxa1 fragment fused to Gal4 AD) were analyzed for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity on an X-gal plate.

Sequence alignment of the CT regions of Pxa1p and Pxa2p with the ClustalW algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) revealed an extra sequence at the extremely carboxyl end of Pxa2p (from residue 774 to 853) that is absent in Pxa1p. Other regions of the CT exhibited about 21% identity (data not shown). From sequence comparison, we established that the CT of Pxa2p was divided into three parts: CT<sub>1</sub> (from residue 678 to 723), CT<sub>2</sub> (from residue 724 to 773), and CT<sub>3</sub> (from residue 774 to 853) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). To determine which part of the CT of Pxa2p is important in protein-protein interaction with Pxa1_NBD, we analyzed the effect of various CT deletions of Pxa2_NBD-CT on protein-protein interaction by using a yeast two-hybrid assay. To our surprise, deletion of CT<sub>3</sub> did not attenuate the interaction between Pxa1_NBD and Pxa2_NBD-CT. Instead, this deletion slightly enhanced their interaction. Simultaneous deletion of CT<sub>2</sub> and CT<sub>3</sub>, however, completely made this interaction undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Western blot results indicated that all of the mutant proteins were stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

An interaction was not detected between their NBDs, as the CT of Pxa2p was deleted. Interestingly, the involvement of the CT of Pxa2p in the Pxa1p-Pxa2p interaction does not occur through direct contact with Pxa1_NBD, but in a Pxa2_NBD-dependent manner. The limited proteinase K digestion results of Pxa2p mutants defective in CT<sub>2</sub> showed that the CT of Pxa2p stabilizes the structure of Pxa2p_NBD to that required for interaction with Pxa1p. The oleate plate functional assay clearly demonstrated that the CT<sub>2</sub> of Pxa2p is required for transporter function, suggesting that the interactions identified here are functionally related. Finally, the proposition that the involvement of the CT of Pxa2p in maintaining its NBD structure was also corroborated by the interaction between the NBD and CT of Pxa2p in the yeast two-hybrid assay.</p><p>A number of studies have suggested that the C-terminal extension of ABC proteins may be associated with protein-protein interaction between two half ABC transporters. In human ALDP, a study using the yeast two-hybrid assay appeared to show that homo- and heterodimerization occur between C-terminal halves of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 <xref rid="pone.0104892-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Another study showed that in MalK of <italic>E. coli</italic>, its regulatory C-terminal domains remained associated throughout the catalytic cycle, suggesting that the C-terminal domain is involved in stabilization of the MalK dimer <xref rid="pone.0104892-Samanta1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In DrrA of <italic>Streptomyces peucetius</italic>, one study used the disulfide cross-linking assay to show that the LDEVFL motif in the extreme C terminus of DrrA is involved in DrrA-DrrB and DrrA-DrrA complex formation <xref rid="pone.0104892-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Similarly, in our study, we found that the CT of Pxa2p, but not Pxa1p, is required for Pxa1_NBD-CT/Pxa2_NBD-CT dimeric interaction. As clearly demonstrated, the interaction between Pxa1_NBD and Pxa2_NBD-CT may be directly mediated by their NBD domains with the help of the CT of Pxa2p. We could not, however, rule out the possibility that there exists a minor interaction between the CT of Pxa1p and that of Pxa2p; this idea will be addressed in further work.</p><p>An interesting finding in this report is that the involvement of the CT<sub>2</sub> of Pxa2p in the Pxa1_NBD/Pxa2_NBD-CT interaction does not occur through direct contact with Pxa1_NBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Instead, the CT<sub>2</sub> of Pxa2p is required for maintaining the correct structure of Pxa2_NBD in order for it to interact with Pxa1_NBD. The genetic and biochemical results on the point mutations in the CT<sub>2</sub> of Pxa2p support this suggestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g006">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g008">8</xref>). The limited proteolysis assay of these point mutations indicated that new bands appeared on comparison of the peptide map of the wild-type protein and the CT<sub>2</sub>-mutated proteins, implying that the mutations located in the CT<sub>2</sub> of Pxa2p indeed change the Pxa2_NBD-CT structure to a significant extent. Thus, we propose that the CT of Pxa2p may be structurally integrated into the interaction competency of the NBD in Pxa2p. In this model, the CT of Pxa2p should interact with the NBD of Pxa2p. To test this possibility, we analyzed the interaction between the CT and the NBD of Pxa2p by using a yeast two-hybrid assay. The results of this assay were in agreement with our proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Further analytical techniques are required to reveal the whole picture regarding the structural details of the integration of the CT into the complete NBD.</p><p>We also noticed that the CT<sub>3</sub> of Pxa2p has an interesting property. When we compared the yeast two-hybrid results of Pxa1_NBD/Pxa2_NBD-CT<sub>1+2</sub> and those of Pxa1_NBD/Pxa2_NBD-CT, it appeared that the protein-protein interaction was enhanced in Pxa1_NBD/Pxa2_NBD-CT<sub>1+2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104892-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This enhancement was estimated as being up to 22% by &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity assay (data not showed). This result indicates that the CT<sub>3</sub> of Pxa2p may have an inhibitory effect on the interaction between Pxa1_NBD and Pxa2_NBD-CT. Several reports have suggested that the C termini of ABC transporters are involved in regulating ATP binding and NBD interaction <xref rid="pone.0104892-Nichols1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104892-Gerber1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. One of these biochemically well-characterized termini is the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K<sub>ATP</sub> channel), consisting of Kir6.2/SUR2. Four Kir6.2 proteins form the central pore in the membrane, each associated with a regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR2) subunit, which contains TMD, NBD, and the C-terminal extension. Because the SUR2 gene mRNA is alternatively spliced in different tissues, there exist two protein isoforms, SUR2A and SUR2B, differing only in their C-terminal 42 amino acids. Compared with SUR2A, purified SUR2B has been shown to have lower ATPase activity and lower K<sub>M</sub> for MgATP. Their different activities have been proven to result from an inhibitory effect of the C-terminal 42 amino acids of SUR2B. In future, it will be worthwhile to examine the deletion effect of the CT<sub>3</sub> on its ATPase activity in order to characterize the regulatory role of the CT<sub>3</sub> of Pxa2p.</p><p>The mutations Y726L and F731A in the CT<sub>2</sub> of Pxa2p, shown in the present study to disrupt Pxa1_NBD/Pxa2_NBD interaction, correspond to the mutations W679R and L684P in the CT<sub>2</sub> of human ALDP. From the records in the human X-ALD database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.x-ald.nl/">http://www.x-ald.nl/</ext-link>), we found that W679R was the first missense mutation discovered in exon 10 of the ALDP gene <xref rid="pone.0104892-Korenke1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This mutation existed in sibling patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy. The patient and his sister, who was older by two years, had slow neurological progression with disturbances of balance and walking at about the age of 40&#x02013;50 years, and the levels of very long-chain fatty acids in their blood were found to be elevated. An L684P mutation was recorded only in unpublished data by Dr. S.J.S. Steinberg. To date, the protein stability and biochemical properties of these two mutated proteins have not yet been described, and their pathological mechanisms are not clear. Because Pxa2p is the ortholog of ALDP, the mutation effect of Y726L and F731A in Pxa2p on its protein interaction with Pxa1p may provide a significant reference for ALDP protein with W679R and L684P mutations. Thus, the effects of the W679R and L684P mutations in ALDP on protein-protein interaction are worth determining in future. An accurate description of the mutation effect in ALDP may be useful for other pharmacological studies in order to discover drugs that enhance the interactions of mutated proteins and to provide improved treatment for ALD disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains, culture medium, and antibodies</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study were <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> BJ2168, EGY48 (pSH18-34), and W303.1A, which were kindly provided by Dr. S.

Protein samples were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). After blotting, PVDF membranes were incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS buffer for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of primary antibody and overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C. PVDF membranes were then washed three times in TBS for 10 min, followed by incubation in TBS with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1&#x02236;5000) for at least 2 h at room temperature. Protein signals were detected after the adding of Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore). Signals were quantitated by using GeneTools software (SynGene, Frederick, MD) when required.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Ni-NTA affinity chromatography</title><p>Cell extracts were prepared by sonication from yeast strain BJ2168 co-expressing Pxa2_NBD-CT-His/Pxa1_NBD-HA, Pxa2_NBD-CT<sub>1+2</sub>-His/Pxa1_NBD-HA, Pxa2_NBD-CT<sub>1</sub>-His/Pxa1_NBD-HA, or Pxa2_NBD-His/Pxa1_NBD-HA. One milliliter of Ni-NTA resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was pre-equilibrated with a 15&#x000d7; volume of equilibration buffer (10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.6, and 150 mM NaCl) at 4&#x000b0;C and then loaded onto a 10&#x000d7;1 cm (length&#x000d7;diameter) column. The yeast extracts were passed through Ni-NTA columns with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4&#x000b0;C. After sequential washings with a 20&#x000d7; volume of equilibration buffer containing 25 mM imidazole at 4&#x000b0;C, the bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mM imidazole at 4&#x000b0;C and collected at 1 ml/fraction.

The plasmid-encoded Pxa2p wild-type and mutant proteins were full-length proteins with a complete transmembrane region, and their genes were constructed in the pRS414 vector with the cognate promotor sequence upstream of the transcription start site. The oleate plate is composed of 0.7% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), essential amino acids, 1.6% bacto-agar, and a carbon source (0.4% oleic acid dissolved in 2% Tween40 or 2% glucose). The assay was started by preincubating yeast strains in minimal medium supplemented with essential amino acids and 2% glucose. As the OD<sub>600</sub> of each yeast culture was near 5, the same amount of yeast cells (1 OD<sub>600</sub>&#x000d7;1 ml) was pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml sterile water and then allowed it to stand for 30 min. This step was repeated three times for complete glucose depletion in cells. Five-fold serial dilutions using sterile water were then performed. Cells from each dilution (3 &#x000b5;l) were dropped onto the oleate plate directly, followed by incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02013;7 days.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Nien-Tai Hu for critical reading and English editing of the manuscript.
