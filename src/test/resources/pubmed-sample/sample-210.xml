The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) and Reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) in the metastatic process has previously been established. However, in all published studies only a limited number of MMPs/MMP inhibitors was analyzed in a limited number of cell lines. Here, we propose a more comprehensive approach by analyzing the expression levels of several MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-14) and MMP inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK) in different models (five human breast cancer cell lines, 72 primary breast tumors and 30 adjacent normal tissues).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed the expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-14 and their inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK) by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in five human breast cancer cell lines presenting increased invasiveness and metastatic potential, 72 primary breast tumors and 30 adjacent normal tissues.

Like most solid tumors, metastatic disease rather than the primary tumor itself is responsible for death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The metastatic process involves a complex cascade of events, including the organized breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Together, the MMPs are able to process or degrade all ECM components. Each ECM element is cleaved by a specific MMP or MMP group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The activity of these proteases is tightly regulated by specific inhibitors, known as tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Consistent with their role in tumor progression, high levels of a number of MMPs have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Surprisingly, high levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 have also been shown to predict adverse prognosis and correlate with tumor aggressiveness in several different human cancers, including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. TIMPs expression profile could be the result of its action as a multifunctional molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The RECK metastasis suppressor gene was isolated by screening a fibroblast expression library for cDNAs that induced flat revertants in &#x003bd;-Ki-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. RECK encodes a membrane-associated MMP regulator protein that is able to suppress tumor invasion and metastasis by negatively regulating MMPs involved in carcinogenesis, namely: MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Due to these functions, RECK has been described as a good prognosis marker in several tumor types, including breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The ECM degradation and, consequently, the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells is the result of the umbalance between the activities of these multiple factors that compose the proteases/inhibitors equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, each one of these molecules is involved in different stages and processes during tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although the expression and activity profile of MMPs, TIMPs and RECK have already been described in several cell line models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], few reports analyze more than one MMP or MMP inhibitor in different cell lines at the same time, using the same approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, there are no studies which address the complexity of MMPs/inhibitors system in a multi-factorial context. Moreover, there are no reports comparing expression profiles of these important modulators of the metastatic process, in both a cell line model system and in breast tumor tissue samples.</p><p>Here, we analyzed the expression levels of MMPs and their inhibitors, by qRT-PCR, in a panel of five human breast cancer cell lines displaying different degrees of invasiveness and metastatic potential and in 72 primary breast cancer and 30 adjacent non-tumor tissue specimens. The results demonstrate a significant and positive correlation between the levels of MMPs and their inhibitors both in the cell line models and in tumor tissue samples, suggesting that the expression of these molecules, at least at the transcriptional level, might be regulated by common factors and signaling pathways. Therefore, deregulation of only one of these components could be followed by alterations of several other members of the proteases/inhibitors families. Therefore, we suggest that a multi-factorial analysis is crucial to properly evaluate metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and RNA extraction</title><p>Five human breast cancer cell lines displaying different degrees of invasiveness and metastatic potential were used in this study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). 10<sup>4</sup>cell/cm<sup>2 </sup>were seeded onto uncoated or Matrigel-coated plastic dishes and incubated for 3 or 5 days.

Camargo Cancer Hospital and Alfredo Abr&#x000e3;o Cancer Hospital. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of these hospitals, certifying these studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki (Process number 20 of June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2006). Informed consent was obtained from all patients before or after surgery. All of these tissue fragments were obtained during mastectomy by cold scalpel. The adjacent non-tumor tissue was removed at least 4 cm from the tumor border. All tissue samples were dissected by a pathologist, with the help of magnifying glasses, during surgery. The samples were harvested by the pathologist and immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen. These frozen samples were processed for RNA extraction, after informed consent was obtained from the patients. The methodology used for RNA extraction from tissue specimens was that previously described for RNA extraction from cell culture. The RNA quality was evaluated by electrophoresis in agarose gel containing 20 mM guanidine thiocyanate. The RNA samples were quantified and similar quantities were used for cDNA synthesis. Of these, 11 (15.3%) were coded as stage I, 16 (22.2%) as stage IIA, 20 (27.8%) as stage IIB, 9 (12.5%) as stage IIIA, 11 (15.3%) as stage IIIB and 5 (6.9%) as stage IV. Lymph nodes were evaluated in these tumors samples: 41 (56.9%) displayed compromised lymph nodes. The status of the molecular markers estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was analyzed in 56 tumors, of which 41 tumors (73.2%) were positive for ER and 30 (53.6%) for PR.

Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows the primers used, with the optimal concentration (in range of 100 nM to 600 nM). Cycling conditions were 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min followed by 10 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec and 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec. For quantification, the target genes were normalized to the internal standard GAPDH, HPRT, &#x003b2;-actin and &#x003b2;-tubulin genes. The amplification efficiency analyzed was calculated for each gene from the given slope in linear regression curve of Ct values versus log of cDNA concentration. The corresponding PCR efficiency (E) of one cycle in the exponential phase was calculated according to the equation: E = 10<sup>[-1/slope]</sup>.

The results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) demonstrated that the relative levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-14, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK were generally higher in highly invasive and metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T), when compared to less aggressive ones (MCF-7 and ZR-75-1). The levels of MMP-2 and MMP-14 were significantly elevated (p &#x0003c; 0.001) in the Hs578T cell line relative to those of less aggressive cell lines. The MDA-MB-231 cell line displayed significantly higher mRNA levels of MMP-9 and MMP-14 than MCF-7 (p &#x0003c; 0.001).

Patients diagnosed and treated before further extension of the tumor present higher cure rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The role of MMPs and their specific inhibitors in the metastatic process is well established. Nowadays, there are more than 20 MMPs identified in humans, and several MMP inhibitors, each one of these molecules being involved in different steps of tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In spite of the complexity of MMPs/MMP inhibitors system, all previous studies which analyzed the status of these molecules during mammary tumor progression only focused on a small number of MMPs/MMP inhibitors in a limited number of models. Here, we proposed a more extensive approach by analyzing the mRNA expression levels of different MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-14) and MMP inhibitors by qRT-PCR (TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK) in several models (five human breast cancer cell lines, 72 primary breast tumors and 30 adjacent normal tissues).</p><p>The verified mRNA expression levels, obtained by qRT-PCR, suggested that breast cancer progression from pre-malignant stages to highly invasive and metastatic carcinomas could be accompanied by increased expression of MMPs and their inhibitors. The total RNA from a panel of five human breast cancer cell lines, displaying increased degrees of invasiveness and metastatic potential, were used to perform this quantitative RT-PCR assay. In the cell model used, the levels of all analyzed MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-14) were, in almost all cases, higher in cell lines with elevated invasive and metastatic capacities (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T) when compared to less aggressive ones (MCF-7 and ZR-75-1). These results corroborate the data previously obtained by other groups, in which MMPs expression in breast cancer cell models positively correlates with a highly aggressive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We found similar mRNA expression profiles for all analyzed MMP inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK). At first sight, these results seem contradictory, since these molecules were described as MMP inhibitors. However, elevated mRNA expression levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 have been previously detected in breast cancer cell lines with high invasive and metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, several reports describe TIMPs as multifunctional molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, these molecules were both able to suppress and to promote tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, high expression levels of RECK, a membrane-associated MMP regulator protein, which is able to suppress tumor invasion and metastasis, were associated with better prognosis in several types of tumor, including breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, our results demonstrate that RECK mRNA expression level is increased during breast cancer progression. Thus, at first sight, these data seem to be at variance with the previous studies, suggesting that increased RECK levels could be associated not with better prognosis, but with late clinical stages. Nevertheless, other reports demonstrated that elevated levels of RECK were associated with better prognosis only for patients in late clinical stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, tumors that present overexpression of RECK could display a better clinical course, depending on the enzyme/inhibitor context. Thus, induction of RECK gene expression, observed during breast cancer progression, could be a cellular response to enhanced expression and activity of MMPs. In this context, the ECM proteolysis equilibrium could be maintained by re-establishment of the MMPs/inhibitors balance.</p><p>The role of cell-ECM elements interaction in regulation of expression and activity of these molecules was evaluated. The gelatin degradation ability of MMP-2 and MMP-9, evaluated by zymography assays, was significantly increased in cultures seeded onto Matrigel, when compared to those seeded onto uncoated plastic. Moreover, in highly aggressive cell lines, enhanced MMP activity was observed in less invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells, corroborating the data obtained in mRNA expression analysis. However, among the analyzed proteases, only MMP-2 expression was significantly modulated by cell-ECM elements interaction. These results suggest that increased proteolytic activity is independent of transcriptional activation, corroborating previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that the transcript levels of all studied MMP inhibitors are significantly modulated by the reconstituted basal lamina. This regulation of TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK mRNA levels by cell-Matrigel contact was significant only in highly invasive and metastatic cell lines. Therefore, the intense ECM degradation is correlated with increased MMP inhibitor expression. The ECM supplies mechanical support to cells and structural integrity to tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, ECM performs an instructive role, since it is a reservoir of cytokines, and of growth and differentiation factors, which can be discharged and/or activated during proteolysis of ECM elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] by MMPs, contributing to the crosstalk between tumor cells and the microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, the high mRNA expression levels of MMP inhibitors, found in highly aggressive cell lines, probably reflects a cellular reaction mechanism to intense ECM remodeling, as previously discussed. Thus, during ECM degradation, an important factor involved in induction of TIMPs and RECK can be discharged and/or activated. Our results corroborate this hypothesis, since we demonstrated that ECM is important only in modulation of gene expression of MMP inhibitors and, moreover, only in highly invasive and metastatic cell lines. Therefore, we suggest that this negative feedback mechanism of induction of protease inhibitors, during breast cancer progression, occurs for the re-establishment of the MMP/inhibitors balance and, consequently, for homeostasis of ECM proteolysis.</p><p>Cellular models are commonly used in Cell and Molecular Biology studies due to the limited source of tissue samples. However, enrichment for malignant cells and absence of stroma may compromise comparisons between cell lines and tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, to discard possible cell culture artifacts, we also analyzed the expression of MMPs and their inhibitors in primary breast cancer tumor samples by qRT-PCR. The results obtained demonstrate, in a more general scenario, that the mRNA expression levels of MMPs are significantly higher in tumor samples than in adjacent non-tumor tissues. On the other hand, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK gene expression levels were significantly lower in tumors when compared with adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a significant positive correlation between the gene expression levels of these proteases and their inhibitors in primary breast tumors from patients. Therefore, we suggest that increased expression of genes responsible for ECM degradation is coordinately accompanied by increased expression of their specific inhibitors and that the levels of MMPs, TIMPs and RECK transcripts may be regulated by common factors and signaling pathways.</p><p>Corroborating other studies in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we found no significant association between the mRNA expression levels of the MMPs analyzed and clinical-pathological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These results suggest that the MMPs may supply independent prognostic information. However, there are conflicting results on the prognostic value of these proteases in this model. These differences can, at least in part, be due to the different methodologies used and to possible modulation of MMPs by adjuvant systemic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, the TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and RECK transcript levels did not correlate with the clinical parameters from patients. The status of PR was an exception, which showed a significant correlation with TIMP-1 gene expression only. Likewise, we suggest that expression of the analyzed MMPs inhibitors may supply independent prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the results obtained demonstrate that MMPs and their specific inhibitors are overexpressed in more aggressive breast cancer cell lines. However, it is likely that each one of these molecules plays distinct roles in acquisition of the invasive and metastatic capacity. This complexity of the MMPs-inhibitors system is intensified by a strong correlation found between the expression levels of these key regulators of the metastatic process. Thus, we suggest that the expression analysis of only one of these molecules or the independent quantification of these molecular markers does not provide sufficient information to elucidate the pathological proteolytic mechanisms associated with the tumor. Therefore, simultaneous analysis of the expression status of these molecules could be a better parameter to determine the most adequate therapy for each patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CM: conditioned medium; ECM: extracellular matrix; ER: estrogen receptor; MMP: matrix metalloproteinases; PR: progesterone receptor; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RECK: reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs; SD: standard deviation; TIMP: tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RCSF was responsible for most of the experimental work and interpretation of some of the results.
