However, few studies have investigated the effects of aerobic exercise on acute lung injury (ALI). In 2008, Mussi <italic>et al. </italic>demonstrated the beneficial effects of exercise in a rat model of pulmonary inflammation induced by lung ischemia-reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some effects of exercise have been reported also in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) models of ALI. Cannon and Kluger showed in 1984 that mice trained on running wheels and then injected with <italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic>had a significantly higher survival rate than sedentary mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. More recently, Ramos <italic>et al. </italic>showed that exercise reduced neutrophilic inflammation and exhaled NO levels in mice submitted to intra-nasal instillation of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. LPS is one of the major proinflammatory constituents of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and has been largely used in animal models of acute lung inflammation where neutrophils, acute phase cytokines and reactive oxygen species play major roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the protective effect of exercise in a model of LPS-induced ALI. For this purpose, we analyzed lung mechanics, lung tissue inflammation, protein leakage, pulmonary and systemic cytokine levels, the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (Gre) in lung tissue and pulmonary antioxidant enzyme activity in mice instilled with LPS after five weeks of daily aerobic exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was approved by the review board for human and animal studies of the School of Medicine at the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil), protocol 0402/08.

Afterwards, a maximal exercise capacity test (test 1) was performed with a 5-minute warm-up (25% inclination, 0.2 km/hour) followed by an increase in treadmill speed (0.1 km/hour every 2.5 minutes) until animal exhaustion, that is, until they were not able to run even after 10 mechanical stimuli. Maximal aerobic capacity (100%) was established as the maximal speed was reached by each animal. Mice from the Exe and Exe + LPS groups were then trained using low intensity exercise (50% of the mean maximal speed) for 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 5 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The maximal exercise capacity test was repeated for all animals after five weeks (test 2).

Animals from the Control and Exe groups received one intratracheal instillation of 0.05 ml saline solution. For intratracheal instillation, the mice were anesthetized with ketamine (0.04 ml/mice) and xylasine (0.1 ml/mice); then, a 1 cm-long midline cervical incision was made to expose the trachea, and LPS or saline was instilled using a bent 27-gauge tuberculin needle. The cervical incision was closed with a 5.0 silk suture, and the mice were returned to their cages. The animals recovered rapidly after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of the exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) concentration</title><p>Twenty-four hours after the intratracheal instillation with saline or LPS, the animals were anesthetized using pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg i.p.), tracheostomized, and mechanically ventilated at 60 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg using a Harvard 683 ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA, USA). eNO levels were measured at the expiratory port of the ventilator using a Mylar bag (3 to 6) for five minutes. The concentrations of eNO were measured by chemiluminescence using a fast-responding analyzer (NOA 280; Sievers Instruments Inc., Boulder, CO, USA). Before each measurement, the analyzer was calibrated with a certified 47-ppb NO source (White Martins, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) and a zero NO filter (Sievers Instruments Inc.). To avoid environmental contamination, an NO filter was attached to the breathing circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Respiratory system mechanics</title><p>The tracheal pressure (Ptr) was measured using a pressure transducer (DP 45-28-2114, Validyne, Northridge, CA, USA) connected to a side tap in the orotracheal cannula.

LPS instillation resulted in increased levels of eNO, higher numbers of total cells and neutrophils in BALF, higher number of neutrophils and TNF-&#x003b1; positive cells in the lung parenchyma, higher values of pulmonary resistance and elastance, increased protein leakage, increases of IL-6 and IL-10 levels in plasma, increases of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and KC levels in BALF, and higher activities of GPX and GR in lung tissue. We demonstrated that the low intensity exercise performed during the five weeks before intratracheal instillation of LPS decreased pulmonary resistance and elastance, inhibited neutrophilic tissue infiltration and the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; in lung tissue, decreased the concentration of eNO, increased the expression of SOD-2, glucocorticoid receptors, IL-6 and IL-10 in lung tissue and the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; in BALF. These results suggest that aerobic exercise may play an important role in protecting the lung from the inflammatory effects of LPS-induced ALI by altering the inflammatory profile and increasing the expression of anti-oxidants in lung tissue.</p><p>Few studies to date have investigated the effects of aerobic preconditioning on the inflammatory changes involved in acute lung injury. MUSSI <italic>et al. </italic>evaluated the benefits of exercise in a rat model of pulmonary inflammation induced by lung ischemia-reperfusion and observed decreases in protein leakage and plasma levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; and an increase in SOD activity in trained animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the present study, we used intratracheal instillation of LPS as a model of ALI induced by gram-negative bacteria. The main difference between the study of MUSSI <italic>et al. </italic>and ours was the marked effect of exercise on decreasing LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation as assessed by neutrophilic infiltration and eNO.</p><p>We observed an effect of both LPS and exercise on the release of IL-6. IL-6 is one of the first acute phase cytokines released in sepsis/endotoxemia and is followed by increases in the levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consistently, there was an increase in IL-6 levels in both plasma and BALF of LPS-instilled animals in our model. Whether the increasing of pulmonary and plasmatic IL-6 in ALI is detrimental or protective is controversial. IL-6 was previously considered exclusively as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and the circulating levels of IL-6 were directly correlated with the severity of ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Currently, the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Evidence for the protective anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 is derived from studies that show that endogenous IL-6 in endotoxin-induced ALI controls the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophilic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; also, the administration of IL-6 induces SOD production and reduces LPS-induced neutrophilic infiltration in liver in a model of endotoxemia in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Further, it has been reported that IL-6 plays a protective role in limiting the disruption of the alveolar barrier by neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>An exercise-induced increase in IL-6 expression in lung tissue was observed in our trained animals of both the Exe and LPS + Exe groups. Evidence regarding the effects of exercise on the release of IL-6 is accumulating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. An increase in circulating levels of IL-6 is consistently found during aerobic exercise; however, a decline in the levels of IL-6 has been observed during the post-exercise period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The dynamics of the plasma variation of IL-6 levels induced by exercise could explain the low levels of plasmatic IL-6 observed in our Exe group because this analysis was performed 72 hours after the last training session.</p><p>IL-6 has been shown to stimulate the production of IL-10, a cytokine with well known anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, in our animals the higher tissue expression of IL-6 was associated with the higher expression of IL-10 in lung tissue; we further observed a negative association between these two anti-inflammatory cytokines and the density of neutrophils in lung tissue.</p><p>Distinct mechanisms have been proposed for the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 in acute or chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In acute inflammatory responses, as those elicited by LPS, IL-6 operates to control the extent of tissue inflammatory responses by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of anti-inflammatory molecules. When chronically released, as when induced by repeated bouts of exercise, IL-6 could induce the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects by modulation of the immune system, as suggested in previous studies that showed that IL-6 treatment may modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autoregulate serum IL-6 levels in response to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, prolonged administration of IL-6 in humans led to adrenal enlargement and identification of IL-6 receptors in the adrenal cortex in mice led to the suggestion that the direct stimulatory effects of IL-6 mediate glucocorticoid release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Increased glucocorticoid secretion leads to the restraining of the further production of pro-inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], thus preventing propagation of the stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We believe that exercise could have induced the release of small doses of IL-6 after each training period in our animals, and this would chronically modulate the HPA axis to stimulate the constant release of glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although we did not measure the serum levels of glucocorticoids, the increase in the expression of glucocorticoid receptors in pulmonary inflammatory cells in the trained animals suggests that modulation of the HPA axis could be one of the anti-inflammatory effects induced by exercise in our model. Taken together, our findings suggest that pulmonary release of IL-6 and IL-10 is a major mechanism involved in the protective effect of exercise in this LPS-induced ALI model.</p><p>We observed an interaction effect of LPS and exercise in increasing the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; in BALF, indicating that exercise exacerbates the effect of LPS in increasing IL-1&#x003b2; levels. IL-1&#x003b2; is involved in the repair of the alveolar epithelium in the early phase of ARDS through activation of the epithelial epidermal growth factor/transforming growth factor &#x003b1; pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. One of the most important factors that determine the severity of lung injury in ARDS is the magnitude of injury to the alveolar epithelial barrier. The possibility of decreasing the inflammatory process at an early stage or accelerating tissue repair can be a major determinant of recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although the process of alveolar epithelial repair involves several growth factors, cytokines and various extracellular matrix components, it is possible that a further protective effect of exercise on ALI is to promote early tissue repair through IL1-&#x003b2; release.</p><p>Levels of TNF-&#x003b1; were not elevated in BALF after LPS instillation but increased expression of TNF-&#x003b1; in lung tissue was observed in LPS-treated animals. Aerobic exercise resulted in a significant effect on decreasing LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; expression. Moreover, values of TNF-&#x003b1; in lung tissue were correlated with the density of neutrophils. TNF-&#x003b1; is a major mediator of sepsis and endotoxin-induced ALI; after endotoxin infusion in animals, the level of TNF-&#x003b1; peaks in one to two hours in the serum and in eight hours in BALF. However, due to its short half-life, TNF-&#x003b1; is rapidly cleared and returns to baseline levels within a few hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We believe that this dynamic of the release and clearance of TNF-&#x003b1; could explain the observed low levels of this cytokine in the BALF of our animals, which was collected 24 hours after LPS instillation. We also observed a striking decrease of eNO in our exercised animals. Elevated NO levels are thought to play a central role in tissue damage observed during septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Previous results suggest that NO release after LPS challenge is mediated through IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Based on previous observations that pretreatment with IL-6 decreased the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, NO and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in a model of endotoxemia in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we suggest that in our model, the low levels of eNO and TNF-&#x003b1; in the exercised animals could, at least in part, be secondary to the continuous release of IL-6 induced by exercise. The negative correlation between the levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in lung tissue in our animals is compatible with this hypothesis.</p><p>The aerobic exercise did not alter the effects of LPS on KC release and protein leakage in BALF. These findings were unexpected because KC is a major neutrophil chemotactic factor, and exercise induced a significant reduction in neutrophil density. KC levels were not measured in plasma or pulmonary tissue, limiting the interpretation of our results.</p><p>We observed an effect of exercise on decreasing pulmonary resistance and elastance in LPS-instilled animals. Alteration of resistive forces and tissue viscoelastic properties is a major characteristic of ALI and is associated with alveolar barrier disruption, alveolar edema, surfactant dysfunction, collapse and alveolar inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In our animals, there was no significant effect of exercise on protein leakage, and the decrease of pulmonary resistance and elastance in LPS-instilled exercised mice is likely related to the decrease in pulmonary inflammation. The significant correlation between the levels of eNO and values of resistance and elastance is consistent with this mechanism.</p><p>To investigate the role of oxidative stress, we analyzed the enzymatic activities of GST, CAT, GPX, and GR, the levels of MDA and the expression of SOD-2 in lung tissue. The levels of MDA, which were used as an index of oxidative stress, were not different between the LPS group and controls. Previous studies have shown that the levels of MDA peak four to five hours after LPS instillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Changes in MDA levels can be undetectable after 8 or 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], as observed in our animals. Moreover, we observed that LPS instillation induced activation of the antioxidant glutathione pathway by increasing the activities of GPX and GR, indicating a possible physiologic response to an oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Exercise determined an increase in the expression of SOD-2 in lung tissue. SOD-2 is exclusively localized to the mitochondria, a critical cell organelle both in cellular energy metabolism and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Overall, SOD-2 is most highly expressed in alveolar type II epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, cell types with relatively high metabolic capacity, and plays a major role in protecting lung tissue against free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our results show that aerobic exercise plays an important role in protecting the lung from the inflammatory effects of LPS-induced ALI. The effects of exercise are mainly mediated by the increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidants, suggesting that aerobic exercise can modulate the inflammatory-anti-inflammatory and the oxidative-antioxidative balance in the early phase of ARDS.</p></sec><sec><title>Key Messages</title><p>&#x02022; Aerobic exercise performed during five weeks prior to LPS instillation attenuates the pulmonary changes induced by LPS.</p><p>&#x02022; The beneficial effects of exercise in this ALI model are mainly mediated by the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 and by the expression of SOD-2.</p><p>&#x02022; Our data suggest that exercise can modulate the inflammatory-anti-inflammatory and the oxidative-antioxidative balance in the early phase of ALI.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALI: acute lung injury; ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; BALF: bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CAT: catalase; CTR: control; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; eNO: exhaled nitric oxide; Ers: respiratory elastance; Exe: exercise; GPX: glutathione peroxidase; GR: glutathione reductase; Gre: glucocorticoid receptors; GSSG: oxidized glutathione; GST: glutathione S-transferase; H &#x00026; E: hematoxylin and eosin; HPA: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; LPS: <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>lipopolysaccharide; MDA: malondialdehyde; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PMN: polymorphonuclear; Ptr: tracheal pressure; Rrs: respiratory system resistance; SOD: superoxide dismutase; SPSS: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; V': airflow; V: lung volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CTRG participated in the design of the study, carried out the experimental protocol, the immunohistochemistry reactions and the morphometric analyses, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
