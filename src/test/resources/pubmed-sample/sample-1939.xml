The questionnaire was based on a review of the relevant literature. After review by an expert panel and focus group discussion, 22 items were dropped and 2 new items were added. The resulting 65-item questionnaire with satisfactory content validity (content validity indices&#x02265;0.80) and face validity was tested on 110 NHS Health Check attendees in primary care in a cross-sectional study between 21 May 2014 and 28 July 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following analyses of data, we reduced the questionnaire from 65 to 26 items.

In England, it accounts for a third of deaths and costs the National Health Service (NHS) and the UK economy &#x000a3;30&#x02009;billion annually.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Modifiable lifestyle risk factors, associated with 90% of CVD,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> contributed to only 34% of the overall decline in CVD mortality in England between 2000 and 2007.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In 2010/2011, there were 1.4&#x02009;million CVD-related hospital admissions, of which 60% were for people younger than 75 and more than half as an emergency. Further gains could be made in preventing long-term illness and disability associated with CVD while reducing healthcare costs by promoting healthier lifestyle changes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>The NHS Health Check programme may be important for preventing premature CVD while reducing healthcare costs therein by identifying individuals at increased risk of CVD, raising their awareness of CVD risk and helping them manage their risk.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> This CVD risk assessment and management programme was launched by the Department of Health in April 2009 in England among those aged 40&#x02013;74&#x02009;years free of vascular disease diagnosis.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It aims to prevent heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease while reducing health inequalities. Individuals&#x02019; sociodemographics, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking and family history of CVD are used to predict CVD risk.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In addition to lifestyle advice given to all participants, people at high risk of CVD are invited for further consultations and offered statins and behaviour change support in relation to physical activity, smoking cessation, safe alcohol consumption and healthy diet. Projected programme cost is &#x000a3;180&#x02013;&#x000a3;243&#x02009;million/year with estimated cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) at &#x000a3;3000.1<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>To adopt healthy lifestyle behaviours related to diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption, the general population must be aware of CVD risk.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In the context of the NHS Health Check Programme, CVD risk awareness refers to the accuracy of perceived risk of CVD against predicted CVD risk, general knowledge of CVD and what one can do to lower predicted CVD risk. Whereas predicted CVD risk refers to one&#x02019;s chance of experiencing a heart attack or stroke,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> perceived risk of CVD refers to a person&#x02019;s perception of their CVD risk. While as many as 40% of the general population underestimate their CVD risk, 20% overestimate their risk.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> False reassurance may lead to adoption and/or maintenance of unhealthy behaviours contributing to the premature onset of CVD. Low CVD risk awareness is reported among men, inner city residents and people of lower socioeconomic status.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 14 15</xref> It is not known if the Health Check results in improved CVD risk awareness.</p><p>Although several validated questionnaires measure knowledge, perceptions of CVD or intention to change behaviour,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> no short, validated questionnaire assesses CVD risk awareness using all of these scales. Until now studies examining the accuracy of perceived risk and knowledge of CVD relied on non-validated tools.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The problem with using non-validated tools is that the questions may not accurately and reliably capture individuals&#x02019; views or measure what they intend to measure. The aim of this work was to develop a questionnaire with satisfactory face, content validity and reliability to assess patients&#x02019; awareness of CVD risk among NHS Health Check attendees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The first phase of development of the questionnaire was guided by a literature review, an expert panel and a patient focus group.

The ABCD Risk Questionnaire may be used for evaluating the accuracy of perceived CVD risk, general knowledge of CVD and intention to change behaviour in regard to diet and exercise among NHS Health Check attendees. Agreement between perceived and predicted CVD risk suggests that the tool performs well in assessing perceived CVD risk. As the questionnaire was developed using both an expert panel and a patient focus group, it ought to be relatively easy to understand for both patients and clinicians. If NHS Health Check recommendations change over time, it may need to be updated.</p><p>Critics of the NHS Health Check programme point to the lack of its evidence base.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref> The majority of evaluations focused on coverage and uptake, statin prescribing, new diagnoses and CVD risk factor reduction.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;49</xref> As there was no instrument measuring CVD risk awareness, no studies examined the patients&#x02019; understanding of CVD risk among NHS Health Check attendees. CVD risk presentation was shown to increase the accuracy of perceived risk by 10%. When risk information is repeated, this leads to small but significant reductions in predicted CVD risk.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A national study showed modest reductions in 10-year predicted CVD risk among NHS Health Check attendees in the first 4&#x02009;years.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> A limitation of using predicted 10-year risk of CVD is the underestimation of CVD risk among women and younger people.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> More research is needed to establish whether the programme improves NHS Health Check attendees&#x02019; awareness of CVD risk and whether the programme has an impact on predicted lifetime CVD risk.</p><p>The ABCD Risk Questionnaire was developed on a non-risk stratified population after their initial NHS Health Check consultation as the NHS Health Check programme is administered to all eligible people free of vascular disease diagnosis irrespective of their level of CVD risk. The questionnaire does not encompass all aspects of CVD risk observed in the general population. Questions on smoking and drinking were progressively eliminated as they did not apply to most study participants. As questions on diet and exercise pertained to all people regardless of their level of CVD risk, such questions that reliably distinguished between study participants were selected for inclusion. Although fruit and vegetable intake is only one aspect of diet in the EatWell Guide recommended for use in NHS Health Check,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> it is the only assessment of diet recorded during the NHS Health Check. The resulting questionnaire contains questions based on data collected during NHS Health Check to enable subsequent programme evaluation.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Future studies examining populations at increased CVD risk can look into incorporating smoking and alcohol into the ABCD Risk Questionnaire to learn about these individuals&#x02019; preconceptions and attendance of follow-up care.</p><p>Judging by the number of items reduced in various stages of development, the ABCD Risk Questionnaire was largely shaped by analysis of data from 110 NHS Health Check attendees completing the 65-item questionnaire. This study population was representative of the population that took up the NHS Health Check programme between 2009 and 2014 in terms of sociodemographics including the proportion of men (46.4%), ethnic minorities (5.4%), individuals from the most deprived two-fifths (40.9%), and clinical risk factors including mean total cholesterol (5.42 (95% CI 5.19 to 5.64)), body mass index (27.24 95%&#x02009;CI 26.17 to 28.31), smokers (18.2%) and those at high CVD risk (4.5%).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> As higher levels of deprivation are partly due to having less education,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> questionnaire development was not limited to people with higher education. Compared with the national evaluation, similar levels of high CVD risk were observed despite the fact that the study population contained more younger people aged 40&#x02013;59 years (77.3%).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The recruitment of hard-to-reach groups including younger people, socioeconomically deprived individuals and ethnic minorities by community outreach providers in community venues outside of conventional working hours is consistent with prior literature.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 52&#x02013;54</xref>
</p><p>A possible limitation to face validity is that the patient focus group evaluating the 69-item questionnaire was not representative of the target population. Whereas the NHS Health Check programme is administered to both men and women and members of ethnic minorities, the focus group consisted only of white women. Furthermore, as these women had postgraduate education and worked in a health-related field, they may have had higher health literacy than the general population eligible for the NHS Health Check programme. Clarity, appropriateness, biases and presentation of information may have been differentially assessed by people with different levels of health literacy. A community-based recruitment method aiming to recruit some of the hard-to-reach groups may have been more effective in getting a more representative patient focus group.</p><p>Additional studies should be conducted with larger samples to confirm the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. It would be useful to replicate the factor analytic process on an independent, larger sample to confirm the generalisability of these findings.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
