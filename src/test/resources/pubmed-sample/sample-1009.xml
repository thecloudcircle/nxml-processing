However, healthcare payers are reluctant to fund such procedures, viewing them as purely cosmetic. This has resulted in a flurry of studies assessing quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction following body contouring surgery in this cohort of patients to establish an evidence base to support the idea that body contouring is as much (or even more) a functional procedure as it is cosmetic. However, the methods employed in these studies are seldom ideal, and hence the conclusions are unreliable. The gold standard to assess QoL and patient satisfaction is to use patient specific psychometrically validated patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. Developing such measures consists of a three-step process which includes a review of the current literature, qualitative patient interviews to determine what patients consider the most important, and expert opinion. This study aims to appraise the currently available literature on assessment of QoL and patient satisfaction in body contouring surgery patients. This will hopefully provide an understanding of methodological weaknesses in current studies and inform future investigators of the design of ideal instruments for assessing QoL and patient satisfaction in body contouring patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Body contouring surgery has undergone a rapid expansion in the last decade, becoming one of the fastest growing areas within plastic surgery. As the number of obese individuals continues to increase, bariatric surgery has come to the fore as the method of choice for rapidly losing excess weight with approximately one quarter of patients opting for bariatric surgery [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, when a previously obese or morbidly obese individual loses a massive amount of weight, it results in cutaneous contour deformities on various parts of the body. These cutaneous deformities may then lead to psychological distress as well as functional problems, offsetting the positive benefits brought about by weight loss surgery [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence body contouring surgery would intuitively appear to be the next step in rehabilitating the obese patient with massive weight loss (MWL).</p><p>However, it has been a challenge to convince healthcare payers of the importance of body contouring procedures to the overall outcome of massive weight loss patients. Whereas funding for bariatric surgery has become easier to obtain due to mounting evidence of its benefits on the health of obese individuals and the economic implications of this benefit, it has yet to filter down to body contouring surgery. Most healthcare systems still consider body contouring to be a cosmetic procedure and are reluctant to fund such operations. This in turn has led to a number of studies addressing body contouring surgery following massive weight loss in patients who have already had bariatric surgery. The primary areas of focus of this research can be divided into two: (1) surgical outcomes in terms of procedure related complications and (2) the quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial outcome of body contouring in massive weight loss patients. In terms of procedure related complications, it has been shown that as operator experience increases, complication rates drop [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the second category of research, that is, QoL and psychosocial outcome, is far more important from a funding perspective. If we are able to demonstrate that body contouring surgery results in a significant improvement of the patient's QoL and psychosocial state, then it seizes to be viewed as a purely cosmetic procedure and may make it even obligatory for healthcare payers to fund body contouring surgery as the completion step to rehabilitating the obese patient.</p><p>The gold standard for measuring the impact of body contouring surgery on massive weight loss individuals is to use patient-specific, well-constructed psychometrically validated patient reported outcome (PRO) measures (also known as instruments). PRO instruments are any report of the status of a patient's condition that comes directly from the patient without interpretation by a surgeon or other healthcare professional [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These measures usually consist of a number of sections which are designed to include key aspects of a conceptual framework. The conceptual framework explicitly defines the concepts measured by the instrument in a diagram that presents a description of the relationships between items, domain (subconcepts), and concepts measured and the scores produced by a PRO instrument [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </p><p> A systematic review of PRO instruments to measure quality of life and patient satisfaction following body contouring surgery was undertaken by Reavey et al. They identified five PRO measures with varying psychometric validity: one general plastic surgery (DAS 59), three breast reduction (BRASSQ, BRS, Breast-Q), and one liposuction instrument (FQAD). Following this, Reavey et al. called for the development of new PRO measures specific to this population [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The development of PRO measures consists of a thorough review of currently available literature, qualitative patient interviews to determine what patients consider most important, and expert opinion [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A comprehensive understanding of issues that are critical to patients can be obtained from these three sources of information which may then help to inform development of scales and items for inclusion in a new PRO instrument. The aim of this study is to review the methods of assessing QoL and patient satisfaction in postbody contouring MWL patients. This would enable us to delineate what measures have already been employed to assess QoL and patient satisfaction in this domain and where improvements are necessary. It is hoped that by doing so, we would be fulfilling another step toward developing new specific PRO instruments for this fast growing population of patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><p>An attempt was made to make the search for the literature as systematic as possible. Hence, the PRISMA statement for systematic reviews was adhered to [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Items 12&#x02013;16 of the PRISMA statement were not applicable to this study as it was not possible to undertake quantitative data synthesis due to wide heterogeneity in the reported outcome measures.</p><p> The predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review were used to determine eligibility of a study to be included in the review.</p><p>Inclusion criteria include the following:<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>the study population was restricted to massive weight loss patients;</p></list-item><list-item><p>patients included in the study had either one or more of what is considered a body contouring procedure (e.g., abdominoplasty, panniculectomy, thoracoplasty, brachioplasty, mastopexy/plasty, thigh lift, etc.);</p></list-item><list-item><p>a clearly defined method of measuring improvement in quality of life and/or psychosocial function;</p></list-item><list-item><p>english language publication.</p></list-item></list>

</p><p>The literature search was then carried out on Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane databases from inception till March 2013 for studies on the topic of improvement in quality of life and psychosocial function following body contouring surgery in massive weight loss patients. The keywords used are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The terms in each column were combined with the Boolean operator &#x0201c;OR&#x0201d; while terms between columns were combined with &#x0201c;AND.&#x0201d; The output was limited to citations in the English language. Reference lists of identified studies were then hand searched for additional reports.</p><p>The title and abstract of all identified studies were examined. In cases where suitability of a study for inclusion in the review was unclear, the entire paper was obtained and assessed for suitability.

</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>The search retrieved a total of 89 studies. Following removal of duplicates, 45 studies remained. 25 studies were excluded following screening of the title and abstract. The entire papers of the remaining 20 articles were reviewed to establish suitability for inclusion. 11 studies were excluded as they did not meet the eligibility criteria leaving 9 studies for inclusion. The reference lists of these 9 studies were then hand searched to identify any further studies. Two studies were identified in this manner, resulting in a total of 11 studies for inclusion in the review.

Lazer et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</title><p>Two questionnaires that had been designed specifically for the study yet had not been validated were administered to 41 patients.

</p><p>The second tool was a nine-item questionnaire designed by a trained psychologist to assess psychological status. The questions in this tool were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How do you feel today?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is your opinion of your abdominoplasty?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are the results in accordance with your expectations?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are the scars a problem for you?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do you like your new body?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do other people regard you differently now?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Has your daily life improved?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What if abdominoplasty had been contraindicated?</p></list-item><list-item><p>If you had to do it over again, would you undergo abdominoplasty?</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The first questionnaire was administered once to assess preabdominoplasty body perception and QoL and for a second time to assess postbody contouring perception of improvement. The second tool was administered once to assess psychological status with all data being collected after an average follow-up period of 57.7 months (range 41 to 80 months).</p><p>In terms of the 5 areas of QoL assessed, aesthetics was the primary area of concern with 38 patients stating that they considered the abdomen an area of concern affecting their QoL prior to abdominoplasty. The next most concerning areas in terms of QoL were psychological status (36), dressing (33), sexual relations (27), and current life (15). After abdominoplasty, patients evaluated their QoL as good or very good in all of the above domains.</p><p>The second tool to assess psychological status following abdominoplasty again seemed to suggest that abdominoplasty did have a positive impact on their psychological status with 84.6% saying their daily life improved following the procedure.

Thirty-nine patients (82%) answered &#x0201c;Yes&#x0201d; when asked whether plastic surgery after weight reduction had improved their self-esteem. Thirty-four patients (72%) stated that the body contouring surgery did not provide an incentive to maintain their weight reduction goal. Thus this study showed that self-esteem in massive weight loss patients could be improved by body contouring surgery but did not affect long-term weight maintenance which may require behaviour modification through the team efforts of a weight reduction counselor, therapist, and surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>3.7.

In an ideal setting, each PRO instrument would have been validated for every category mentioned above. This would ensure that the instrument measures what it was designed for with a high degree of accuracy. However, this is not always possible or necessary. As long as content validity, construct validity, and predictive validity are satisfactory, the instrument could potentially provide accurate measures of the concept of interest. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab15">Table 15</xref> shows that most studies used psychometrically validated instruments while some used measures that were nonpsychometrically validated. A detailed discussion of the psychometric properties of each of the measures employed by the different studies is beyond the scope of this review. However, an important point of note is that all psychometric measures employed by the different studies were not developed to provide outcomes in postbody contouring surgery patients. In other words, none of the psychometrically validated instruments employed within the studies reviewed were developed specifically for the population of interest, that is, postmassive weight loss body contouring surgery patients. Hence, from the outset, content validity of the PRO instruments used is breached. This makes the QoL outcomes obtained from these instruments (in postmassive weight loss body contouring surgery patients) questionable. As a result, this review has identified the need for condition-specific outcome measures. Furthermore, certain studies modified the psychometrically validated measures used. It is hard to predict the impact of modification on each particular instrument, but taking into consideration the type and extent of modification mentioned in each study report, it would be reasonable to assume that the modification may have led to a slight improvement in the validity of the instrument. This is because they were modified to take into account the population of interest, that is, to improve construct validity. For example, the modifications made to the original Derriford appearance scale, a validated outcome instrument, used by Menderes et al. were modified taking into account local norms and patient participation. It is less likely, but not impossible, that the modification might have negatively impacted the validity.</p><p>Squires et al. present an advanced protocol for the psychometric assessment of instruments based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Validity, reliability, and acceptability are all assessed. A unitary approach to validity consisting of accumulating evidence based on instrument content, response processes, internal structure, and relations to other variables is taken while reliability is assessed with internal consistency coefficients and information functions. Acceptability of the instrument is assessed with missing data frequencies and the time required to complete the survey. Apart from this &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; method of assessing psychometric properties, other more modern methods of psychometric assessment have been developed, most useful of which is the Rasch model analysis which was developed by Rasch [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Rasch model analysis provides psychometric information that is not provided with the above mentioned more traditional analyses. Rasch model analysis is a probability model that converts the ordinal scores obtained by summing item scores into interval measures [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While the ordinal raw scores used in traditional analyses are typically used as if they were interval in nature, the measures produced by Rasch analysis are on an equal-interval scale that is common to both persons and items. <italic>Rasch analysis uses these equal-interval measures to assess multiple psychometric characteristics specific to the population for which the PRO instrument is being developed. This enables the design of PRO instruments which are more accurate and sensitive to clinical changes. </italic>
</p><p>All measures used were patient reported as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab15">Table 15</xref>. The advantage of patient reported measures includes the fact that the individual who was subjected to the intervention who should theoretically have most insight into the impact of the intervention provides the outcome. In addition, in a more general sense, it enables healthcare payers to appreciate the views of patients on particular interventions and may provide a less biased perspective to a particular treatment option. Hence, patient reported outcomes may have more weight when healthcare payers decide to fund a particular procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>As mentioned above, a systematic review of PRO instruments to measure quality of life and patient satisfaction following body contouring surgery identified five PRO measures with varying psychometric validity. However, it must be pointed out that none of these measures have been specifically developed for body contouring surgery patients, and hence the title of the study is a misnomer to its content. Reavey et al. conclude that there is a need to develop specific PRO measures for this group of patients. This review has found a number of studies which have attempted to assess QoL and patient satisfaction in postbody contouring massive weight loss patients with less than ideal PRO measures. Hence, the author agrees that there is an urgent need to develop specific and well constructed PRO instruments in order to obtain reliable information regarding QoL and patient satisfaction following body contouring surgery in MWL patients. Furthermore, future investigators should use newer techniques of assessing psychometric validity of newly developed instruments which are both more convenient and reliable compared to more traditional techniques. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>There is no conflict of interests to declare.</p></ack><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The author would like to thank Ian Wilkes, Pauline Kewell, and the rest of the staff at the Warner Library for their assistance in obtaining papers for this review.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sarwer</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Fabricatore</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Psychiatric considerations of the massive weight loss patient</article-title><source><italic>Clinics in Plastic Surgery</italic></source><year>2008</year><volume>35</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-36549054026</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18061795</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Psychological considerations of the massive weight loss patient</article-title><source><italic>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</italic></source><year>2006</year><volume>117</volume><issue>supplement 1</issue><fpage>17S</fpage><lpage>21S</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16397437</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chandawarkar</surname><given-names>RY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Body contouring following massive weight loss resulting from bariatric surgery</article-title><source><italic>Advances in Psychosomatic Medicine</italic></source><year>2006</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>61</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-33644625256</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16418543</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hafner</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Watts</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Quality of life after gastric bypass for morbid obesity</article-title><source><italic>International Journal of Obesity</italic></source><year>1991</year><volume>15</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>555</fpage><lpage>560</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-0026403568</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1938099</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hensel</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lehman</surname><given-names>JA</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name><name><surname>Tantri</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Topham</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An outcomes analysis and satisfaction survey of 199 consecutive abdominoplasties</article-title><source><italic>Annals of Plastic Surgery</italic></source><year>2001</year><volume>46</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>357</fpage><lpage>363</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-0035049844</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11324875</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Van Huizum</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Roche</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofer</surname><given-names>SOP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Circular belt lipectomy: a retrospective follow-up study on perioperative complications and cosmetic outcome</article-title><source><italic>Annals of Plastic Surgery</italic></source><year>2005</year><volume>54</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>459</fpage><lpage>464</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-17644380254</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15838202</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="other"><comment>U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
