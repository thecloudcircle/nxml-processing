It remains the most significant parasitic disease in the tropics where it causes ~200 million clinical cases and is reported to claim up to 1.2 million lives each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Substantial efforts are being made to not only reduce the number of clinical manifestations and deaths attributed to malaria, but also to the complete eradication of this disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) first attempted a global eradication programme during the period 1955&#x02013;1969, which was ultimately unsuccessful. A recent review of the 1955&#x02013;1969 campaign points to the lack of suitability of the control measures taken at that time for all areas involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Some countries were highly successful in achieving eradication, whereas in others any headway made was lost to subsequent resurgence of malaria, often in epidemic proportions. International aid for continued malaria control in endemic malaria regions declined considerably during the 1970&#x02019;s and 1980&#x02019;s, however recent renewed international efforts into malaria control and research has resulted in promising advances in new control measures.</p><p>Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) has proven to be the most effective anti-malarial for both treatment and control to date, with the additional benefit of significantly impacting on the reduction in malaria transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In 2007, a renewed effort for global eradication of malaria was proposed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) at the 2007 Malaria Forum in Seattle, Washington [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In 2011, scientists reconvened in Bethesda, to discuss the latest research and developments into the sexual development of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and the latest strategies for malarial control. One of the key deliverables identified from this meeting was the need for phenotypic assays for the identification of compounds which kill gametocytes and ookinetes, and hence may ultimately function as transmission blocking drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Gametocytes arise through a switch from asexual replication in the human host to sexual forms of the parasite in a process termed gametocytogenesis. During intra-erythrocytic asexual replication, the stage of the parasite life cycle responsible for the clinical symptoms of malaria, limited numbers of the parasite undergo conversion to the sexual form. This sexual differentiation appears to be triggered and, or controlled by a number of environmental, parasite and host defined mechanisms which are still not clearly defined. Several of these putative gametocytogenesis inducing factors have been recently reviewed by Lucantoni &#x00026; Avery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Gametocytes remain in human host erythrocytes throughout this conversion and during the prolonged 10&#x02013;12&#x000a0;day maturation period. Initially, gametocytes are difficult to differentiate from asexual ring and early trophozoite stages by standard Giemsa-stained blood smears. The gametocytes undergo further development, which is classified into five distinct morphological stages, termed I to V. The gametocytes continue a morphological and biochemical development from an early stage or immature (I-III) to a late stage or mature (IV and V) gametocyte. Only the fully developed, mature stage V gametocytes, can survive in the mosquito gut environment where the male and female gametes generated undergo fertilization with the formation of ookinetes, perpetuating the transmission cycle from human host through mosquito vector, and back to the human host.</p><p>A number of large-scale high throughput screening (HTS) campaigns have been performed over the last five years to identify compounds with activity against the asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Notably, 309,474 compounds by St. Jude Children&#x02019;s Research Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], 2 million by GlaxoSmithKline Tres Cantos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and 1.7 million by Novartis-GNF (Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were screened. The not-for-profit organization, Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) has also been instrumental in obtaining numerous proprietary chemical libraries from both the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for testing for anti-malarial activity. The screening of these has been undertaken predominantly as a joint venture between MMV and the Eskitis Institute for Drug Discovery, at Griffith University. The collective outcomes of these screening campaigns have resulted in the public availability of data for numerous sets of compounds with asexual anti-malarial activity. The total number of asexual active compounds identified through the aforementioned activities exceeds 25,000. These asexually active compounds have formed the basis of screening activities to identify molecules with dual activity against both the asexual and sexual stages, in a bid to identify molecules with the capability of not only treating the clinical symptoms, but also with the added ability to block transmission.</p><p>In order to identify dual acting compounds against asexual and gametocyte stages, we have developed a large-scale, high-yielding, reproducible gametocyte induction protocol, which provides sufficient gametocytes in the quantity and quality required to develop HTS assays for both early (I-III) and late (IV-V) stage gametocytes. Both assays, utilize high throughput confocal microscopy, with automated image analysis for detection and quantification of compound activity against gametocytes. To validate and demonstrate the capability of these assays to identify compounds with activity against early and late stage gametocytes, 36 compounds used as asexual anti-malarials, in addition to compounds currently in preclinical development were tested, and their IC<sub>50</sub> values against both early and late stage gametocytes determined. The activity of these compounds against the asexual forms of the parasite in an image-based assay was also confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The MMV malaria box was subsequently screened for activity against both early and late stage gametocytes in HTS format and active compounds further characterized by determining their IC<sub>50</sub> values. The MMV malaria box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] is comprised of compounds which were identified as asexual actives from the Novartis-GNF, St Jude Children&#x02019;s research hospital, and the GSK-Tres Cantos (TCAMS) active compound sets, as well as from the screening of commercial libraries. Two hundred compounds within the MMV malaria box are considered to be drug-like and 200 probe-like, which may be considered as a representative subset of the 25,000 asexual active compounds identified over <italic>the last 5&#x000a0;years.</italic></p><p>Herein, the first ever comprehensive published data for anti-malarial compounds with activity against both early (I-III) and late (IV-V) stage gametocytes is described. The same gametocyte strain, induction protocol and assay technology has been utilized to provide this data enabling a direct comparison of the results obtained. Also included is the first gametocyte specific data presented for the MMV malaria box with a complete data set in IC<sub>50</sub> format for activity against both early and late stage gametocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Asexual culture</title><p>Asexual culture was performed using standard culturing techniques as first described by Trager and Jensen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Specifically, the asexual culture media contained RPMI with 10&#x000a0;mM Hepes (Invitrogen, Australia), 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml hypoxanthine, 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml blasticidin (for transgenic selection of NF54-pfs16-GFP), 5% pooled human AB male serum (Sigma, Australia) and 2.5&#x000a0;mg/ml AlbuMAX II&#x000ae; (Invitrogen, Australia). The parasites were maintained at 0.5-4% parasitaemia (%P) at 5% haematocrit (%H). Human O + erythrocytes were obtained from the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (Agreement No: 09-05QLD-06). Human ethics approval was given by the Griffith University Human Ethics Committee for the handling and use of human red blood cells for parasite culture and experiments performed within this study (ESK/03/12/HREC and ESK/03/07/HREC). The culture was adjusted daily to maintain low parasitaemia. All parasite incubations for both culture maintenance and assay were performed at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub> and 60% humidity.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> 3D7 asexual assay</title><p>The asexual parasite culture and assay was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] with only the single modification of using 5% serum and 2.5&#x000a0;mg/ml AlbuMAX II&#x000ae; in combination rather than 5&#x000a0;mg/ml AlbuMAX II&#x000ae; without serum. In brief, strain 3D7 of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> was synchronized to early trophozoite (&#x02018;ring&#x02019;) stage parasites using sorbitol selective lysis as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. On the day of the assay compounds were diluted in water and 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l added to PerkinElmer CellCarrier imaging plates. Twenty-five &#x003bc;l of asexual assay media was added to all wells followed by 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of parasite culture at 2% P and 0.75% H, resulting in a final %H of 0.3%. Plates were incubated for 72&#x000a0;hours in standard conditions then stained with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The plates were left for at least 4&#x000a0;hours before imaging on the Opera QEHS microplate confocal imaging system (PerkinElmer, Australia). DNA spot analysis was performed and the number of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) provided as the output. The OPERA output was defined as the number of classified spots per imaged area and was calculated as % inhibition based on 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M artemisinin (positive) and 0.4% DMSO (negative) controls. IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined using Prizm 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Gametocyte induction, culture and isolation</title><p>NF54 transgenic parasite expressing GFP linked to luciferase under the control of the early gametocyte specific pfs16 promoter, Pfs16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] were generously provided by Prof David Fidock, Columbia University, NY and maintained in asexual culture as described above. At Day &#x02212;3 of the induction protocol, mid stage trophozoite parasites were isolated on a CS magnetic column (MACS) and VarioMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec, Australia). Fresh non-infected red blood cells (RBCs) were added to the isolated trophozoites, and the haematocrit reduced to 1.25%. After overnight shaking, the Day &#x02212;2 culture was then put under nutritional stress overnight. Resulting trophozoite parasites, Day &#x02212;1, were then adjusted to 3% P and shaken overnight before removal of spontaneously generated gametocytes using MACS column gametocyte depletion on Day 0. Ring stage parasites were then transferred into gametocyte culture media which was the same as the asexual media with the addition of 50&#x000a0;mM&#x000a0;N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) for removal of asexual parasites.</p></sec><sec><title>Post induction, culture and isolation of gametocytes for the early (I-III) stage assay</title><p>Day 0 ring stage parasites, post spontaneous gametocyte removal, were centrifuged and suspended in asexual media. The ring stage parasites were split to 4% P and the %H maintained at 2.5%. The culture was left overnight to incubate. The following day (Day1 post-induction) fresh media was added to the mid trophozoite stage culture by simple aspiration and replacement and the culture incubated overnight. After overnight incubation the non-committed asexual parasites were again at ring stage, however, the committed gametocytes were now similar to young trophozoite stages and contained haemozoin. The gametocytes were isolated using the MAC isolation procedure. Twenty &#x003bc;l of non-infected compacted RBCs were added per isolated gametocyte column run (10 ml/run) resulting in a final haematocrit of between 0.2 and 0.5% H. Determination of % gametocytes was made by both Giemsa-staining and GFP fluorescence microscopy. Gametocytes isolated in this manner were typically stage I/IIa. In preparation for use in the early stage assay, these I/IIa gametocytes were diluted to 10%P in 0.1% H in media containing NAG.</p></sec><sec><title>Post induction culture and isolation of gametocytes for the late (IV-V) stage assay</title><p>The Day 0 ring parasites were placed in media containing 50&#x000a0;mM NAG at 2.5% H, and 50&#x000a0;ml of culture was placed in 100&#x000a0;mm diameter large Petri dishes. Thirty-five ml of spent media was replaced daily over 7 successive days for each culture dish. On Day 8 the gametocytes were harvested using magnetic columns and RBCs added to the isolated gametocytes. The final isolated gametocytes and RBCs were then counted on a haemocytometer, and the culture adjusted to 10% gametocytes in a total of 0.1% H in media containing 50&#x000a0;mM NAG.</p></sec><sec><title>Early gametocyte (stage I-III) assay protocol</title><p>Five &#x003bc;l of diluted compound in 4% DMSO was transferred in 384-well format into PerkinElmer Cell carrier Poly-D-Lysine imaging plates using a Minitrack&#x02122; liquid handler (CCS Packard).

First, the GFP intensity was measured and distribution determined with an exposure time of 400&#x000a0;msec (488&#x000a0;nm), then to ascertain the fluorescence intensity of the viability stain, MTR, measurements were made for 600&#x000a0;msec (532&#x000a0;nm). Autofocus from the first well was used to correct for the subsequent well images. All images, for each well, were analysed by the Acapella based script and stored directly into a database as imaged. The script has been optimized to select objects with a MTR fluorescent signal above an assay specified cut-off and a GFP object morphology which was longer than it was wider, specifically the object was elongated (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A).

The in-plate controls (comprised of 16 wells of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M puromycin as the positive control and 16 wells of 0.4% DMSO as the negative control) for 25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;384-well plates tested to obtain accurate IC<sub>50</sub> values, for early and late stage gametocyte, are presented in Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B. The average signal: background values were 13.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.5 (SD) and 6.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.76 (SD) for early and late, respectively, with Z&#x02019; values of 0.68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1(SD) and 0.53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08 (SD), respectively. The performance of the assays was highly stable from the first to last plates with good reproducibility within a single plate. Unfortunately, IC<sub>50</sub> values for 25 of these compounds could not be determined for either early and/or late stage assays due to low activity or an inability to generate suitable curves. Many of the compounds were also shown to be insoluble in water and thus the necessary dilution of DMSO for performing the assay was limiting.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>In plate control data for early (I-III) and late (IV-V) stage gametocyte assays.</bold> In-plate control data obtained during screening of the MMV malaria box against <bold>A</bold>. early (I-III) and <bold>B</bold>. late (IV-V) stage gametocytes is shown.

Of the 20 &#x02018;drug-like&#x02019; active compounds, 7 (35%) were active against both early and late stage gametocytes, 9 (45%) were active against late stage gametocytes only and 4 (20%) were classified as active against early gametocytes only. When considering the degree of activity against the asexual parasite for the 200 &#x02018;drug-like&#x02019; compounds in comparison to the late stage gametocyte activity, only 14 (7%) had activity with less than fivefold difference in IC<sub>50</sub> values, indicating equipotent activities between asexual and late gametocyte stages. One compound in particular, MMV666693, although very active against the 3D7 asexual parasite (23.8&#x000a0;nM) was 18.4 times less active against the late stage gametocyte and not active against the early stage gametocytes at all. As late stage gametocyte activity equal to or better than asexual activity is widely considered to be essential for potential transmission blocking drugs, then only 7% (14/200) of the asexual active &#x02018;drug-like&#x02019; compounds within the MMV malaria box would be selected for progression on this basis. Of particular note are MMV019918 and MMV07907 which have IC<sub>50</sub> values &#x0003c;1,000&#x000a0;nM against all three stages tested (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B and C).</p><p>Of the 200 &#x02018;probe-like&#x02019; compounds tested, 52 (26%) gave an IC<sub>50</sub> value for either early, late or both gametocyte stages &#x02264;1600&#x000a0;nM and were classified as actives (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Of these 52 &#x02018;probe-like&#x02019; compounds 16 (31%) demonstrated activity against both early and late stage gametocytes, 32 (61%) showed late stage activity only whilst only 5 (9.6%) of the 52 probes exhibited activity for early stage gametocytes only. Of the 200 &#x0201c;probe-like&#x0201d; compounds, 41 (21%) with late stage activity had less than a five-fold reduced activity against late stage gametocytes in comparison to the asexual activity. This is significantly higher than that for &#x0201c;drug- like&#x0201d; compounds (7%). It would, therefore, appear that the &#x02018;probe-like&#x02019; compounds within the collection have a higher hit-rate on these gametocyte assays than the &#x02018;drug-like&#x02019; compounds (26% &#x0201c;probe-like&#x0201d; late stage gametocyte active in comparison to 10% &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; late stage gametocyte active), Additionally, in general the more &#x0201c;probe-like&#x0201d; compounds have comparable asexual and late stage gametocyte activity than the &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; compounds.

With the specifically optimized synchronous gametocyte induction and isolation protocol described above, quantities of gametocytes sufficient for 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;384-well imaging plates (almost 20,000 data points) were able to be produced two to three times per week. The assays described here were able to detect compounds which prevented the development of gametocytes from stage I to stage III or kill stage IV/V gametocytes.</p><p>The linearity calibration conducted during the validation of this assay showed a linear relationship between actual number of gametocytes added per well, as defined by the use of a haemocytometer, and those gametocytes identified per imaged area within a well using the automated image analysis algorithm. Using 33,000 gametocytes per well (384-well plate) in a HTS assay format, an average signal to background (S:B) ratio of 13.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.5, 6.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.76 (SD) and a Z&#x02019; of 0.68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1, 0.53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08 (SD) for the early and late stage gametocyte assays, respectively were obtained. This data was generated for a screening run of 25 assay plates in 384-well formats, which translates to 9,600 data points.</p><p>Several laboratories have developed assays to measure compound activity against late stage gametocytes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly compare these assays and associated compound activities with one another as the same compounds have not been screened in all cases. In some instances IC<sub>50</sub> values have been determined, whereas in others only the % inhibitions at a specific single concentration have been indicated. In addition, the various assays employ different gametocyte induction protocols and parasite strains, isolation protocols, gametocyte densities per well, the presence or absence of RBCs, compound incubation times and media components, as well as methods for detection, which may all have some effect on the results obtained. It is therefore only possible to perform a limited comparison between the compound activities determined by the different assays. Thus, the interpretation of the observed differences and similarities, and resultant implications must be treated with caution. For example two independent laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have developed late stage gametocyte assays, both using ATP bioluminescence as the measure of parasite viability, and screened some, if not all of the 36 current anti-malarials described here. Although the same thirteen compounds were tested by both groups, one performed IC<sub>50</sub> values directly whilst the other screened at 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M first to select actives. Three compounds have IC<sub>50</sub> data presented in both publications, which are methylene blue 490&#x000a0;nM and 12&#x000a0;nM, artesunate 10.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and 2.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and pyronaridine 3.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and 0.28&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M. Although the detection method was based on the same technology, incubation times and gametocyte numbers per well were different and may provide the explanation for the variations observed. An assay based on the gametocyte specific NF54-mal8p 1.16- luciferase transgenic parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] has also been use to test activity of a selection of anti-malarial drugs. Activity was expressed in % activity ranges for fixed compound doses related to asexual determined IC<sub>50</sub> values. DHA was demonstrated to result in 50-75% inhibition of late stage gametocytes at a fixed dose of 120&#x000a0;nM in comparison to less than 50% inhibition for 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M or 3.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M obtained by ATP bioluminescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Methylene blue exhibited &#x0003e;75% inhibition at 150&#x000a0;nM, which is comparable to the data reported for the ATP Bioluminescence assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. An assay based on lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) detection, where parasite LDH has higher activity than that of RBCs, was recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This assay is undertaken in two formats, one for 72&#x000a0;hours with the drug in contact with the gametocytes and one where the drug is removed after 72&#x000a0;hours exposure and the plates incubated for a further 72&#x000a0;hours. DHA and methylene blue were both recorded as having activity &#x0003e;400&#x000a0;nM at 72&#x000a0;hours, and 17 and 29&#x000a0;nM, respectively after a further 72&#x000a0;hours of incubation in the absence of drug. This group also tested the non-specific compound, epoxomicin, for which an extended incubation format resulted in an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.9&#x000a0;nM. Epoxomicin was also tested in an ATP bioluminescence assay and gave an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.42&#x000a0;nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Yet another late stage gametocyte assay using the oxido-reduction indicator Alamar blue has been published which also tested epoxomicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] generating an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.4&#x000a0;nM. This compound has been tested in the late stage (IV-V) gametocyte imaging assay described here resulting in an average IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.66&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.26&#x000a0;nM over 19 experiments. Notably, this compound, whilst non-specific for the malaria parasite when tested in four different assays, has the most consistent result compared with any other compound tested. Specific anti-malarial compounds have somewhat of a more variable result within the assays reviewed. When comparing the data obtained from the imaging assays described here for known anti-malarial compounds some significant differences and similarities with those presented within the published literature are seen. In general major differences have been observed between results obtained for the endoperoxides.</p><p>Although previously it has been widely accepted, or at least predicted, that these compounds are not, or will not be active against late stage gametocytes, in fact all members of this class of compounds result in the death of late stage gametocytes in the assays described here. Artesunate has an average IC<sub>50</sub> value of 3&#x000a0;nM against late stage gametocytes as determined using the imaging assay. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> shows the IC<sub>50</sub> plot for artesunate and the number of viable elongated gametocytes identified decreasing with increasing compound concentration. The parasites within the wells can clearly be seen to have lost MTR staining with complete disruption of gametocyte structure at 50&#x000a0;nM dosing. This is comparable to the effect observed for the GFP-MTR overlay for the 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M puromycin control in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Images with masked viable elongated gametocytes treated with five concentrations of artesunate.</bold> Representative images of the impact of increasing concentrations of artesunate on late stage (IV-V) gametocytes.

Two assays, both using ATP bioluminescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], demonstrate low &#x003bc;M activity of endoperoxides against late stage gametocytes. From a literature search, other publications which tested the endoperoxides directly on late stage gametocytes in micro-titre plate HTS assays were not identified. However, other independent laboratories have used endoperoxides as controls for anti-gametocyte activity testing using more traditional Giemsa smears and microscopy, reporting an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 108&#x000a0;nM for artesunate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The data generated for the endoperoxides within these image based assays clearly show equipotent activity against asexual, early and late stage gametocytes which has previously never been demonstrated. This is a vital piece of information for interpreting field based studies on transmission rates and transmission blockage. Although numerous reports of reduced transmission rates with ACT are presented, the rational for the effect has been predominantly based on the belief that the action is due to the extremely fast clearance of asexual parasites, and action specifically against young sequestered gametocytes. However, the data presented here would indicate that the action could also be against more mature forms of gametocytes released into the circulation.</p><p>Some advantages of the image based gametocyte assays are, the same gametocytes, reagents and technology are used for both early and late stage assays and hence the data can be compared directly. The confocal fluorescent microscopy output is a direct measurement of compound effect on individual gametocytes and not the contents of a well in total. The Pfs16-GFP and MTR signal are both specific to the gametocyte as erythrocytes do not express Pfs16 or have mitochondria to convert the MTR viability marker. Hence the host RBC has no direct impact on the assay output.</p><p>With this comprehensive evaluation and validation of compound activity against both early and late stage gametocytes for current anti-malarial drugs, a benchmark for comparison of unknown compounds was established. The MMV malaria box, provided a starting point for the search for compounds with activity against the asexual parasite and also against both early and late stage gametocytes. Compounds with activity against both early and late stage gametocytes were equally distributed through the &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; (35%) and &#x0201c;probe-like&#x0201d; (31%) compounds within the MMV malaria box. However, the &#x0201c;probe-like&#x0201d; compounds resulted in a 16% higher hit rate for late stage gametocytes than the &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; compounds, whereas the reverse was true for the early stage gametocytes, with twice the number of the &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; compounds being actives. The &#x0201c;probe-like&#x0201d; compounds also have three times the number of compounds demonstrating asexual and late stage gametocyte activity at less than a five-fold difference and hence, considered to be equipotent against both the asexual blood stage parasites and late stage gametocytes. Of particular note are MMV007907 and MMV019918 which have IC<sub>50</sub> values &#x0003c;&#x02009;1000&#x000a0;nM against all three stages tested (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B and C). These compounds fall into the &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; classification given to the MMV malaria box compounds. Having biological activity against the asexual blood stages, early and late stage gametocytes, in addition to their &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; chemical characteristics have ear-marked these compounds for further investigation.</p><p>It could be interpreted from the data that compounds with the classified &#x0201c;drug like&#x0201d; properties are less likely to be equipotent against late stage gametocytes and the asexual blood stage parasites. However, this is a small compound subset and the exact breakdown of the &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;probe-like&#x0201d; actives has not been considered in this instance. Based on this data it could be extrapolated that only 14% of the compounds identified as asexually active, irrespective of &#x0201c;drug-like&#x0201d; status, would potentially result in compounds with equipotent activity against asexual blood stage parasites and late stage gametocytes. This is not taking into consideration the activity against early stage gametocytes, which makes the number of total compounds with equipotent activity less.</p><p>Hence, 14% of 25,000 asexual actives could potentially yield 3,500 chemical starting points. It must be noted that activity against early or late stage gametocytes does not guarantee that a compound will have transmission-blocking ability in the field or indeed within <italic>in vivo</italic> models. The outcome of these HTS assays is the identification of compounds with activity against gametocytes. With the HTS capacity of the assays described, hundreds of thousands of compounds can be screened for anti-gametocyte activity, enriching the potential compound sets for testing in lower throughput <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> transmission blocking assays. Essentially, having more chemical starting points to screen in transmission blocking <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays should ultimately increase the odds of finding a compound capable of transmission blockage.</p><p>A new lead compound, ELQ-300 (Quinolone-3-diarylether) has demonstrated significant <italic>in vivo</italic> transmission blocking potential in mouse models of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This compound was tested using this late stage gametocyte imaging assay and has an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 71.9&#x000a0;nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] indicating the late stage gametocyte assay as having the ability to identify compounds with transmission blocking potential. The testing of asexual active compounds against gametocytes is an obvious starting point to search for compounds active against gametocytes (25,000 in total), however the alternative approach is to screen whole libraries for compounds active against late stage gametocytes. This late stage gametocyte assay is fully capable of screening compounds in true HTS format, namely the screening of hundreds of thousands of compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The development of two image based assays for determining activity against early and late stage gametocytes has enabled a comprehensive examination of gametocyte stage specific activity for current anti-malarial drugs and identification of potential new anti-malarial chemical starting points. The same parasite and gametocyte induction protocol, as well as the same technology was used for both early and late assays allowing for a direct comparison of compound activity. To enable direct comparison with the asexual activities the gametocyte numbers used in the assays were adjusted to be similar to the asexual image based assay. Ultimately, a panel of assays, directly comparing asexual, early and late stage gametocyte activity in comparative conditions has been established. The data for in-plate controls, signal to background and Z&#x02019; demonstrate the stability of the gametocyte assays over 25 individual 384-well assay plates screened as a single screening campaign. This is equivalent to 9,600 data points per assay. Not only has activity for a range of current anti-malarials and activity for unknowns been identified, the suitability of these gametocyte imaging assays to be performed in true HTS mode has been demonstrated. It is believed this is the first HTS screening data presented for comparison of activity against early stage (I-III) and, of particular importance, late stage (IV-V) gametocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SD designed and performed the experimental research, SD analysed data and wrote the paper, VMA designed the research, analysed data and contributed to writing the paper.
