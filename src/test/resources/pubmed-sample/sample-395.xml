In order to reveal the mechanisms underlying these paternal effects, we have assessed X chromosome meiotic compaction, XY chromosome aneuploidy rates and global transcription in meiotic and haploid germ cells from male mice heterozygous for <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>. XY bodies from <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males were significantly longer than those from wild types, and were associated with a three-fold increase in XY bearing sperm. Loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele resulted in deregulated expression of a large number of both X-linked and autosomal genes within meiotic cells, but more prominently in haploid germ cells. Data demonstrate that similar to embryonic stem cells, DNMT3L is involved in an auto-regulatory loop in germ cells wherein the loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele resulted in increased transcription from the remaining wild type allele. In contrast, however, within round spermatids, this auto-regulatory loop incorporated the alternative non-coding alternative transcripts. Consistent with the mRNA data, we have localized DNMT3L within spermatids and sperm and shown that the loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele results in a decreased DNMT3L content within sperm. These data demonstrate previously unrecognised roles for DNMT3L in late meiosis and in the transcriptional regulation of meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells. These data provide a potential mechanism for some cases of human Klinefelter's and Turner's syndromes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility affects 1 in 20 men in the Western world. Increasingly data is showing that in addition to genetic changes, aberrant epigenetic regulation during spermatogenesis can lead to human infertility <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hammoud1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0018276-Marques1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Previous studies on the epigenetic regulator DNMT3L, have shown that deletion of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> in mice resulted in hypomethylation of paternally imprinted regions and transposable elements in gonocytes, as well as developmental arrest and death of early meiotic cells <xref rid="pone.0018276-Bourchis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0018276-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Consequently <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> knockout males were sterile.</p><p>
<italic>Dnmt3L</italic> mRNA and protein were originally reported only in the primordial germ cells, where DNMT3L is needed to establish epigenetic marks required in early primary spermatocytes <xref rid="pone.0018276-Bourchis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Subsequently, it was shown that <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> mRNA was present in spermatocytes and spermatids <xref rid="pone.0018276-LaSalle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hata1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, it was shown that a second promoter in intron 9 initiates three alternative transcripts (Forms 1, 2 and 3) in late pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids <xref rid="pone.0018276-Shovlin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. While the function of the alternative isoforms is unknown, they are thought to be non-coding and to suppress translation of the full length <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> isoform <xref rid="pone.0018276-Shovlin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The localization of DNMT3L protein within the adult testis or sperm has not been reported.</p><p>
<italic>Dnmt3L</italic> was recently reported as the first example of a mammalian paternal effect gene <xref rid="pone.0018276-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Animals with mutations in such genes are of particular interest as they exhibit a male heterozygous phenotype, that can affect the phenotype of their wild type progeny. Specifically, when <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males were mated to wild type females, there was an increased incidence of XO monosomy in wild type E10.5 embryos and adults compared to wild type matings <xref rid="pone.0018276-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These data suggested that the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males may have a meiotic defect related to X and Y chromosome segregation and encouraged us to study the effects of the loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele in germ cells in more detail.</p><p>We hypothesised that decreased availability of DNMT3L in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males may lead to the inappropriate epigenetic marking of the DNA, and a partial failure of sex chromosomes to convert from an euchromatic state to a highly condensed heterochromatic state leading to a meiotic instability. We hypothesised that if true, abnormal XY compaction would be reflected by aberrant patterns of gene expression in meiotic and haploid germ cells. To investigate these hypotheses we measured the lengths of the XY bodies in meiotic cells from heterozygous and wild type males, we defined the incidence of XY sperm aneuploidies, and monitored transcriptional activity in spermatocytes and round spermatids.</p><p>
<italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males had XY bodies which were significantly longer than those from their wild type brothers, and exhibited a significantly increased incidence of XY non-disjunction. We demonstrated that a loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele was associated with disregulation of a number of X-linked and autosomal genes in spermatocytes and spermatids. Consistent with these observations, we localized DNMT3L protein within spermatids and mature sperm. Furthermore, our data strongly suggested a complex <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> self-regulatory mechanism in germ cells similar to that previously reported in embryos and ES cells <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but additionally involving the alternative transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>

The expression of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> was normalised to the whole genome, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3 biological replicates (10 mice per replicate). (<bold>B</bold>) The <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> wildtype allele contains 13 exons. Disruption of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> was achieved through homologous recombination and resulted in the insertion of a <italic>LacZ</italic> gene within exon 5. Three stop codons and a polyadenylation signal were included after the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene. (<bold>C</bold>) The Dnmt3L-5 primer sets were located in exons 3&#x02013;4, 5&#x02032; to the insertion of the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene. The Dnmt3L-mid primer sets were located in exons 7&#x02013;8, 3&#x02032; of the insertion of the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene. The Dnmt3L-3 primer sets were located in exons 12&#x02013;13, which is common to all four <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> isoforms. A second promoter can be activated in intron 9 of the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> gene to produce a novel exon, 9b, from which transcription of the three alternative transcripts starts. Form 1 includes exon 9b and large 9c (9cL). Form 2 includes exon 9b and short 9c (9cS). Form 3 only includes exon 9b. Forms 1, 2 and 3 all contain exons 10&#x02013;13. Primers for Form 1 were located in exons 9b and 9cL. Primers for Form 2 were located in exons 9b and 9cS. Primers for Form 3 were located in exon 9b and exon 11.

Heterozygous males carry both a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> knockout and a wild type allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018276-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). It is of note, that male germ cells develop within a syncitium wherein mRNA and proteins produced in one cell can be shared across cytoplasmic bridges, meaning that although individual spermatids may have a different genotype i.e. heterozygous or wild type for <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>, they are equivalent at a protein and mRNA level <xref rid="pone.0018276-Ventela1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Form 1 contains exon 9b and a second novel exon, exon 9cL. Form 2 contains exon 9b and a shorter version of exon 9c, exon 9cS. Form 3 contains exon 9b only. All three forms contain the same exons 10, 11, 12 and 13 as in the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> full form mRNA, and were therefore detected on the microarray.</p><p>In order to assess the expression levels of individual <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> isoforms in spermatocytes and spermatids, we designed QPCR assays specific for the three alternative transcripts as well as assays to detect the 5&#x02032;, middle and 3&#x02032; regions of the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> full form transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018276-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018276.s001">Supporting Information File S1</xref>).

While the mRNA for Forms 1, 2 and 3 isoforms share significant homology with the protein coding splice variant at the level of mRNA sequence, they do not contain an open reading frame of any length and as such can not produce protein. Relative expression was measured in a minimum of three biological replicates and each replicate contained purified germ cells from 10 males.</p><p>QPCR on spermatocytes from <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous and wild type males showed that the loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele resulted in a significant up-regulation of the 5&#x02032; (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0223) and mid (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0417) regions of the full <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> transcripts in the heterozygous males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018276-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). While the up-regulation in mRNA containing the 5&#x02032; sequence could be from either the wild type or knockout allele, the up-regulation in mRNA containing the Dnmt3L-mid sequence suggested an up-regulation from the wild type allele i.e. translation from the knockout allele would be blocked by the stop codons in the <italic>LacZ</italic> cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018276-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

The XY bodies from <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males are longer than those from <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> and C57Bl/6 wild type males, and this finding supports a mechanism whereby a partial failure of chromatin compaction in the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males leads to paternal effects <xref rid="pone.0018276-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Further, our data reveals that loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele results in dysregulation of both meiotic and post-meiotic gene transcription.</p><p>It is established that much of the XY body becomes condensed and silenced during pachytene <xref rid="pone.0018276-Handel1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0018276-Baarends1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our results suggest that in the heterozygous males, the chromatin of the XY body is not condensing as tightly as in the wild type males. As a result of this, some genes that should become inactived may remain accessible for transcription. Our data shows that DNMT3L is involved in regulating some of the chromatin changes occurring on the XY body. These changes may be important for the silencing of certain genes.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that DNMT3L is essential during the early phases of male meiosis. The absence of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> results in a failure to silence retrotransposon expression in gonocytes, and a failure of homologous chromosome condensation and pairing in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes <xref rid="pone.0018276-Bourchis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The subsequent &#x0201c;meiotic catastrophe&#x0201d; is a consequence of a failure of chromosomes to progress from a euchromatic state to a heterochromatic state <xref rid="pone.0018276-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Recently it was also shown that in addition to a failure of synapsis during meiosis, <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> null males have an impairment of the meiotic silencing by unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) response. As such this resulted in a failure of XY body silencing which may contribute to the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> mutant phenotype <xref rid="pone.0018276-Mahadevaiah1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The data presented here suggest that a similar, but more subtle, mechanism is occurring on the XY bodies of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males and that this ultimately leads to a three fold increased risk of XY sperm.</p><p>Sex chromosome aneuploidies are common and potentially increasing in humans. Recent data suggest that the birth incidence of Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) is 1.09&#x02013;1.75 in 1,000 <xref rid="pone.0018276-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and 1 in 1,000 for Turner's syndrome (XO) <xref rid="pone.0018276-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It has been shown that approximately 10&#x00025; of sperm from normal healthy and fertile men have structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0018276-Guttenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>). Sperm aneuploidies almost always arise during meiosis and defective recombination between the X and Y pseudoautosomal region is believed to be the most common cause of XY sperm disomy <xref rid="pone.0018276-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hassold1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Proposed mechanisms for their aetiology include both genetic and environmental factors. Men exposed to potential mutagens, including pesticides <xref rid="pone.0018276-Padungtod1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and chemotherapy agents <xref rid="pone.0018276-Frias1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, have an increased risk of sperm aneuploidies. Similarly, sub-fertile and infertile men <xref rid="pone.0018276-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018276-Templado1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and mice <xref rid="pone.0018276-Oppedisano1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, have an increased frequency of sperm chromosomal abnormalities. The data contained in this study demonstrates that decreased levels of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> in germ cells could lead to a significant increase in XY sperm aneuploidy and as we have shown previously, an increased frequency of XO offspring <xref rid="pone.0018276-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Studies on the parental origin of the X chromosome in Turner's syndrome patients have found that in the majority of cases the remaining X chromosome is of maternal origin i.e. the paternal X or Y chromosome is lost <xref rid="pone.0018276-Cockwell1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0018276-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, a study on fathers of Turner's syndrome patients (with a single X chromosome of maternal origin) showed that these men had an increased incidence of XY sperm, suggesting an increased frequency of non-disjunction of the X and Y chromosomes during meiosis <xref rid="pone.0018276-MartinezPasarell1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Collectively, these data raise the possibility that decreased expression of <italic>DNMT3L</italic> in humans may also lead to Klinefelter's or Turner's syndromes in some children.</p><p>The precise mechanisms leading to decreased XY body compaction are yet to be determined. It is possible that there are changes in the methylation status throughout the genome of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous germ cells compared to cells from wild type animals. Alternatively, or in addition, the aberrant expression of specific genes involved in spermatogenesis contributed to abnormalities. For example, <italic>Tsga8</italic>, which was significantly up-regulated in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous spermatocytes compared to cells from wild type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018276-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), codes for a protein involved in DNA condensation during spermatogenesis <xref rid="pone.0018276-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>As an extension of the partial failure of XY body compaction, we anticipated that <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygosity would lead to an up-regulation in the transcription of X linked genes in meiotic and potentially post-meiotic germ cells. Some support for this comes from the microarray data, however, the absolute number of differentially regulated genes was small. In contrast, <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygosity did result in a large number of autosomal genes being differentially expressed in both spermatocytes and spermatids, revealing a previously unrecognized role of DNMT3L in the regulation of autosomal gene transcription.</p><p>
<italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygosity results in both the over- and under-expression of genes. It was anticipated that DNMT3L deficiency would predominantly be associated with increased transcription as a consequence of a looser chromatin state and increased access of transcription factors to gene promoters. While this was the case for many genes, including <italic>Aire</italic> and <italic>Xrn1,</italic> some genes, including <italic>Ddx50</italic> and <italic>EPB41L2,</italic> were significantly down-regulated. While it is clear that altered DNMT3L production results in significant changes in the expression of many genes, including <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> itself, it is not as yet possible to determine whether each individual change is as a direct consequence of DNMT3L deficiency, or is secondary to changes in other epigenetic regulators or transcription factors ie. these data suggest that DNMT3L sits at the start of a cascade of gene regulation networks which ultimately impact on many aspects of a cells phenotype.</p><p>Further, our microarray data show that contrary to expectations, the overall level of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> transcript, based on a probe against exon 13, was unchanged. This prompted us to analyse <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> expression more carefully. Quantitative PCR data show that in germ cells from <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males there was up-regulated transcription of the full <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> splice variant from the remaining wild type allele, and there was increased use of an alternative promoter and transcription of mRNA species encoding the alternative <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> variants, Forms 1 and 2 in spermatids. The allele(s) from which these variants were transcribed was not analysed, however, it may have occurred from both the knockout allele and the wild type allele.</p><p>A previous study has shown that members of the DNMT3 group i.e. DNMT3L, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, can regulate methylation of the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> promoter region <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In ES cells and embryos, a deficiency in <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> resulted in hypomethylation of the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> promoter region. Similarly, a deficiency in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> resulted in hypomethylation of its own promoter. The authors proposed that the DNMT3 members are involved in an auto-repression mechanism, whereby if methyltransferase activity is reduced, increased transcription of <italic>Dnmt</italic> family members occurs to compensate <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our analysis of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> expression in germ cells from wild type versus heterozygous males showed a similar mechanism exists in male meiotic and haploid germ cells. In addition, our data suggest that within at least spermatids, this mechanism includes altered transcription of the non-coding alternative <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> transcripts.</p><p>While not directly tested here, the simplest explanation for increased transcription of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> in germ cells from heterozygous males, is hypomethylation of the CpG promoter region of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>. In support of this hypothesis, we detected a dramatic increase in <italic>Aire</italic> expression in both spermatocytes and spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018276-g003">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). The <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> and <italic>Aire</italic> promoters are tightly linked on chromosome 10 in the mouse, with only 6.5 kb separating the first exon of each gene in opposite transcriptional directions <xref rid="pone.0018276-Mittaz1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. AIRE (Autoimmune Regulator gene) is a transcription factor expressed in antigen presenting cells in the thymus <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hubert1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and is involved in establishing and maintaining immune tolerance <xref rid="pone.0018276-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Recent work has shown that AIRE is also found in spermatogonia and spermatocytes <xref rid="pone.0018276-Schaller1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and that an absence of <italic>Aire</italic> leads to male infertility most likely at the level of the epididymis <xref rid="pone.0018276-Hubert2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our data shows that <italic>Aire</italic> is also expressed in spermatids and strongly supports a co-regulatory relationship between <italic>Aire</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>. As both <italic>Aire</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> promoters are known to be regulated by CpG island methylation, the compensatory up-regulation of the full length <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> splice variant from the remaining wild type allele, and the prominent over-expression of <italic>Aire</italic> in both spermatocytes and spermatids from <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males, strongly supports a mechanism whereby hypomethylation of the shared promoter has lead to increased promoter access. These data also raise the possibility that at least part of the phenotype observed herein is a consequence of increased <italic>Aire</italic> transcription.</p><p>Despite mRNA data showing <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> expression in the testis, the detection of DNMT3L in the adult testis or in sperm has not previously been reported. Our data confirmed the expression of all four <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> splice variants in spermatocytes and round spermatids, and we have localized DNMT3L protein in round and elongating spermatids and in mature sperm. Further, the presence of DNMT3L in wildtype sperm raise the possibility that DNMT3L is carried through to the zygote/embryo where it may impact on health. The potential role of DNMT3L in the embryo was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Collectively, we have shown that the loss of a <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> allele results in a partial failure of X chromosome condensation during male meiosis and subsequently, a three fold increase in XY chromosome non-disjunction. We have shown that altered <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> expression results in changes in spermatocyte and spermatid gene expression. We have shown that there is a previously unrecognised compensatory up-regulation of both the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> full length and alternative transcripts in germ cells from <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> heterozygous males. We have shown that DNMT3L protein is found within both haploid male germ cells and mature sperm.

The Mouse Genome Informatics database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">http://www.informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>) showed no single nucleotide polymorphisms between 129S6/SvEvTac and C57BL/6J. The LacZ reporter gene including three stop codons and the loxP flanked PGK-neomycin cassette, were sub-cloned in-frame into coding exon 5, thus disrupting the PHD-like zinc finger domain. The targeting vector was electroporated into C57BL/6 ES cells and clones selected in G418-containing medium. Targeted ES cells were microinjected into Balb/C blastocysts to generate chimeras. Chimeric males were mated with C57BL/6 females to generate C57BL/6 offspring. The PGK-Neo cassette was removed via Cre-loxP mediated excision by breeding the mice to a cre transgenic strain on a C57BL/6 background. Specifically, the cre transgenic strain was created in BALB/cJ and was backcrossed to C57BL/6J for at least 10 generations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/006054.html">http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/006054.html</ext-link>). The cre (and thus BALB/cJ) -ve <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> colony has been maintained by crossing heterozygotes or crossing to wildtype C57BL/6 for well over 10 generations. Thus the wildtype and heterozygous mice used in these experiments are essentially C57BL/6.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Meiotic Spreads and immunofluorescent labelling</title><p>Methods for meiotic spreads were prepared as described previously <xref rid="pone.0018276-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at a 1/200 dilution in 10&#x00025; ADB and applied to each section. Slides were incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C or for 2 hours at room temperature in a dark box and then washed in PBS three times for 15 minutes each.

<xref rid="pone.0018276-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. To enable FISH probes to easily pass into the sperm nucleus, sperm heads needed to be decondensed. Sperm were collected from dissected cauda epididymides by snipping at several locations and placed into sterile pre-warmed PBS at 37&#x000b0;C to allow the sperm to swim out. The sperm solution was filtered through a 100 &#x000b5;m mesh filter and spotted onto Superfrost plus microscope slides (Menzel-Gl&#x000e4;ser). Using the edge of a coverslip the drops were smeared along the slide as a thin film and slides were dried on a slide warmer.</p><p>The sperm smears were dehydrated in 80&#x00025; methanol at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes and air dried. A microwave safe plastic container with a divider in the middle was filled with 100 ml of distilled water and two slides were placed on the top section of the container above the water. A combination of microwaving while incubating slides in a reducing agent was conducted. 200 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) was applied to the slides and the samples were covered with a coverslip. The slides were microwaved in the container for 15 seconds at 550W, then drained and 200 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM Lithium diiodosalicylate/1 mM DTT buffer was applied. The slides were covered with a coverslip and microwaved for 90 seconds at 550 W, then rinsed twice with 2X SSC and air dried for 30 minutes and after fixing with methanol:acetic acid (3:1) for 10 minutes, they were air dried and used immediately for FISH.</p><p>To prevent excessive chromosome denaturation, slides were placed on a slide warmer at 50&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. 1 &#x000b5;l of each of the X (directly labelled with FITC) and Y (directly labelled with CY3) probes (Cambio Ltd.) were diluted together in 3 &#x000b5;l of hybridization buffer (Cambio Ltd.). The probes were denatured at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, then pre-annealed at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes and applied to the slides and the area was covered with a 10 mm<sup>2</sup> coverslip and sealed with rubber glue. The probes, together with the sperm, were denatured by placing the slides on a slide warmer at 75&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes, and then incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber.</p><p>Following removal of the rubber glue, post-hybridization washes were conducted as follows: (a) 1X SSC solution at 70&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02013;3 minutes, (b) 1X SSC/50&#x00025; formamide at 45&#x000b0;C twice for 5 minutes each, (c) 1X SSC at 45&#x000b0;C twice for 5 minutes each, (d) 4X SSC/0.05&#x00025; Tween 20 at 45&#x000b0;C twice for 5 minutes each.
