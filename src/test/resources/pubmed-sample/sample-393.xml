Introduction </title><p>An integration of biomedical implants in the human organism depends on the surface properties, chemical composition, as well as mechanical properties of the materials. In the past, most clinically used materials were developed based on their acceptance by the human body. Nowadays, beneficial interactions of implant with cells and proteins gather a growing importance. An application of biomaterials in blood contacting devices is threatened by hemocompatibility failure due to the lack of an anti-thrombogenic mechanism. Under physiological conditions this mechanism is provided by the endothelium lining of the internal surface of blood vessels. An exposure to this challenging biological environment requires surface engineering for cardiovascular devices to improve the integrity with the human body [<xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] without influencing the structural and mechanical properties of the bulk material. Modern blood contacting materials dedicated to cardiovascular implants are expected to preferably support endothelial cells adhesion and resist interaction with blood cells that can lead to thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia [<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the current biomaterial development is highly related to the biocompatibility improvement through manufacturing surfaces mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM) that will facilitate the endothelialization process in vivo. Besides providing a structural support to cells, the ECM also plays an important role in modulating numerous cellular functions. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films made of natural polymers are one approach to obtain ECM mimicking coatings [<xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PEMs similar to the ECM, are dynamic assemblies that are undergoing remodeling in response to various stimuli, providing cells with an environment adjustable to their biochemical and mechanical properties. These may facilitate surface repopulation of the blood-contacting implant by the endothelial progenitor cells as well as mask the material from an inflammatory response and reduce risk of thrombosis in vivo. The physicochemical properties of multilayer coatings can be also modulated in vitro. Therefore PEMs are a promising system to investigate the hemocompatibility response to varying surface characteristics. The chemical cross-linking mechanism alters the interaction between polymer functional groups, therefore it is generally applied for the regulation of stability and physicochemical properties. An alternative method in PEMs modification involves nanoparticles incorporation. This new generation of modified PEMs still requires an improved understanding of how changes in their physicochemical properties regulate response of blood cells. Therefore, our work was focused on the development of PEM coatings with different characteristics. The goal was to determine material properties, which are crucial for the hemocompatibility improvement of biomaterials dedicated to cardiovascular applications. Among the natural polymers, the PEM systems composed of chitosan/chondroitin sulfate (Chi/CS) were chosen as the most promising blood-contacting materials because of efficient endothelialization [<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and potential antimicrobial effect [<xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The physico-chemical properties of the Chi/CS film were modified by chemical cross-linking or nanoparticles incorporation. In these studies, an effect of cross-linking agents N-hydroxysulphosuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (NHS/EDC) was examined that is also widely described in literature. Two different types of nanoparticles i.e., silver (Ag) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been taken into consideration because of the increasing interest in their broad spectrum of applications, especially as the antimicrobial agents in a fight against the biomaterial associated infections (BAIs) [<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, it has been observed that incorporation of nanoparticles might be an alternative method of coatings stabilization [<xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The presence of nanoparticles in the film structure limits inter-diffusion of polymers and therefore has an effect on a swelling behavior and surface properties of the film. The tunable material features, developed in this work, revealed how the substrate properties modulate biomaterial hemocompatibility through the interaction with plasma proteins as well as blood-morphotic elements under dynamic conditions. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-nanomaterials-10-00859"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>The polyelectrolyte multilayer films were prepared from low molecular weight cationic chitosan (Chi) and anionic chondroitin sulfate (CS) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA).

At first, chitosan was pre-dissolved in 0.1 M acetic acid. Because of its simple solubility, the second polymer, chondroitin sulfate, was dissolved in water. No pre-dissolution step was needed. Total of 0.5 mg/mL Chi and 1 mg/mL CS were used. Polymer solutions were prepared in 0.15 M sodium chloride (NaCl) and the pH was adjusted to 5.5. Films were built-up with a special automatic dipping machine, where substrates were immersed in solutions of polycation and polyanion for 8 min each. In order to remove non-bonded polymer chains from the substrate, after the deposition process, the substrates were rinsed in 0.15 M NaCl solution set to pH 5.5.

Afterwards, the NHS/EDC was removed by a combination of 10 mM HEPES and 0.15 M NaCl solution buffered at pH 7.4. A two-stage washing procedure was carried out, in which films, at first, were rinsed two times for one h under slow shaking.

Profiles of force-indentation were performed using borosilicate sphere-tipped cantilever with a radius of 2.5 &#x000b5;M and a nominal spring constant of 60 mN/m. Hertz model was chosen for nanoindentation tests. This model perfectly fits the analyzed data over the indentation curve from 30 nm to 100 nm indentation depth, where the accuracy is still provided. Because of the high water content of the coatings, the incompressibility was presumed. Two measurements were performed in six different positions for each analyzed sample. The least-squares fitting method was selected for Young moduli calculations using the force-indentation curves. </p><p>The topography of the coating with silver or graphene flakes was investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The samples were sputter coated with a gold thin film and imaging was performed using a FEI Versa 3D FEG SEM (FEI, Krakow, Poland), with an acceleration voltage of 1 kV and electron beam current of 4.0 nA.</p><p>The deposition kinetics and hydrated film thickness were evaluated with the QCM-D technique (Q-Sense E4 system, Q-Sense AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) which has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The AT cut piezoelectric quartz crystals coated with gold were cleaned with piranha solution, rinsed with distilled water, dried in N2 and treated by UV prior to the experiments. The system was primed with a 0.15 M NaCl solution (buffer baseline). The polyelectrolyte solutions were injected alternately into the measurement cell at a flow rate of 50 mL/min using a peristaltic pump. A rinsing with a 0.15 M NaCl solution was performed between the adsorption of each polyelectrolyte. The thickness changes were monitored after subsequent film modification. The QCM-D method was also used to evaluate swelling of the PEM after 14 days of incubation in a physiological salt. The film thickness has been determined using the Voigt based model, defined as a spring and dashpot in parallel. The Qtools software (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) was applied to fit results. Changes in resonance frequency and dissipation for four overtones (the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th overtone) were fitted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-nanomaterials-10-00859"><title>2.5. Dynamic Blood-Material Interaction Assay</title><p>The Impact R test is used in clinics to evaluate thrombotic diseases and the effectiveness of anti-platelet drugs. Here this test was adjusted to detect adverse interactions between the artificial material and whole human blood. The whole blood contained sodium citrate anticoagulant and was obtained from Regional Donation Centre in Cracow, Poland. Blood was activated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 20 &#x000b5;M final concentration) for 5 min. These samples served as the control for platelets capacity to activate. Testing of materials in shear stress conditions was performed with cone-and-plate analyzer (CPA, Impact-R, DiaMed AG, Switzerland). The PU was chosen as a substrate for the PEMs deposition and as a control for our experiments because it is recently used for fabrication of cardiovascular devices. The PEMs may find future application in its surface functionalization. Polyurethane and other tested materials were prepared in the form of disks (14.4 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness). As recommended by the manufacturer, a 130 &#x000b5;L blood volume was used for each experiment. The dynamic test was applied at a shear rate of 1800 s for 300 s, using a disposable Teflon conical rotor. Following the shear test, the rotor was removed, and blood was immediately sampled from the well to the test tubes for flow cytometry analysis. The tested coatings were taken and evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).

It has been noticed that reduced graphene oxide flakes incorporation resulted in a significant increase of the elastic modulus value (158 &#x000b1; 10 kPa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00859-f002">Figure 2</xref>d). Finally, mechanical properties of PEMs with silver nanoparticles obtained by in situ nucleation were evaluated. It was found that nanoparticles immobilization led to an increase of the elastic modulus and presented the highest value among all considered groups (213 &#x000b1; 12 kPa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00859-f002">Figure 2</xref>d). The unmodified coating containing Ag indicated significantly higher stiffness than the unmodified film without nanoparticles.

The Chi/CS multilayer film thickness increases exponentially as the number of bilayers increased, because of inter-diffusion of polyelectrolytes within the multilayer. The final thickness of the non-cross-linked PEM was 420 &#x000b1; 15 nm. The thickness of the Chi/CS film increased to 482 &#x000b1; 20 nm after in situ nucleation of silver nanoparticles.

Surface coverage by plasma proteins was also determined after Chi/CS film structure stabilization by nanoparticles. It has been observed that the introduction of the reduced graphene oxide flakes resulted in a significant decrease in protein adsorption compared to the native coatings. Similarly, the silver nanoparticles immobilization within PEM led to a decrease of adsorbed proteins on the coating surface. </p><p>The blood&#x02013;material interactions were evaluated based on the tests simulating aortic-shear-stress conditions. The microscopic observations of the sample&#x02019;s surface were performed in order to assess the number of aggregates (leukocyte-platelet, platelet-platelet, monocyte-platelet), activated platelets and adhered leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00859-f005">Figure 5</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00859-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The unmodified Chi/CS surface observations indicated the lowest coverage by blood elements among all the investigated samples (including PU control). Chemical cross-linking of the Chi/CS film with NHS/EDC solution increased the surface coverage, however the obtained values were below the ones for the control sample. The cross-linking of the Chi/CS coating increased the level of the von Willebrand&#x02019;s factor, P-selectin positive objects as well as the contribution of both platelet and platelet-leukocyte aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00859-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The hemocompatibility was also determined for PEMs with nanoparticles. It has been noticed that the immobilization of the reduced graphene oxide flakes resulted in a lower blood element adhesion on tested coatings when compare to PU control and the NHS/EDC cross-linked film.

In the presence of rGO, the level of the von Willebrand&#x02019;s factor and platelet aggregates decreased, whereas the number of P-selectin positive objects was significantly higher than on the unmodified PEMs. Blood&#x02014;material interaction was also determined for the film containing silver nanoparticles. Surface investigation has shown higher surface coverage, especially with the P-selectin positive objects than in case of the native Chi/CS film. The level of the von Willebrand&#x02019;s factor and platelet aggregates decreased in comparison to unmodified as well as cross-linked films. </p><p>The number of blood elements on the surface of each type of investigated PEM was lower than in case of the PU sample.

The expression of P-selectin has a strong positive correlation with the film stiffness and a weak negative correlation with the surface roughness and wettability.

The formation of platelet-monocyte aggregates was independent of the surface properties. The evaluation of blood parameters correlation with surface properties has shown that the coatings stiffness had an influence only on the formation of the platelet-based aggregates.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-nanomaterials-10-00859"><title>4.1. Simultaneous Multiparameter Changes in the Physicochemical Properties of PEMs </title><p>The PEM films differ with the internal structure, and the surface properties depend on if they are built from weak or strong polyelectrolytes, or a combination of the above mentioned. In this study, PEMs were fabricated based on an interaction between chitosan, which is a week polycation with a strong polyanion, chondroitin sulfate. The strong polyanion presence in the PEM made it thin and hydrophobic because of the increased electrostatic complexation with chitosan counterions. Chitosan has a high charge density especially in acidic environments, which allowed a formation of ionic complexes and acted as a driving force in coating formation. Interaction of hydrogen bonds defined the hydration of chondroitin sulfate, which had an effect on film thickness. Fu et al. discovered changes in PEM roughness with the increase of pH solution in chitosan/heparin coatings. PEMs surfaces were smoother if the polyelectrolytes were deposited from strong acidic solutions (~pH 4). Chitosan possesses weak chain charges at higher pH values. Therefore, films had a rougher surface when assembled at high pH. Similarly, wettability results showed high contact angle in films assembled at pH 6, whereas smallest contact angle, which indicates hydrophilicity, was found at pH 3 [<xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Crouzier et al. have observed that the pH and ionic strength also determined mechanical properties of PEMs. The stiffness of the polysaccharide&#x02013;polysaccharide system was dependent on exponential film build up [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These films were considered to be softer than PEMs, which are built up in linear manner. In this study, the Chi/CS multilayers have been deposited from the solutions of pH 5.5. The investigated unmodified PEM has shown exponential thickness growth. Oppositely, to the previously described chitosan/heparin films, our coatings were rougher and stiffer. Moreover, it has been found that the films were more hydrophobic than other polysaccharide-based PEMs deposited under similar conditions [<xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. </p><p>Further changes in surface roughness, wettability, and stiffness of Chi/CS films were observed after the applied cross-linking. Coatings became smoother, stiffer, and more hydrophilic in comparison to the native ones. We attribute the changes to new bond formation between free functional groups and a lower level of inter-diffusion within the coating. Schneinder et al. have also proven that cross-linked PEMs were ten times stiffer than native films. They have shown that the degree of cross-linking influenced film structure. It led to an increase in roughness and hydrophilicity [<xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Incorporation of nanoparticles in the PEMs was used as an alternative method for stabilization of film structure, but also in order to modulate its physicochemical properties and provide with antimicrobial potential. Over the years, various methods for introduction of metal nanoparticles in PEMs have been developed. One of the approaches is in situ photoreduction, in which films can be immersed in AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution and then exposed to UV radiation. While the ionized acid groups, e.g., carboxylic acid and sulfuric acid groups are responsible for electrostatic interaction with the polycation, the nonionized acid groups can bind to metal ions via ions exchange [<xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The reduction method chosen for the in situ process could have an effect on the surface properties. Jang et al. have observed that the presence of AgNPs in the structure of poly(ethyleneimine)/hyaluronic acid multilayers led to an increase in roughness. The same researchers have described the relation between the number of bilayers and AgNP formation [<xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mzyk et al. analyzed PEMs structure of chitosan/chondroitin sulfate and have found that AgNP did not create a separate layer within the multilayer, but it was distributed in PEMs in the form of aggregates [<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, they have found that stiffness of AgNP-PEMs was significantly higher than in the case of unmodified films. Wettability investigation of strong polyelectrolytes interaction presented by Zan et al. indicated ion exchange of counterions Na<sup>+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</sup>, in which the ion pair R-SO<sub>3</sub>-Ag<sup>+</sup> was less hydrated than R-SO<sub>3</sub>-Na<sup>+</sup>. This resulted in higher hydrophobicity of the silver containing PEM [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this article, we have observed that introduction of silver nanoparticles led to a decrease in surface roughness, differently to results presented by Jang et al. [<xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Wettability analysis showed an increase of the hydrophilicity of AgNP films. The coatings also demonstrated higher stiffness in comparison to unmodified films. Hence, the formation of polyelectrolyte-silver complexes resulted in a certain distribution of silver nanoparticles which affected the surface properties. </p><p>Besides the modification with the silver nanoparticles, our work also presents another approach to modulate PEM&#x02019;s physicochemistry. rGO flakes were mixed with a polyanionic solution and introduced into the film during the layer-by-layer deposition process. Graphene oxide (GO) indicates amphiphilic properties, where the basal plane is hydrophobic, and edges are hydrophilic [<xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Because of multiple oxygen-containing groups i.e., hydroxyl, carboxyl, reduced graphene oxide particles can create strong interactions with chondroitin sulfate (polyanion), such as hydrogen or &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; bonding and can be easily dispersed [<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, in this study reduced graphene oxide immobilization within PEM caused an increase in stiffness and hydrophilicity. According to Kulkarni et al. the surface roughness of PEMs after modification with rGO decreases because of the atomic smoothness of rGO [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the presented work, an analogous phenomenon was observed. Hence, regarding the morphological properties of PEMs incorporated with silver nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide, it was found that both systems indicate similar physicochemical properties. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-nanomaterials-10-00859"><title>4.2. Correlation of the PEMs Physicochemical Properties with Hemocompatibility</title><p>The success of an implanted biomaterial depends on the biological reactions occurring at its surface. Protein adsorption from blood is recognized as the first event following blood&#x02013;biomaterial contact that depends on the previously elaborated surface properties such as chemistry, wettability, stiffness, and topography [<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The adsorbed protein layer may subsequently influence the platelet activation and aggregation process. Therefore, an understanding of the interactions between implants and the surrounding biological environment has been a major focus of this research. </p><p>The influence of biomaterial roughness on thrombogenicity is not clear, and various studies have shown conflicting results. Cai et al. [<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that the surface roughness had a little effect on protein adsorption on titanium materials with roughness values in the range of 2&#x02013;21 nm. When surface features are in the same size regime as the adsorbing protein, geometric parameters such as height, width, and the separation of the nanofeatures are likely to affect how the proteins adsorb as proposed by Roach et al. They have suggested that a high aspect ratio and small separation (&#x0003c;200 nm) of nano features significantly reduced platelet activation [<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It was also found that adsorption of the platelet-binding protein fibrinogen was reduced on surface features in the same size regime. In an earlier publication they found that surface nanostructures in the sub 100 nm regime attenuated the activation of the immune complement system. They proposed a mechanism where protein&#x02013;surface interactions were altered because of the curvature of the nanostructure. Bailly et al. compared angiographic catheters with different surface roughness and concluded that the smoothest material was thrombogenic [<xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Zingg et al. described that the increased roughness under dynamic conditions caused a decrease in platelet adhesion on hydrophilic surfaces and opposite response on hydrophobic surfaces. During the static test conditions, no difference between smooth and rough surfaces was found [<xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, it has been found that PEM&#x02019;s morphological properties affected proteins adsorption. Herein, rougher surface have promoted higher protein adsorption. The unmodified films indicated the worst antiadhesive properties. Although, we have observed changes in the amount of adsorbed proteins, these changes did not correlate with the level of P-selectin objects, the von Willebrand factor and the number of aggregates attached to the PEM surface. Our research clearly shows that PEM&#x02019;s topography has an influence on the platelet&#x02019;s activation. However, we have not found that obvious correlation of the film roughness with the number of aggregates and von Willebrand factor on its surface. Moreover, we have not observed correlation of the number of platelet aggregates in blood with the roughness of the investigated PEM. A weak correlation with film surface morphology was found for the activated platelets and the microparticles in blood, for which the number increased after contact with rougher coatings.</p><p>While the thrombus adhesion seems to be related to surface texture, some researchers have shown that the formation of a thrombus depends on the wettability of biomaterial. Contact angles above the 65&#x000b0; can have a significant impact on proteins adsorption, in a manner that depends on the nature of the functional groups. Wettability influences the time-dependent conformational changes in adsorbed proteins and mediate adsorption kinetics and binding strengths [<xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as subsequent protein activity [<xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Results of plasma protein adsorption presented in this study agree with the previous work [<xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], where protein adsorption increased on surface with higher hydrophobicity. Moreover, this research has shown that an increase in wettability was positively correlated with changes of coating hemocompatibility under dynamic conditions. Platelets that adhered to the hydrophilic PEM are easily detached from the surface under applied shear forces and less likely formed aggregates than on hydrophobic surface. In our previous work we have shown that the described effect is related to higher contribution of the von Willebrand factor in aggregate formation when blood gets into the contact with the hydrophilic surface [<xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study we have also observed the higher number of circulating aggregates in the presence of hydrophilic coatings that was correlated with a lower contribution of the P-selectin positive platelets. </p><p>How the mechanical properties of the PEMs affect platelet activation and physiology under blood flow, also remains largely unknown. Oui Y. et al. [<xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found that the number of adherent platelets on the PA gel surfaces after incubation increased with increasing substrate stiffness, reaching a plateau (~10,000 platelets per mm<sup>2</sup>) on 50-kPa PA gels and stiffer. Moreover, their findings suggest that fibrinogen concentration and substrate stiffness are independent factors that affect platelet adhesion and spreading and appear to affect platelet behavior synergistically. But the relationship between the effects may not be linear. This is consistent with the report showing that platelet adhesion and spreading on immobilized fibrinogen involve different signaling pathways [<xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Yu D. et al. have shown that platelet adhesion had increased with the number of PEM layers and suggested that the swelling or mechanical properties of the PEM films may not direct the platelet adhesion [<xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Kerch G. et al. designed PEMs based on chitosan/chitosan sulfate and described that stiffness of the outermost layer is important to determine the platelets adhesion&#x02014;if the stiffness is low, the adhesion decreases [<xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, we have not observed a relation of coating stiffness with the amount of adsorbed proteins. However, we have found that the number of activated platelets (the P-selectin positive) on the surface increased with increasing the coating stiffness. In contrary, there were less aggregates and von Willebrand factor found on the stiffer films. We also found a significant increase in the number of aggregates circulating in the blood after contact with stiffer PEMs. </p><p>Although this work already elaborates the influence of multiple physicochemical parameters on hemocompatibility, we have realized that even broader characterization is necessary for further understanding of the phenomena. We have found that the investigated physicochemical properties of films modified with silver and reduced graphene oxide were similar. In our opinion, the discrepancy in the hemocompatibility of these PEMs may be a result of the different type of functional groups exposed on the film surface or/and their electrokinetic potentials. Meng et al. have described the chitosan/heparin films interaction with blood under dynamic conditions [<xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. They discovered that platelets easily attached to weak polyelectrolytes such as chitosan. On the other hand, heparin (Hep), which is a strong polyelectrolyte, proved to inhibit adhesion, therefore the whole system indicated anticoagulation properties. Authors have suggested that the improved hemocompatibility was a result of the electrostatic repulsive interaction between negatively charged functional groups of heparin, proteins, and platelets. Similarly, Kuo et al. have analyzed blood-PEMs interaction under static conditions and they confirmed that once the outermost layer in PEMs is negatively charged then the adhesion of platelets is significantly lower [<xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Research presented by Kerch et al. showed lower platelet adhesion for chitosan/heparin films, where chitosan was deposited as an outermost layer. This research led to the conclusion that the surface charge is not the key regulator of platelet adhesion [<xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, negatively charged chondroitin sulfate was deposited as the outermost layer. In comparison to heparin, which possesses strong anticoagulant properties, the CS has a smaller amount of sulfate groups. This may have a strong influence on the PEM wettability and therefore results in different response from the blood morphotic elements. Studies of other authors on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) functionalized with controlled moieties showed that after whole blood incubation, surfaces functionalized with &#x02013;CH<sub>3</sub> groups lead to an increased platelet adhesion, while on &#x02013;OH terminated SAMs only leukocytes adhere. In contrast neither platelets nor leukocytes adhere on &#x02013;COOH presenting surfaces [<xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-10-00859" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Herein, coatings with incorporated silver and reduced graphene oxide flakes showed lower levels of platelet adhesion, which may be related to the higher number of negatively charged groups on the surface compared to the unmodified films. &#x02013;OH groups on the surface of coatings with rGO were found by many researchers. However, contrary to the previously discussed research, herein we have not observed increase of leucocytes attachment. It could be an effect of their lower availability due to compensation by positively charged groups from chitosan. It is also possible that functional groups other than &#x02013;OH were more abundant at the surface of graphene flakes. In a consequence this may lead to the formation of a protein layer which vary in a composition and/or conformation of molecules and eventually result in different blood-material interactions. This hypothesis should be the subject of further investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nanomaterials-10-00859"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>A simple and universal method is still needed for surface modification to improve the hemocompatibility of biomaterials. In this work we have presented, for the first time, how the PEM&#x02019;s physicochemical properties influence blood proteins adhesion, platelets activation, and aggregates formation under dynamic conditions. At the same time PEMs, as an easily tunable film model, are giving the opportunity to find relations between properties which may also apply to many other complex coatings designed for the functionalization of cardiovascular devices. We have found strong correlation between stiffness of the PEMs and active platelets and platelet-based aggregates adhesion to the surface. Moreover, based on the obtained results we think that wettability determines attachment stability of the active platelets and aggregates to the PEMs. In comparison to our previous work on hemocompatibility of the carbon-based thin ceramic coatings, the phenomena observed at the blood&#x02014;PEMs interface could not be described easily either by rolling, or two-stage aggregation mechanism. It will be possible only by further developing the understanding of cross-talk between various surface parameters. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by IMMS PAS, Medical Department of Jagiellonian University and AGH University.
