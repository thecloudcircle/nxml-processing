Our general objective is to inquire what are the best procedures to communicate conceptual knowledge. We construct a simplified and controlled setup emulating important variables of pedagogy amenable to quantitative analysis. To this aim, we designed a game inspired in Chinese Whispers, to investigate which attributes of a description affect its capacity to faithfully convey an image. This is a two player game: an emitter and a receiver. The emitter was shown a simple geometric figure and was asked to describe it in words. He was informed that this description would be passed to the receiver who had to replicate the drawing from this description. We capitalized on vast data obtained from an android app to quantify the effect of different aspects of a description on communication precision. We show that descriptions more effectively communicate an image when they are coherent and when they are procedural. Instead, the creativity, the use of metaphors and the use of mathematical concepts do not affect its fidelity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by University of Buenos Aires, CONICET (Argentina) and ANPCyT (Argentina).

<italic>&#x0201c;Leaving hopes and utopias apart, probably the most lucid ever written about language are the following words by Chesterton: He knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless, and more nameless than the colours of an autumn forest&#x02026; Yet he seriously believes that these things can every one of them, in all their tones and semitones, in all their blends and unions, be accurately represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized stockbroker can really produce out of this own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of memory and all the agonies of desire.&#x0201d;</italic>
</p><p>Jorge Luis Borges (The analytical language of John Wilkins)</p></disp-quote><p>Chinese whispers, also known as broken telephone, is a game in which a message is passed through a line of people. The last player announces the message which is often very different from the one that was uttered by the first. The game illustrates how different sources of noise accumulate, contaminating verbal communication.</p><p>However, even in the absence of noise, language poses a structural limitation in human communication. As expressed by JL Borges in the quote above, inner concepts are much richer than the words that describe them. Moreover, the same words often construct very distinct mental representations in different individuals. This is, of course, an essential problem of pedagogy: how to faithfully communicate concepts using words.</p><p>This abilitiy is often refered as <italic>Communicative competence</italic>, i.e. the grammatical knowledge and skill of use as well as the social adaptation in communication [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Chomsky pointed out two related concepts: competence and performance, that is the grammatical and social knowledge and the effectiveness of the communication process given the previous competence [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These terms&#x02014;Competence and performance&#x02014;have been widely studied in the learning and teaching of second language [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142579.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>One of the most popular ways to evaluate the communicative effectiveness is the language tests. The applied linguistics literature has deeply detailed how to design and quantify language tests [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142579.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. How to assess each area of language, e.g. reading, writing, or communication for specific purposes, has its own difficulties. Moreover, how to measure tests and interpret quantitative results remains as an open problem, e.g. Luoma&#x02019;s book on speaking assessment [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Instead, we propose a completely different approach by quantifying the communicative competence and performance by crowdsourcing the evaluation process. Motivated by Games With A Purpose (GWAP)[<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we measure both competence and performance asking people to vote this abilities in a game. Here we designed a game inspired in Chinese Whispers, to investigate which attributes of a description affect its capacity to faithfully convey an image. This is a two player game: an emitter and a receiver. The game consisted in three phases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0142579.g001">Fig 1</xref>). First, the emitter was shown a simple geometric figure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0142579.g001">Fig 1a</xref>) and was asked to describe it in words. Second, she was informed that this description would be passed to the receiver who had to replicate the drawing form this description (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0142579.g001">Fig 1b</xref>). Also, she received a description from another emitter having to replicate the original drawing.</p><fig id="pone.0142579.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0142579.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow graph of the game.</title><p>The panel a) shows the 4 different families of images. Each familiy is composed of 4 variations of the same image. Panel b) shows a different possible flowgraphs. Starting with a real image example, from this image, many different subjects created different written descriptions, with one of these as instruction, other distinct subjects drew different pictures. Panel c) shows the three differents scores: 1) Communication Score: visual similarity among an image and a drawn picture. 2) Description Score: the quality of the written text as instruction to replay the image 3) Draw Score: the <italic>power of the explanation</italic> for the written description concerning the drawn picture. Beside these scores, the subjects rated pairs of image-written text some <italic>Speech properties</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0142579.g001"/></fig><p>Several studies have shown that images with high emotional content capture more attention than neutral ones (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). To avoid the interference with these <italic>distractors</italic>, we selected pictures with geometrical figures, which are pictures with neutral emotion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0142579.g001">Fig 1a</xref>).</p><p>Once the writing and drawing phases were completed, participants were asked to rank different stages of the communication process of other players (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0142579.g001">Fig 1c</xref>): 1) the quality of the description of the geometric figure produced by the emitter (&#x0201c;<italic>Description score</italic>&#x0201d; or communication competence), 2) the quality of the drawing produced by the receiver given the description that he obtained (&#x0201c;<italic>Drawing score</italic>&#x0201d;), 3) the visual similarity of the original figure and the resulting drawing (&#x0201c;<italic>Communication score</italic>&#x0201d; or communication performance).</p><p>To assess the performance of a description, participants ranked five different speech properties of each description:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Its creativity. There is a growing belief in the general public that creativity [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] is a fundamental aspect of effective human communication. Here we examine this in a quantitative manner to investigate whether &#x02013;for this narrow class of human communication&#x02013; the perceived creativity of a description correlates with the success to effectively communicate a message.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of metaphors. Metaphors is vastly used in the educational discourse, particularly in teaching the common sense in scientific knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We investigate how this description strategy performs in communicating geometrical figures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Its coherence. Danielle McNamara and collaborators have shown that text comprehension is mostly determined by its cohesion, i.e. how topics in a text are related to each other [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hence our first driving hypothesis is that the degree of coherence &#x02013;which is a main factor driving cohesion&#x02013; should be a very strong indicator of the communication score of a description.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whether it was procedural or not. Some pedagogical traditions have placed a strong emphasis in the description of procedures (for instance inclined to use logo like programming in school) [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Here we can settle empirically whether descriptions are more effective when weighted towards procedural terms (i.e. first go to the left corner, then draw a straight line&#x02026;) or containing more mathematical concepts (it is a symmetric triangle, with a square on top).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whether it had mathematical content (mainly geometry and number concepts). our current knowledge does not make clear predictions on whether using more mathematical terms or procedural descriptions should be more effective to convey a geometric image. Since, children from a young age have well developed intuitions of number, shape and other geometric features [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142579.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], one can argue that using mathematical concepts may capitalize on an intuitive description system.</p></list-item></list><p>Our aim is to investigate which of these five aspects of the description (coherence, mathematical-content, procedural, creativity and metaphorical) predicts its capacity to faithfully convey a message.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Procedures</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Android Application</title><p>This experiment was based in an Android Application.

After writing, the second stage is the <italic>description</italic>. Here the subject receives a description produced by another participant. This text was randomly selected with the constraint that was created describing an image of a different category. The subject reads the instructions and then draws in a white canvas. The only two possible actions are draw with black or erase (i.e. draw with white).</p><p>Finally in the last stage, the subjects rate the different parts of the process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0142579.g001">Fig 1b</xref>). The application selected pictures, descriptions or drawings from other players. Participants never received own material to rank.

A description is very coherent when it makes sense and is well formed, allowing fluent reading.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Procedural. A description is procedural if it explicitly presents the steps to get the result.

We show that descriptions more effectively communicate an image when they are coherent and when they are procedural. Instead, the creativity, the use of metaphors and the use of mathematical concepts does not affect its fidelity.</p><p>The motivation for this experiment was to construct a minimal and controlled setup emulating important variables of pedagogy amenable to quantitative analysis. This follows the strategy used by Shafto and Goodman [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142579.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to inquire whether learners adapt to make optimal inferences from the specific examples provided by teachers. Communication and pedagogy are intrinsically related with only subtle differences [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Compared to a typical pedagogical situation this experiment is simplified in three critical parameters: 1) the description is exclusively based on words (there are no gestures, prosody, ostensive indicators, etc. which are known to be fundamental for pedagogy [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142579.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]); 2) there is no dialog or conversation, and hence no online feedback or opportunity to correct errors during the pedagogical process. Instead, our setup builds on a one way message resembling or modeling of an expository lecture; 3) the concept to convey is simplified to a simple geometric figure instead of a more elaborated concepts. Thus we propose this as a model of an extremely eroded and simplified version of a minimal pedagogical dialog. The great advantage of this design is that we can replicate many instances of the same pedagogic process and hence inquire which aspects of the message are relevant for the success of the pedagogical experience.</p><p>The observation that, when filtered for good drawings, the communication and description scores are highly correlated indicate that participants have a good understanding of what constitutes an effective description. This finding is not trivial since students often rely in heuristics to evaluate the effectiveness of a lecture, leads to misperceptions of the quality of a class. For instance, in the well known &#x0201c;Dr. Fox effect&#x0201d; students rely on teacher expressiveness (often more than on its content) to provide teacher ratings [<xref rid="pone.0142579.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study we reasoned that judges may believe that creative or metaphoric explanations would be more effective than they are in reality. This hypothesis was rejected by showing that participants understand that coherence and procedural content are the most effective speech properties of a description and that, conversely, highly creative or highly metaphoric descriptions are not very likely to be effective.</p><p>Many possible hypothesis raise to explain why creativity and metaphorical descriptions are less effective than coherent and procedural ones. On one hand, selected geometrical figures lack of emotional content. Creativity and metaphorical descriptions may be more effective where complex images with contented feelings or emotionally relevant scenes are to be transmitted. Another possible hypothesis may be that communication protocol of experiment affects the effectiveness of different speech properties. Creative and metaphorical descriptions may need of two-way communication channel allowing interaction&#x02014;dialogs&#x02014;between participants, instead of the one-way protocol adopted in this experiment. These alternative hypothesis could be tested by variants of the presented experiment, where different (and tagged) images should be selected or adopting a communication protocol which allows asking for additional details of the description.</p><p>It is important to mention that in our game communication was considered effective when the resulting drawing replicated accurately the original image. In other pedagogical contexts where the goal may not be to optimize the precision of the communicated message, the results are expected to change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the TEDxRioDeLaPlata team for the support during performance, ImagenHB for their assistance in graphical design and the Mobile Research Team at University of Buenos Aires, leaded by Sergio Yovine, for their assistance in mobile application development.
