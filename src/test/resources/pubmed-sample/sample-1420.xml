These variables are used to quantify more than 40 different indicators on farm and household characteristics, welfare, productivity, and economic performance. Between 2015 and the beginning of 2018, the survey instrument was applied in 21 countries in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The data presented here include the raw survey response data, the indicator calculation code, and the resulting indicator values. These data can be used to quantify on- and off-farm pathways to food security, diverse diets, and changes in poverty for rural smallholder farm households.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="summary"><p id="Par2">

Smallholder farm households in these locations produce food not only for themselves, but, in many countries, produce the majority of the national or even the regional food supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Smallholder farm households are also highly diverse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, varying in land area, amount of livestock present, crops grown, and farm management strategies. The importance of understanding the diversity and dynamics of rural households is increasingly crucial, given the diverse effects of global changes in climate, population growth, urbanization, and food demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Achieving the sustainable development goals (in particular the goals of no poverty and zero hunger, but others too) requires more intensified sustainable food production and development of rural economies. Targeted investment to make progress in agricultural development requires understanding the links between farming practices, livelihood practices, and the effects on farm performance and household welfare. Reliable indicators at farm-household level of both farm performance and household welfare are therefore needed to better understand and model these linkages, and to inform the design and implementation of interventions by governments, donors, and international agencies, across a wide range of differing geographies and socio-economic dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The lack of standardization of agricultural household surveys, especially in international &#x02018;agriculture for development&#x02019; research, has resulted in a proliferation of survey tools and indicators leading to datasets which are often badly documented, incoherent, and with limited interoperability. An example of the consequences of this situation is the study of Frelat <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which brought together a series of different household survey datasets, but had a hard time defining a common indicator of food security that could be quantified across all these datasets. The current state of affairs limits our ability to compare outcomes across studies and to draw general conclusions on the effectiveness of interventions and the trade-offs between outcomes, which may be shaped by household structure, farm management and the wider social-environmental context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Efforts like the CGIAR&#x02019;s Big Data Platform have also recognized this situation, and try to define common layouts for household surveys and sets of ontologies underpinning the information to be collected in household surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In contrast, RHoMIS (Rural Household Multiple Indicator Survey; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rhomis.org">www.rhomis.org</ext-link>) is a standardized household survey approach designed to rapidly characterise a series of key indicators across the spectrum of agricultural production and off farm activities, alongside market integration, nutrition, food security, poverty and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It includes a modular survey tool which takes 40&#x02013;60&#x02009;minutes to administer per household, a digital platform to store and aggregate incoming data as well analysis code to quantify indicators and visualize results. Optional modules can be bolted-on. The tool has been systematically designed to enable the quantification of interactions between different components and outcomes of agricultural systems, including productivity, and human welfare at the farm and household level, and it has been widely adopted by research organisations and development partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Such a streamlined, modular approach has resulted in a strong reduction in costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> compared to traditional households surveys in the field (which in other approaches typically take 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;hours per household<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>) and of the subsequent data analysis and reporting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Key indicator groups (modules) generated by all RHoMIS applications.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2020_388_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e934"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">A harmonized dataset has been developed from all the applications of RHoMIS that took place during the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and the first three months of 2018, resulting in a dataset collected from 13,310 farm households across 21 low- and middle-income countries. The overall database (available at the Harvard Dataverse RHoMIS data repository) consists of the raw data (the 758 variables mentioned above; see subdirectory &#x02018;data to share\rhomis_full_data.csv&#x02019;) and 41 indicators calculated based on the information provided by these variables (see subdirectory &#x02018;data to share\rhomis_indicators.csv&#x02019;). The raw data and indicators have already been used for a wide range of studies at site level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, for regional analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and for continental analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Different aspects of smallholder households have been analysed, including gender equity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, dietary diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, nutritional gaps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, poverty and GHG emissions in relation to production intensification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, subsistence- versus market-orientated strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and on-farm vs. off-farm activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

The data are all based on single cross-sectional survey applications. In most applications, households were chosen randomly within the sites in which the different implementing projects were working, but some sampling strategies were aimed at evaluations of project interventions (see Online-only Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">1</xref>, sampling strategy). Three country-wide applications are available in the current database: two led by the iNGO TreeAID in Burkina Faso, where households were selected across the major agro-ecological zones of the country, and one led by the International Livestock Research Institute in Tanzania that sampled cattle owning households, randomly selected from animal health service records. As is clear from Online-only Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the sample sizes differ per application. It is also of key importance to refer to the metadata information file to assess the representativeness of each of the RHoMIS applications. In previous analyses that aimed for statistical inferences valid for farm type, households were grouped by their farm characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, or if an analysis aimed for spatial representativeness, observations were spatially clustered and resampled or weighted by the local population (e.g. village) densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The varied sampling procedures followed by the individual applications make it essential to weight and/or re-sample households in any analysis making use of this combined RHoMIS dataset for valid statistical inferences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The questionnaire</title><p id="Par11">The RHoMIS questionnaire is a set of carefully, expertly designed modules that are administered digitally using the ODK software platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opendatakit.org/">https://opendatakit.org/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The survey is designed to be both flexible enough to suit local contexts and sufficiently standardised to permit rapid deployment, analysis and comparison between multiple sites, without the need for costly post-survey harmonization. The data package that is made available consists of two parts: the dataset itself (containing the raw data and the indicator results) and secondly, the series of documents and analysis code files underpinning the raw data collection effort and the subsequent indicator quantification.

We now explain the procedure in more detail. The starting point are the &#x02018;raw collected&#x02019; data. We have limited the data cleaning step (step 2) to only correcting obviously unrealistic values, such as when it was clear that the recorded value in combination with the reported unit generated an impossible indicator value (say 1.5&#x02009;<italic>kg</italic> of maize yield from a 1&#x02009;ha field; here it is clear that the unit should be <italic>tons</italic> of maize; or similarly if a production of 3,000 <italic>tons</italic> from a 1&#x02009;ha field is reported, it is clear that the unit should be <italic>kg</italic>).

This did not lead to removal of individual observations, we prefer that the user of the data can make their owned informed decisions on this topic. The validation information supplied here is only advice on how the data user might be able to check the quality of the data they want to use and to be able to base decisions on a systematic approach if he or she does decide to remove observations or data points. Note that we used the validation approach (described below) to evaluate each application made available in the current dataset, and that for each application no more than 25% of the data were found to need more attention, which compared to other household survey tools is a good score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Before validation, two key quality filters were applied, correcting some of the observations. One is the earlier mentioned &#x02018;correcting obviously unrealistic values&#x02019;, see the text accompanying Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> for explanation. The second is correction of farm gate price values for the different types of farm produce, which is used in the calculation of several RHoMIS reported indicators. Especially when there are low numbers of observations of a certain type of farm produce, reported price values can be quite extreme values, even when median values are calculated across the dataset of the survey application. We therefore defined ranges of prices (price reported plus or minus 100%) for each commodity based on FAOSTAT data to especially avoid unrealistically high prices which would affect some of the indicators strongly.</p><p id="Par25">The validation process entailed three steps. In step 1 consists of subjective evaluation by the enumerators themselves. These questions are &#x02018;In your opinion, how easily did you establish rapport with the respondent?&#x02019; (with possible answers: &#x02018;Easily&#x02019;, &#x02018;OK&#x02019;, &#x02018;Difficult&#x02019; and &#x02018;Very difficult&#x02019;) and &#x02018;How reliable do you think these answers are? Consider the accuracy and willingness to answer.&#x02019; (with possible answers: &#x02018;Very reliable&#x02019;, &#x02018;Reliable&#x02019;, &#x02018;OK&#x02019;, &#x02018;Occasional doubts&#x02019; and &#x02018;Regular or serious doubts&#x02019;). This information, in combination with the total survey duration (based on start and end time of survey implementation), provides insight on the overall reliability of the information recorded. For example, if the survey duration is extremely long (e.g. beyond 2&#x02009;h) it is also likely that data quality will be questionable. Example results of these quality indicators are given in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, showing the typical distribution of enumerator observed reliability and survey length of survey. This may serve as a useful norm for the initial quality assessment of new RHoMIS applications. The information collected in individual survey applications where the reliability answers show low scores, or where many survey records show abnormally short or long durations, can be more thoroughly investigated or even rejected.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Overview of the three key aspects considered in step 1 of the data quality evaluation (for explanation see text): subjective enumerator evaluation of data quality through &#x02018;establish rapport&#x02019;, &#x02018;perceived reliability&#x02019;, and survey duration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2020_388_Fig4_HTML" id="d29e1328"/></fig></p><p id="Par26">In step 2 we follow the food availability/self-sufficiency approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> to evaluate the overall reliability of the data on production and consumption of farm produce. Calculated livestock productivity and crop yield values are compared to realistic ranges normally encountered in smallholder systems in the agro-ecosystem of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Because the plausible value ranges for these checks are still large, we also scrutinise composite indicators that combine information from a number of survey variables. The two composite indicators we examine for quality assessment are food self-sufficiency and potential food availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The food availability indicator represents the total food energy potentially available daily per household member (adjusted to adult male equivalent calorie demand), and is calculated from the reported consumption of farm products, from cash sales of farm products, and from off-farm activities, whereby all income is converted to a calorific value based on the cost of a local staple crop. Results of these calculations can be used to assess the data quality of information on crop and livestock production, sales and consumption as well as off-farm income. Two problems with this composite indicator are commonly encountered. First, a considerable number of household records at the lower end of the food availability scale appear to suggest an underestimation of calorie availability, suggesting an extreme level of starvation. This may be a true representation of some households, but it can also be an indication of missing information on income or food consumption. Second, a substantial number of households can also show a substantial over-estimation of consumption of crop and livestock products &#x02013; indicating possible problems with yield, consumption or household size estimates. We set a lower bound threshold for food availability at 1,250 kilocalories (kcal) per male adult equivalent per day, which is below the basal metabolic rate for adult males (approximately 1,590&#x02009;kcal for a 60&#x02009;kg male) and adolescents (1,360&#x02009;kcal for a 40&#x02009;kg adolescent male). We set an upper bound for food self-sufficiency (i.e. consumption only) at: (a) 3,500&#x02009;kcal per male adult equivalent per day, representing the average intake of developed nations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; and (b) 5,000&#x02009;kcal, which is double the approximate requirement for an adult male. Observations which fall outside these bounds (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) are used to examine the overall reliability of the survey application and can be used to identify individual survey applications where the data do not appear reliable from a composite perspective. Typically, between 10 and 25% of the records within the total survey sample of an application site may show questionable values of these indicators. These performance values are representative for the uncertainty encountered in recall based cross-sectional farm household surveys, and actually better than the performance of two other widely used sources of farm household information (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). All sites included in the databases published in this article fall within this performance range. Further trust in these findings can be developed by triangulating these results with other indicators of food security included in the RHoMIS surveys, for example HFIAS, dietary diversity and the number of months with hunger (see also step 3).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Step 2 of the data quality evaluation: the identification of systematic under- or over-estimation of production and consumption values based on food self-sufficiency and potential food availability, presented as the relative number of observations.

The information collected by RHoMIS underpins 4 different indicators of food security (HFIAS, dietary diversity, number of months with hunger, and potential food availability).

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> provides examples of the typical relationships encountered between these variables. A strong deviation of the relationships found in a new RHoMIS application from these typical relationships may necessitate a deeper investigation, and might indicate questionable data quality in one or more of these indicators.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Relationships encountered between the household dietary diversity score in the bad season (HDDS Bad Season), potential food availability, the number of months with food insecurity, and the Hunger and Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) status, based on the 2016 Kenya Wote dataset.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2020_388_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e1383"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Usage Notes</title><p id="Par28">The objective of RHoMIS is to gather information on the common variables of interest in all agricultural development research, but not to go too deep into any one topic. The overall strategy of RHoMIS is to collect data which permits an overview of the farming system and the main livelihood activities. Based on this information we can identify farm level constraints, deficiencies or successes, and sift meaning from the high degree of variation observed amongst smallholder households. This is in contrast to the design of many impact assessment studies, which collect data on a narrow topic but at a higher resolution, thus permitting evaluation of that specific topic, but limiting the ability to assess the over-arching farming system and rural livelihoods. This dataset can be used to investigate the characteristics of agricultural systems in low- and middle-income countries at one point in time. On- and off-farm strategies can be analysed in relation to a series of welfare indicators representing food security, poverty and gender equity. This can be done both at individual household level, to disentangle the livelihood strategies of specific household types, but also at population level to determine more generic patterns and investigate equity aspects. We emphasize that the results of such analysis should be interpreted within the context of the data set, considering the potential biases and limitations described in this paper. It is especially important that users note the varied sampling procedures followed in the different RHoMIS applications, and recognise that it essential to weight and/or re-sample the households in any analysis before making any across-site statistical inferences.
