In this study, we investigated whether combined treatment with the ethonolic extract of AC ameliorates cachexia symptoms, especially muscle wasting, in lung tumor-bearing mice treated with chemotherapy. Our results revealed that gemcitabine and cisplatin-induced severe body weight loss and skeletal muscle atrophy in the mice with cancer were greatly attenuated after AC extract administration. The protection may be attributed to the inhibition of skeletal muscle proteolysis by suppressing myostatin and activin release, muscle wasting-related FoxO3/MuRF-1/MAFbx signaling, proteasomal enzyme activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. A significant decrease in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression and formation was observed in the atrophying muscle of the conventional chemotherapy treatment group (CGC), and this decrease was markedly reversed by AC treatment. Additionally, the anorexia, intestinal injury and dysfunction that occurred in the CGC group were mitigated by AC extract. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the AC extract has a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced muscle atrophy mainly by attenuating muscle proteolysis, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and anorexia, and activating IGF-1-dependent protein synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic></kwd><kwd>lung tumor</kwd><kwd>cancer cachexia</kwd><kwd>muscle atrophy</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cancer cachexia is characterized by body weight loss, anorexia, fatigue, inflammation and abnormal metabolism, thereby markedly reducing quality of life and limiting the application of conventional therapy such as chemotherapy [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. More than 80% of patients with advanced cancer suffer from cachexia, and cancer cachexia is estimated to account for at least 20% of deaths in patients with cancer [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, how to prevent and attenuate the development of cancer cachexia is a key concern during cancer therapy. Muscle wasting, the most prominent phenotypic feature of cancer cachexia, is closely related to the tumor site, size, stage, and treatment type [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During cachexia, muscle proteolysis is predominately triggered by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). The forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor is a key factor for activating the expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin conjugating enzymes E3 ligase, F-box (MAFbx)/atrogin-1 and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF-1). The ubiquitinated target protein substrate can be recognized by the 26S proteasome and then digested to peptides, which in turn leads to muscle protein degradation [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Increased ubiquitinated protein expression and proteasome activity have been observed in atrophying muscle [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely, mice that are deficient in either MAFbx or MuRF-1 exhibit greater resistance to atrophy [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], suggesting that suppressing the FoxO/MAFbx/MuRF-1/UPS cascade is a promising strategy of preventing the muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia. The process of cancer cachexia-evoked muscle atrophy is complex and multifactorial; it is mediated by the interplay of tumor factors, host factors, and the interaction between the two [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>To date, chemotherapy remains a widely used option for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, several deleterious effects have been identified after chemotherapy, thereby limiting its application [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Currently, combined treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine (2&#x02019;, 2&#x02019;-difluorodeoxycytidine) and cisplatin (cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum) is a common regimen for treating metastatic lung cancer. However, many side effects, including nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal mucosal injury, and severe muscle wasting, have been reported in patients with cancer treated with cisplatin [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These findings imply that chemotherapy itself can induce muscle atrophy [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although various drugs and supplements have been used, cancer cachexia-evoked skeletal muscle mass loss remains a major problem. Therefore, developing more effective and safe chemotherapeutic adjuvants or nutritional supplements to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting is urgent.</p><p><italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> (AC), a medical fungus, grows only on the inner cavity of the endemic species <italic>Cinnamomum kanehirai,</italic> which is a plant native to Taiwan. AC extracts have been demonatrated to possess several beneficial effects, including antioxidant, hepato-protective, anti-hypertensive, anti-hyperlipidemic, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the effects of AC extract on cancer cachexia remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether AC attenuates these cachectic symptoms, particularly the muscle atrophy, in lung tumor-bearing mice under chemotherapy, and to further investigate the molecular mechanisms involved.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Chemical characteristics of the AC extract and its effects on tumor growth</title><p>Data from the HPLC analysis revealed that the ethanolic extract of the patented kinetic bio-activation fruiting body of AC contained seven marker triterpenoid ingredients, namely antcin A (at 74.7 min), antcin B (at 64.4 and 65.4 min), antcin C (at 42.2 and 45.7 min), antcin H (at 45.0 min), antcin K (at 20.1 and 21.0 min), dehydrosulphurenic acid (at 57.4 min) and dehydroeburicoic acid (at 84.9 min) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The total amount of the triterpenoids was observed to account for 14.5% (w/w) of the AC extract, and antcin C, antcin H, and antcin K were abundant among these triterpenoids (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Four groups were used in this study: (1) a normal group; (2) cancer group (tumor-alone group); (3) CGC group: mice treated with a standard diet and an intraperitoneal injection of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per 3 days) and cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/week); (4) CGCA group: mice treated with a standard diet plus AC extract (300 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and an intraperitoneal injection of gemcitabine and cisplatin. After orthotopic implantation of LLC2 cells into the lungs for two weeks, the mice were treated with different combinations of drugs for 21 days and were sacrificed to evaluate tumor progression. The number of tumor nodules and the lung weight reflecting the tumor growth were greatly reduced in the CGC and CGCA groups, compared with the cancer alone group. Furthermore, we observed that the anticancer activity of the CGCA group was stronger than that of the CGC group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The chemical components of the AC extract and its effects on lung tumor growth</title><p>The morphology of the fruiting bodies of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> (AC) and the representative HPLC profile of the ethanolic extract of AC <bold>(A)</bold>.

As expected, the muscle atrophy evaluated through histological examination was parallel with the trend of muscle mass loss in these groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Notably, the CGC group had the most skeletal muscle mass loss, as evidenced by a marked reduction in the weight of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, and this loss was inhibited by combined treatment with AC (CGCA) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

The current study demonstrates, for the first time, that combined treatment with the ethanolic extract of AC greatly alleviates gemcitabine and cisplatin-induced cachectic symptoms, including body weight loss, skeletal muscle atrophy, intestinal damage and dysfunction, and anorexia in lung tumor-bearing mice; this thus supports the clinical use of this extract. Myostatin belonging to transforming growth factor-&#x003b1;; (TGF-&#x003b1;) superfamily is mostly expressed in skeletal muscle, and it can inhibit skeletal muscle growth by reducing myoblast proliferation and myogenesis [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Conversely, blocking the actions of myostatin by using neutralizing antibodies or antagonists remarkably increases muscle size and physical strength [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, activins, members of the TGF-&#x003b1; superfamily, are another muscle atrophying factor. Notably, myostatin and activins can bind the same muscle surface receptor complex that composes of type-II activin receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) and type-I activin receptors (ALK4 and ALK5), which ultimately results in muscle proteolysis through activation of FoxO, especially the FoxO3 isoform. The actions of FoxO are largely controlled by the subcellular localization and the protein degradation of FoxO. When FoxO is phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt, the phosphorylated FoxO is exported from the nucleus into cytoplasma in a chaperone 14-3-3-dependent manner [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The 14-3-3 bound phosphorylated FoxO protein is then degraded through proteasome. In response to myostatin and activin, Akt activity is inhibited, leading to the accumulation of the dephospho-FoxO protein, the active form of FoxO. Subsequently, the activated FoxO translocates into the nucleus and enhances the transcription of muscle-specific atrogenic genes, such as MuRF-1 and MAFbx. Previous studies have reported that myostatin and activin signaling in muscle increases in patients with cancer suffering from cachexia and in experimental cancer cachexia [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated that the levels of muscle myostatin and activin were significantly reduced in the CGCA group, compared with those in the CGC group. An increase in ActRIIB expression and a decrease in Akt phosphorylation in the CGC group were also reversed by AC treatment, which may be associated with the inhibition of myostatin and activin generation. As expected, treatment with AC increased FoxO3 phosphorylation accompanied by an elevation of the association of 14-3-3 with phospho-FoxO3 in cytoplasma, but it significantly inhibited MuRF-1 and MAFbx expression, and proteasome activity. Collectively, suppressing the myostatin/activins/FoxO3/MuRF-1/MAFbx signaling pathway may contribute to the antiatrophic effect of AC.</p><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that systemic inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2;, are major factors in promoting muscle atrophy through UPS activation, muscle differentiation and myogenesis inhibition [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and improvement of anorexia during cancer cachexia [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were reported in patients with cachexia [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, neutralization of pro-inflammatory cytokines could markedly relieve the cachectic symptoms in an experimental animal model [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. According to the results that the CGCA group had lower serum levels of NF-&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-1&#x003b2; than that in the CGC group, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine formation may also involve the anti-cachectic effects of AC.</p><p>In addition to muscle proteolysis, muscle protein generation is another crucial factor in regulating muscle mass. A central role of IGF-1 in enhancing muscle growth by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR-regulated protein synthesis was demonstrated, previously [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, IGF-1 can activate Akt-induced FoxO phosphorylation, thereby attenuating muscle protein degradation [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, IGF-1 not only enhances protein synthesis but also inhibits muscle proteolysis, suggesting that IGF-1induction is a promising approach to prevent muscle atrophy. A novel finding of this study is that the CGCA group had a higher IGF-1 level in muscle than that of the CGC group. Accordingly, AC-mediated attenuation of muscle mass loss may, at least partly, be attributed to the suppression of inflammation-evoked muscle protein degradation, and enhancement of IGF-1-dependent protein synthesis.</p><p>Maintaining the intestinal structure and function is essential for nutritional intake and body growth. Notably, intestinal damage and impaired digestive enzyme activity, particularly in the CGC group, were greatly improved through AC treatment. Thus, increased nutrient absorption and availability due to the attenuation of intestinal injury and dysfunction may in turn enhance appetite, as reflected by increased daily food intake, thereby attenuating body weight loss by AC in this cachectic model. Notably, the inhibition of lung tumor growth through combined treatment with AC was stronger than that observed in the CGC group, suggesting that AC can also enhance the anticancer activity of chemotherapy.</p><p>Ergostane-type triterpenoids are the major bioactive components in the fruiting bodies of AC. Among these triterpenoids, antcin C, antcin H, antcin K, and antcin A have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The pharmacokinetic and metabolism study demonstrated that several triterpenoids and metabolites were detected in the plasma of rats after oral administration of the ethanol extract of AC (1g/kg). Generally, the ergostane triterpenoids are absorbed and eliminated rapidly, and the pharmacokinetic patterns of Antrodia triterpenoids are closely related to their chemical structure. The high-polarity of antcin H and antcin K were determined to be metabolically stable, and had markedly higher plasma concentrations than antcin B and antcin C [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Conversely, antcin A had a low concentration in plasma. Composition analysis revealed that antcin H and antcin K were abundant in the AC extract. Therefore, antcin K and antcin H may be most responsible for the therapeutic effects on cancer cachexia because of their pharmacokinetic parameters, abundance, and biological effects. However, more basic and human studies are required to determine their clinical use. Notably, the hydrogenated metabolites derived from antcin C also revealed a high plasma concentration. However, the biological functions are still unknown, and need further investigation.</p><p>In summary, AC administration can attenuate the development of cancer cachexia in lung tumor-bearing mice undergoing chemotherapy. Mechanically, the protective effects of AC against muscle wasting may be associated with the suppression of muscle proteolysis, formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of IGF-1-regulated protein synthesis, and improvement of intestinal damage and dysfunction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Overall, AC has potential to ameliorate cachectic symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The proposed mechanisms accounting for the anti-cachectic activity of the AC extract</title><p>Combined treatment with AC inhibits myostatin/activin/FoxO3 signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine formation, leading to the suppression of MAFbx and MuRF1 expression and proteasome activity in muscle, which in turn attenuates muscle proteolysis. Meanwhile, the AC extract enhances IGF-1 expression and its regulated protein synthesis, and improves anorexia and intestinal damage and dysfunction. Therefore, AC has potential to ameliorate cachectic symptoms under chemotherapy, especially body weight loss.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-09-19584-g006"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Preparation of AC extract and reagents</title><p>The fruiting bodies of AC were provided by Balay Biotechnology, Inc.

The animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principle in the Care and Use of Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Defense Medical Center (IACUC 12156). The mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine HCl/xylazine (100 mg/15 mg body weight per mouse). Anesthetized mice were placed on a platform by their front teeth so that their chests hung vertically beneath them. Light was directed on each mouse's upper chest, on a spot marked by an &#x0201c;X&#x0201d;. The mouth was opened using the Exel Safelet IV catheter, and the tongue is gently pulled out using flat forceps. After locating the white light emitted from the trachea, the Exel Safelet IV catheter was slid into the trachea, and the needle was removed. The mouse with the inserted catheter on the platform is moved into a biosafety hood, where the LLC2 cell (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/100 &#x003bc;L) was dispensed into the opening of the catheter [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
