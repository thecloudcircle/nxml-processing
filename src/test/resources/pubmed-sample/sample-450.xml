Intravaginal practices consist of a variety of behaviors, including wiping, cleansing, douching, or the insertion of over-the-counter products, such as sexual lubricants, into the vagina [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151378.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These behaviors can disturb the normal protective vaginal environment, which is based in part on hydrogen peroxide, lactobacillus, and pH. Such practices can affect intravaginal mucosal integrity and increase one&#x02019;s susceptibility to BV, STIs and HIV. For example, soaps used to wash the inside of the vagina can cause chemical damage and increase vaginal pH [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], contributing to the growth of organisms associated with BV [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. BV is the most common cause of vaginitis in women of reproductive age [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and a condition shown to increase women&#x02019;s risk of STI acquisition, including HIV [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Research from both the developed and developing world has shown that intravaginal practices are common, and influenced by complex social, cultural, and biological factors [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the majority of research on the motivations for these practices in the United States has focused on douching, which is generally thought of as the use of a pressurized solution to cleanse intravaginally, usually with a douching device. Currently little is known about the motivations for other types of intravaginal practices, such as the insertion of products into the vagina, among women in the United States. Through understanding the motivations for intravaginal practices among women in different populations, the public health community can develop effective counseling messages and interventions to encourage less harmful practices, and better support women&#x02019;s vaginal health.</p><p>In this paper we use data collected as part of a cohort study among women in the United States to contextualize the motivations for intravaginal washing and intravaginal insertion of products in a study population where data are lacking. The overall objectives of the cohort study were to (1) quantify the prevalence and frequency of vaginal and rectal practices and product use, (2) examine the associations between these practices and reproductive tract infections, and (3) describe the context and motivations for these practices among an ethnically diverse population. Results from objectives one and two have been published previously, where findings demonstrated an increased risk of BV associated with the intravaginal insertion of products [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The objective of this paper is to specifically address objective three and describe and compare the motivations for intravaginal washing and intravaginal insertion of products among women at the time of enrollment into the cohort, among African American, Latina, and Caucasian women. We hypothesized that intravaginal practices may differ by age, and across racial and ethnic groups. We report on those findings and discuss their implications for vaginal health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective cohort study was implemented by the University of California, Los Angeles, and the AIDS Research Alliance of America in Los Angeles, California between 2008 and 2010. A convenience sample of sexually active women aged 18&#x02013;65 years was selected through community education and outreach activities conducted by the AIDS Research Alliance staff in HIV/AIDS service organizations, women&#x02019;s health clinics, community-based organizations, and HIV testing sites in Los Angeles. Women greater than 18 years of age were invited to attend screening visits at the AIDS Research Alliance clinic and, if eligible, and willing to attend study visits, enrolled. Women were excluded if they planned to move from the area in the next 12 months.</p><p>To achieve an ethnically diverse sample, comprising of Los Angeles&#x02019; three major racial groups, where women and girls of color make up more than 70% of the County&#x02019;s female population [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we enrolled near equal numbers of participants who self-identified as non-Hispanic Caucasian, non-Hispanic African American or black, or Hispanic or Latina. Women who self-identified as Asian were eligible; however, few showed up to the clinic for screening. In total, four Asian women were enrolled but given that there were too few women in these categories to warrant a separate stratum, these women (none of which identified as Latina) were included in the race category &#x0201c;Non-hispanic White&#x0201d;. We saw no evidence of an effect on estimates in sensitivity analyses using this choice of categorization. The sample size for evaluating differences in motivation by ethnicity was based on feasibility rather than specific power calculations. It was estimated that a sample of 40&#x02013;50 women per ethnicity group would give us 80% power to identify moderate differences in reported motivations (&#x0003e;25%) between groups as statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review boards of the University of California, Los Angeles and the AIDS Research Alliance. All women provided informed consent prior to study participation. Participants were seen at the AIDS Research Alliance clinic at enrollment and then after 12 months. Data presented in this cross-sectional analysis are based only upon data obtained at enrollment. Additional details of the methods are described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>At enrollment, a structured, self-administered, computer-assisted questionnaire was used to collect all survey responses (Sensus 4.2, Sawtooth Technologies, Northbrook, Illinois). Skip patterns, logic and range checks were programmed into the computer-assisted questionnaire to ensure high quality data. Data on demographic factors (e.g., age, race and ethnicity), sexual behaviors, intravaginal practices, and motivations for intravaginal practices was collected. Women were specifically asked about types of and reasons for intravaginal practices over the previous year and during the last month, as well as during the last act of vaginal intercourse. We also asked women who taught them to wash intravaginally. In addition, questions on partner characteristics, contraceptive use, and vaginal symptoms were asked but given the scope of this analysis, are not described. Counseling was offered to women by study staff to help them distinguish between intravaginal practices (beyond the introitus) and practices that involved the external genitalia (e.g., mons pubis, vulva). Our survey questions adopted the classification framework from the World Health Organization (WHO) Gender, Sexuality and Vaginal Practices study to define intravaginal practices [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as either: 1) intravaginal washing, or 2) intravaginal insertion of products. Intravaginal washing included intravaginal cleaning on the inside of the vagina, beyond the introitus, with soap, commercially prepared solutions, or other household products, with or without douching devices. In contrast, the intravaginal insertion of products, comprised of the insertion of over-the-counter products (e.g., petroleum jelly, sexual lubricants, wet wipes) into the vagina, beyond the introitus, with or without an applicator. This typology is based on definitions of practices identified from an extensive, qualitative investigation and household surveys in four countries [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that has become standard among researchers in the field. Each woman completed the questionnaire on her own in a private room at the study site, and study staff were available outside the room to respond to questions, if needed. The questionnaire was available in both English and Spanish.</p><p>Data were analyzed using STATA 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Sociodemographics and the prevalence and types of intravaginal practices were tabulated. Proportions were calculated for binary measures and measures of tendency of dispersion (median, interquartile range, range) were described for continuous variables. Estimates were calculated overall, by participant age, and by race and ethnicity. Univariable associations between participants&#x02019; motivations for intravaginal practices (i.e., washing and product use), age, race and ethnicity, and type of products used are presented. Univariate differences in categorical variables between study groups were assessed using two-sided Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. A non-parametric test for trend was performed across age when meaningful differences were found. Due to small numbers of women reporting use of specific intravaginal products for specific reasons formal statistical testing to evaluate the difference in motivations for each type of product used was not performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec007"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred fifty women were screened and consented; of these 141 women were enrolled and completed the baseline questionnaire; nine women did not complete the baseline interview. Overall, data quality was high with no specific questions commonly left unanswered. There was no missing data for age, race, education, intravaginal practices, condom use, and sexual practices. Ninety-eight percent of the data on other variables were complete.</p><p>The median age of the women was 32 years (interquartile range 25&#x02013;44, range 18&#x02013;65 years). One third (34%) of women were Caucasian, 40% were African American, and 26% were Latina. Most of the women (87%) were born in the United States. The majority (89%) had completed at least a high school education. The median monthly income among women in this cohort was $750 [interquartile range $221&#x02013;1000, range $0&#x02013;4500].

We found that nearly half of women report washing inside the vagina and over half of women report inserting some type of over-the-counter product (other than tampons) inside the vagina over the past month. Women&#x02019;s intravaginal practices and their motivations for use differ across race and age categories, and motivations vary by type of intravaginal product used. While most women reported the use of commercial sexual lubricants, many also reported inserting petroleum jelly, lotion, oils, and wet wipes into the vagina to be ready for, or to increase the pleasure of vaginal sex. African American women were more likely to report use of products not designed for and potentially harmful upon insertion into the vagina, such as petroleum jelly, oils, and wet wipes. We found that most women wash intravaginally because they feel it is necessary for good hygiene. This finding is consistent with the findings of prior research [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Women also wash intravaginally to prepare for sex, and to clean up after sex, which also comports with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our study also found that half of women, particularly younger women, perceive that their male sexual partners want them to wash intravaginally, demonstrating the important influence of sexual partners on women&#x02019;s intravaginal practices in this cohort.</p><p>Prior research has found that Caucasian women learn intravaginal practices from electronic and print media [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, we found that few women learn these practices from the media. Instead, a significant proportion of women of all ages report learning to wash intravaginally from their mothers. African American women, in particular, are more likely to report learning to wash intravaginally from their mothers. Two studies among adult women living in the southeastern United States similarly reported that mothers were the most common source of encouragement about douching among African American women [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151378.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Most clinicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommend that women not wash or douche intravaginally [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Yet, in our study, approximately half of women aged 18&#x02013;65 years report intravaginal washing over the past month. Our finding that intravaginal washing is reported by between one half and two-thirds of African American women are supported by other published estimates in the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) in the U.S. estimates that 32% of women aged 15&#x02013;49 years practice douching, and over half (58.5%) of African American women report douching over the past year [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The somewhat higher overall prevalence of intravaginal washing in our study (45% vs. 32% in NSFG) could be related to the composition of the specific populations studied (we ensured one-third of the study population was African American vs. 8% of the cohort being African American in NSFG), the older age range of our study population (18&#x02013;65 years vs. 14&#x02013;49 years in the NSFG), the more recent time frame of our study (2010 vs. 2002 in NSFG), the way in which the interview was conducted (self-reported, private, computer-assisted interviews vs. in-person interviews in NSFG) or the way in which we asked about intravaginal washing. In our study, the definition of intravaginal washing was modeled on the WHO Gender Sexuality, and Vaginal Practices Study group classification for vaginal practices [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and defined as any insertion of a liquid into the vagina, beyond the introitus, with or without a douching device. In the NSFG, respondents were asked &#x02018;&#x0201c;During the past 12 months, how often, if at all, did you douche?&#x0201d;. It is possible that women do not equate all forms of intravaginal washing with douching, which is generally thought of as the use of a pressurized solution to cleanse intravaginally, usually with a douching device [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and this could have resulted in underreporting of intravaginal washing in the NSFG. These different definitions could account for some of the differences in prevalence, and also highlights the importance of using, where possible, definitions of intravaginal practices, products, and frequency that allow comparisons across populations and studies [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The strengths of this study lie in its design as an in-depth study of a variety of intravaginal practices including but not limited to douching in the United States. The comprehensiveness of the questionnaire allowed for a detailed evaluation of intravaginal practices among a cohort of women of diverse ages and ethnicities. The age and racial distribution of women who participated allowed us to examine differences between groups. The use of a self-administered questionnaire rather than an interviewer-administered questionnaire may have limited reporting bias of sensitive or stigmatized behaviors.</p><p>Limitations of this study were mainly due to its relatively small sample and the small numbers of women reporting certain types of intravaginal practices, which limited our ability to detect statistically significant associations. Furthermore, because of the sample selection and small sample size, results may not be generalizable to other groups. A purposive sample of women was chosen for this study not to be representative but rather to achieve balance across three major racial groups that comprise the majority of Los Angeles&#x02019; female population; Latinas make up the majority of the female population (47%), followed by white (28%), Asian Americans (14%) and African Americans (9%). However, a similar proportion of our sample completed at least a high school education (89%) compared to the approximately 84% of women in Los Angeles who have done so [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, we recognize that these findings may not reflect the population as a whole. Nonetheless, given the lack of published findings on intravaginal practices among women in the United States, our study is a valuable contribution to the literature that describes the frequency, distribution, and variability associated with intravaginal practices among an ethnically diverse population of women.</p><p>Understanding women&#x02019;s motivations for intravaginal practices is important because there is a growing body of international evidence suggesting that some intravaginal practices are harmful to women&#x02019;s health. For example, intravaginal washing is not beneficial for vaginal hygiene, and may be associated with increased risk for BV, pelvic inflammatory disease, and STIs, including HIV [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151378.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A meta-analysis among more than 10,000 HIV-negative women in sub-Saharan Africa found that intravaginal use of drying agents were associated with an increased risk of BV and HIV [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous studies in developed countries have found associations between intravaginal practices and prevalent vaginal infections [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151378.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] including our own study that found that women in this cohort from Los Angeles who reported intravaginal use of petroleum jelly were at increased risk for BV, taking into account vaginal symptoms, age, race, HIV status, and sexual activity [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Little is known about the possible effects of intravaginal product use on uptake or effectiveness of other HIV/STI prevention technologies. Because intravaginal practices appear to increase the risk of acquiring BV and HIV, the population-attributable risks and related costs could be large, especially in settings and populations in which these practices are most prevalent [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>This study illustrates that personal, sexual, relational, and social factors influence women&#x02019;s intravaginal practices and that these factors vary by race and age, and type of product. Additional, larger studies and in-depth qualitative analyses to further understand these important influences is essential for the development of interventions and counseling messages to improve vaginal health. Evolving evidence supports a multi-pronged approach to educating women and men about these common, and potentially deleterious intravaginal practices. First, we should develop appropriate public health messages to caution against harmful intravaginal practices. A pilot study among HIV-infected women in Zambia suggested that a behavioral intervention, involving an individual, interactive socio-educational session about intravaginal practices, could decrease these behaviors; communication with sexual partners regarding intravaginal practices was higher for women receiving the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Educational messages targeted toward or possibly delivered by influential sources of information, such as parents or male partners should also be considered. It will also be important to critically assess the regulation, testing, and labeling of over-the-counter products that are used intravaginally. In clinical settings, the link between intravaginal practices and poor reproductive health outcomes can be addressed by clinicians whenever a woman tests positive for pregnancy, BV, candidiasis, or an STI, by asking her about her vaginal practices [<xref rid="pone.0151378.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The detection of intravaginal practices could also be initiated by women&#x02019;s healthcare providers at family planning visits or through preventive counseling to prevent adolescent and young adult women from engaging in unsafe behaviors. With careful consideration of the underlying motivations that influence women&#x02019;s intravaginal practices, which vary across race, age, and product of choice, practitioners may develop effective counseling messages, interventions, and programs to better support women in choosing less harmful practices, and achieving vaginal health.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0151378.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Low</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chersich</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Schmidlin</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Egger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Francis</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>van de Wijgert</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
