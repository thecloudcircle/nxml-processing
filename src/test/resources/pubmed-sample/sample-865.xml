<italic>So-ochim-tang-gamibang</italic> (SOCG) is a decoction formula which has been used to improve mental activity in traditional Korean medicine.

SOCG was orally administered for the same period. mRNA expression in the hippocampus was analyzed by RT-PCR. Levels of serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR in the hippocampus were determined by western blotting and by immunofluorescence staining in coronal brain sections. Cultured neurons were prepared from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in mice to examine the effects of CRS and SOCG treatment on neurite outgrowth. Depressive-like behaviors of experimental animals were measured by open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">mRNA levels of serotonin 1A and 1B receptors (5-HT1AR and 5-HT1BR) were decreased in the hippocampus of CRS animals and increased by SOCG treatment. Signals of 5-HT1AR protein in CA3 pyramidal cells were decreased by CRS but elevated back to levels in control animals after SOCG treatment. Phospho-Erk1/2 protein in CA3 cells showed similar pattern of changes as in 5-HT1AR, suggesting coordinated regulation after SOCG treatment in CRS animals. Axonal growth-associated protein GAP-43 levels were also decreased by CRS and then increased by SOCG treatment. In vivo administration of SOCG improved neurite outgrowth of primary DRG neurons from CRS animals and also increased 5-HT1AR protein signals. Behavioral tests of open field and forced swimming showed that immobility time periods were significantly decreased by SOCG treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our data suggest that SOCG treatment may increase synaptic responsiveness to serotonergic neuronal inputs by upregulating 5-HT1AR in the hippocampal neurons.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>So-ochim-tang-gamibang</kwd><kwd>Serotonin receptor</kwd><kwd>Hippocampus</kwd><kwd>Chronic restraint stress</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea</institution></funding-source><award-id>HI13C0493</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>In Chul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Depression is a mental illness that causes a serious disability of the quality of life and affects about 20% of the population worldwide. Because of its subjectivity and qualitative nature, there has been a limitation to characterize the neurobiological basis on depression. However, recent advances in brain imaging techniques have identified the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala as susceptible brain areas to depressive illness in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Studies using experimental animals indicate that the intense, chronic stress activates the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis, and consequently elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels cause neuronal atrophy in several brain areas.</p><p id="Par13">Hippocampal granule cells and pyramidal cells establish a trisynaptic circuit which is primarily glutaminergic. Major inputs to hippocampus are given from the entorhinal cortex through the perforant path, and the findings of the long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons after high frequency stimulation of the perforant path have paved a way to explore the physiological basis of learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hippocampus has not only a bilateral connection to amygdala, but also relays the output to several brain areas including the mammillary body and the septum through the fornix, and receives the synaptic inputs through the cingulate cortex. Thus, hippocampal activity is affected by stressful state, and, particularly in the state of stress-induced depression, the responsiveness of hippocampal neurons can be altered to serotonergic and adrenergic inputs as well as corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Here, blockers or modulators of receptors against serotonin, norepinephrine and CRH have been the primary therapeutic targets for the development of antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In traditional Korean medicine, depression is described as a congested state of <italic>qi</italic> and thus, the therapeutic approach for depression is to refurbish its flow by using herbal drugs and acupuncture. <italic>So-o-chim-tang-gami-bang</italic> (SOCG) is a modified herbal formulation of <italic>So-o-chim-tang</italic> by substituting <italic>Aquilaria agallocha Roxb</italic> with <italic>Aucklandia lappa</italic> and supplementing <italic>Citrus aurantum</italic> and <italic>Platycodon grandifloras</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is described in <italic>Dongui Bogam</italic>, a classical Korean medicinal book, that <italic>So-o-chim-tang</italic> is effective in treating abnormal regulation of <italic>qi</italic> leading to pain of internal organ, and <italic>Citrus aurantum</italic> and <italic>Platycodon grandiflorus</italic> reinforce the flow of <italic>qi</italic> to head and neck. We have shown previously that SOCG treatment in cultured mast cells decreased the expressions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 mRNAs and increased free radical-scavenging activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We further demonstrated that SOCG treatment in CRS animal model reduced corticosterone levels in the serum and induced the improvement from immobility behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, it was reported that specific chemical ingredients or herbal components of SOCG were effective in regulating depressive- or anxiety-like behaviors in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">While these studies strongly suggest that SOCG may play a role in regulating depressive-like behavior, studies on the role of SOCG in specific brain areas have not been reported. Based on the hypothesis that, in the nervous system, the facilitated <italic>qi</italic> flow would be positively linked to the increased signaling through the neural circuit, the effects of SOCG on the regulation of the <italic>qi</italic> flow and depression may be explored in terms of SOCG-mediated neuronal activation in brain tissues. Here, we investigated, by using CRS animal model, the effects of SOCG on hippocampal neuronal responses. Our data suggest that the activation of 5-HT1AR is involved in mediating SOCG effects on hippocampal neurons in animals of depressive-like state. The effects of SOCG were also seen from 5-HT1AR-positive neurons displaying enhanced neurite outgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Extraction of SOCG</title><p id="Par16">Herbal drug components of SOCG were obtained from Dongkyung Pharmaceutical Company (Seoul, Korea). Preparation procedure and chemical profile of SOCG have been described in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Briefly, for water extraction, a total of 11&#x000a0;g of SOCG, which is composed of 4&#x000a0;g of <italic>Cyperi Rhizoma (Cyperus rotundus L.)</italic>, 2&#x000a0;g each of <italic>Linderae Radix (Lindera aggregata (Sims) Kosterm.), Platycodi Radix (Platycodon grandiflorum (Jacq.)

After freezing-frying, 1.6&#x000a0;g of the SOCG powder was obtained from 11&#x000a0;g of initial raw materials (14.6% of extraction ratio). SOCG powder was dissolved in purified water, filtered by using 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m Whatman filter paper (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, USA) and stored at -20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C as a stock solution (10&#x000a0;mg/ml) which was further diluted with saline solution (0.9% NaCl in water) for oral administration. Voucher specimens (No. 194A079&#x02013;85) of collected herb samples were deposited in the herbarium of Han Kook Shin Yak Co., Ltd.

Before the experiments, animals were acclimatized for 7&#x000a0;days in an animal room and were allowed to eat commercial pellet chow (Samyang Co., Seoul, Korea) and drink water ad libitum. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: an intact animal control group (CTL), a chronic restraint stress with saline injection as a SOCG vehicle (CRS), and CRS plus 100&#x000a0;mg/kg and 300&#x000a0;mg/kg of SOCG-treated groups (CRS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SOCG100 and CRS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SOCG300). To induce a depressive-like state, individual animals were subject to CRS by placing in a well-ventilated 50&#x000a0;ml conical tube for 6&#x000a0;h each day for 14 consecutive days. SOCG (100 and 300&#x000a0;mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline was orally administered using a 22-gauge oral needle 2&#x000a0;h before CRS on a daily basis for a 2&#x000a0;week period. A recommended daily dose of SOCG for human is 3.2&#x000a0;g (Han Kook Shin Yak Co., Ltd.), which is then calculated 658&#x000a0;mg/kg for the use of experimental animals according to a procedure of human equivalent dose calculation (Guideline by the Food and Drug Administration, USA). However, to determine drug efficacy, we adopted a range of lower dose as much as 50% or less for a current investigation. Our recent study also indicates that SOCG doses at 100&#x000a0;mg/kg and 300&#x000a0;mg/kg are optimal for the induction of depressive-like behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p id="Par30">SOCG is a modified prescription of <italic>So-o-chim-tang</italic>, and has been used in Korean traditional medicine for the treatment of congested vital energy. According to traditional medicinal theory, a prolonged stagnation of <italic>qi</italic> and blood flow and unbalance of yin-yang cause the symptom of depression. Thus, SOCG or some modified decoctions of SOCG have been prescribed in traditional medicinal therapy. However, the biological basis on its efficacy is largely unknown, and only recently has the potential effect on depressive-like disorders begun to be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Here, we extended the effects of SOCG on the regulation of molecular factors that may be involved in neuronal activities in the hippocampus of CRS animals.</p><p id="Par31">Hippocampus has neural inputs from the entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, brainstem reticular formation, and others, and sends out efferents to mammillary body through fornix, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and cingulate gyrus. Brain imaging studies indicate a reduction of hippocampal volume in patients with manic depressive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and hippocampal volume was reported to increase in patient after 3&#x000a0;years of antidepressant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Extensive, chronic stress can cause depressive disorder. Here, stress abnormally regulates the HPA axis, and leads to increased release of glucocorticoid, which in turn may affect adversely on the survival of hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Besides glucocorticoid, hippocampus receives serotonergic and adrenergic inputs mainly from the brainstem reticular formation, and their potential role for the regulation of anxiety and depression has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">CRS elevates serum corticosterone through the activation of HPA axis. During chronic stress state, CRH mediates neuronal activation by acting on their receptors in addition to stimulation of ACTH secretion in the pituitary gland. Two main types of CRH receptors, CRF1 and CRF2, are known to be functionally involved in the regulation of stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. CRF1 and CHF2 as well as CRH are expressed in hippocampal neurons, and are involved in activation of hippocampal neurons in response to stress. Here, prolonged, external stress signals such as glucocorticoid and neuronal inputs from the amygdala could augment hippocampal neuronal responses and may cause structural and functional alterations of hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It was further reported that the activation of CRF1 can mediate anxiolytic and anxiogenic properties between forebrain glutaminergic and midbrain dopaminergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We found clear expression of CRF1 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA in the hippocampus, but no changes were observed by CRS. Yet, CRF2 mRNA levels were increased by CRS and downregulated by SOCG. It was previously reported that hippocampal expression of CRF1 and CRF2 was moderate and similar among hippocampal subfields though slight variation was noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further studies are required to define the significance of CRS-induced CRF2 in the hippocampus and the role of intervention of SOCG.</p><p id="Par33">Previous studies have documented that activation of serotonergic pathway in the brain plays an important role in regulating depressive disorder, as is widely recognized by the clinical use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There are several types of serotonin receptors expressed in brain regions including raphe nucleus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, septum, amygdala, and others, and activation of some serotonin receptors have antidepressant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Notably, 5-HT1AR in the hippocampus and cortex was shown to be required for developmental regulation of anxiety-like behavior and antidepressant response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Studies using agonist of serotonin 1A receptor or gene knockout animals reported the involvement of hippocampal serotonergic neuronal activity in behavioral expression of anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, activation of serotonine1B receptor in the brain via the interaction with p11 was positively linked to behavioral rescue by antidepressant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Here our data show that, unlike CRF and glucocorticoid receptor, 5-HT1A and 1B receptors were largely decreased by CRS and increased again by SOCG. Since the changes of 5-HT1AR expression was more dramatic than 5-HT1BR, we focused our study on 5-HT1AR in the hippocampal subfields. While 5-HT1AR signals were found in major subfields, signals in the CA3 area were detected in the cell layer and striatum radiatum. Interestingly, 5-HT1AR signals were largely decreased by CRS and regained by SOCG treatment. To understand possible signaling events related to 5-HT1AR upregulation in CA3 neurons by SOCG treatment in CRS animals, we examined phopsho-Erk1/2 levels in the hippocampal neurons. It was noted that the pattern of upregulation of phospho-Erk1/2 by SOCG treatment was similar to that of hippocampal 5-HT1AR protein signals. 5-HT1AR and phospho-Erk1/2 signals in CA3 area were commonly observed in striatum radiatum where the synaptic inputs of mossy fibers are delivered. Activation of 5-HT1AR in response to serotonergic neuronal inputs can induce intracellular signaling events via the activation of phospho-Erk1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus in SOCG-treated animals, CA3 neuronal activation via 5-HT1AR signaling may contribute to the reorganization of neural circuit in the brain.</p><p id="Par34">GAP-43 is a neural protein that has been expressed in many brain tissues although it is inducible in neurons undergoing development and axonal regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Given the notion that GAP-43 expression in adult hippocampus is related to synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], it is conceivable that its expression may be downregulated in animals with depression because depression may reflect an alteration in the organization of neural circuits in the brain. While overall GAP-43 protein in the hippocampal tissue was consistent without any conspicuous change after CRS, significant upregulation was induced by SOCG treatment. In CA3 area, neuronal GAP-43 signals were detected in the inner- and outer pyramidal layers. Since GAP-43 protein is selectively transported into axons, it is likely that GAP-43 signals in this region may be localized in axons (e.g., commissural fibers) transmitting synaptic inputs to CA3 neurons and axons from hilus region, but not mossy fibers (see below). GAP-43 in the dentate gyrus showed clear signals in the outer molecular layers of the dentate gyrus, but no signals were observed in granule cells and thus no GAP-43 in its axons (mossy fiber). It is thus speculated that incoming fibers (perforant path) from entorhinal cortex in SOCG&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CRS animals may have an augmented synaptic connectivity to dentate granule cells possibly by involving hilar interneurons, which in turn, relay enhanced outputs to CA3 neurons. CA3 neurons, also showing increased GAP-43 expression, could enhance synaptic plasticity in its connectivity to the targets such as CA1 neurons and contralateral neurons.</p><p id="Par35">Since we found induction of GAP-43 in hippocampal neurons by SOCG, we reasoned that there may be a commonality in the responsiveness of neurons in both central and peripheral nervous systems. To this end, DRG neurons prepared from CRS and CRS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SOCG animals were analyzed. In CRS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SOCG animal group, length of neurite was significantly increased and 5-HT1AR signals were increased as well. Sciatic nerve axons can regenerate after injury and induce GAP-43 expression strongly in regenerating axons. In parallel, DRG neurons, which were prepared from animals undergone sciatic nerve injury for 3&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days, represent enhanced neurite outgrowth and increased GAP-43 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which is interpreted as transcriptional activation of regeneration-related target genes in response to retrograde lesion signals from the peripheral injury site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our data showed that DRG neurons prepared from animals given &#x02018;preconditioned&#x02019; peripheral nerve injury showed increased expression of 5-HT1AR in addition to GAP-43, suggesting that SOCG-mediated signaling evens mediated by 5-HT1AR and GAP-43 expression may be related to growth processes of neural circuits in the hippocampus. Thus, we conclude that SOCG activates the signaling events in the hippocampal neurons of CRS animals. Consequent activation of hippocampal neuronal circuit may contribute to behavioral rescue as anxiolytic effects by activating limbic system. This notion is supported by our data demonstrating an improvement of depressive-like behavior by SOCG treatment. Further studies on SOCG may have a great potential in developing therapeutic strategies as well as for the exploration of mechanistic basis on its action.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>5-HT1AR</term><def><p id="Par5">Serotonin 1A receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5-HT1BR</term><def><p id="Par6">Serotonin 1B receptors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF1</term><def><p id="Par7">Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF2</term><def><p id="Par8">Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 2 receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRS</term><def><p id="Par9">Chronic restraint stress</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sciatic nerve injury</term><def><p id="Par10">SNI</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOCG</term><def><p id="Par11">So-ochim-tang-gamibang</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all members in the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at Daejeon University.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par36">This study was supported by a grant of the Traditional Korean Medicine R&#x00026;D Project, Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea.
