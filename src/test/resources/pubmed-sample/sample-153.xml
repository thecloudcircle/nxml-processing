Oral administration of drugs is one of the most common approaches. It has many advantages in comparison with intravenous rout, such as better safety, ease of administration, lower cost, convenience and patient compliance.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The common regimen for chemotherapy consists of the administration of anticancer drugs through i.v. injection or infusion. The poor physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of various anticancer drugs and biological barriers in the GI tract restrict the oral administration of these drugs.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Utilizing pharmaceutical approaches, such as nanocarriers can improve the oral absorption of such drugs.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>
Polymeric nanoparticles, particularly chitosan nanoparticles have special features that can improve the oral absorption of drugs. Chitosan is the polycationic derivative of chitin with mucopolysaccharide structure similar to cellulose.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Chitosan nanoparticles have many advantages over natural polymers. The preparation methods of chitosan nanoparticles are simple and mild, and the resulting particles have good stability, and low toxicity&#x000a0;(LD50&#x0003e;16g/kg).&#x000a0;This nanoparticles can be used for different purposes. Hence, they are being considered as a drug delivery carrier, especially in recent years. Chitosan has a linear structure with a number of free amine groups, and can easily form ionic cross-linkage with multivalent anions.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The mucoadhesive properties of chitosan increase the contact time of a drug with the absorption site, leading to increased absorption. This property is based on the interaction between the positive charge of the chitosan and the negative charge of the mucin in the intestine.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, many studies have shown that chitosan can affect the tight junctions and induce their temporary opening, which increases the permeation of drugs through the intestinal epithelium.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The effect of chitosan and its derivatives on the oral absorption of some anticancer drugs has been studied.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>
Dox is an anticancer drug with excellent properties, which is being used to treat several malignancies, such as lymphoma, osteosarcoma and other sarcomas, carcinomas, and melanoma.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Dox is an anthracycline glycoside antibiotic that inhibits the DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Dox is one of the essential drugs in cytotoxic and adjuvant medicine of 20<sup>th</sup> WHO essential medicine list (EML) for adult and 6<sup>th</sup> for children. It is administered through IV infusion. However, there is the possibility of unwanted side effects due to high initial concentration or its toxicity followed by fast decay if its administered below the minimum therapeutic level.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> A relatively longer systemic exposure time with less fluctuation, can lead to lower toxicity and improved efficacy, which can be provided by oral delivery of this drug.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>
During this project chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by ionic gelation method and the effect of some parameters, such as polymer concentration, poly anionic agent concentration, mixing speed, etc. on particle size were analyzed. Dox was loaded in the selected nanoparticles, and the intestinal permeability studies were carried out by intestinal sac model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>
Low-molecular weight chitosan and pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) were purchased from a domestic supplier of Sigma-Aldrich (USA) in Iran. Doxorubicin hydrocloride was obtained as a 2mg/ml solution in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride from EBEWE Pharma (Austria). All other chemicals, solvents and reagents used were of chemical or analytical grade as needed, which were used without further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized water.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>
Preparation of Dox loaded chitosan nanoparticles</title><p>
Chitosan nanoparticles loaded Dox (Dox-Cs-NPs) were prepared using an ionic gelation method. Nanoparticles were formed spontanously, by dropwise adding of TPP aqueous solution to the chitosan aqueous solution (in 1% v/v acetic acid) under stirring at room temperature. Probe sonicator or magnet stirrer were used to mix chitosan and TPP solutions. The effect of chitosan and TPP solutions concentration, and different mixing methods on the particle size and size distribution were analyzed. Selected formulations with the particle size less than 300 nm <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and narrow size distribution were used for loading experiments. Dox was added into chitosan solution at different drug: polymer ratio (w:w) prior to adding TPP solution. The suspension was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 30 min, and sedimented nanoparticles were washed with deionized water and lyophilized before storage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>

Particle size and particle shape analysis</title><p>
Nanoparticle sizes were determined using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (Microtrac, Nano-flex 180&#x000b0;, USA) at room temperature.</p><p>
The shape and surface characteristics of the nanoparticles were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TESCAN vega3,Czech).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>
Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency</title><p>
The encapsulation efficiency of Dox-Cs-NPs was determined by indirect method. Dox-Cs-NPs were separated from the suspension by ultracentrifugation (Hettich, Model Mikro220R, Germany) at 15000 rpm and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The amount of free Dox in the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The encapsulation efficiency (EE) was calculated by equation 1:</p><p>

Where F is the free amount of drug in the supernatant, T is the total amount of drug added into the chitosan solution, and W is the weight of Dox-Cs-NPs. All formulations were carried out in triplicate.</p><p>
The chromatographic system for Dox analysis consist of a Hichrom C18 column (250 &#x000d7; 4 mm, UK) and a Cecil instrument (Adept series and CE 4200 UV/Vis Detector, England). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile: distilled water (30:70 v/v) and the pH of the mobile phase adjusted to 3 using phosphoric acid. The flow rate was set to 1 mL/min and Dox was quantified at 233 nm. The HPLC method validation showed the linearity of method (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9993) in the range of 1&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g/ mL. CV% was less than 9% and the accuracy was more than 88% within this range of concentrations (1&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g/ mL). The specificity was tested in the presence of the nanoparticles components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3"><title>
In vitro drug release study </title><p>
Profile of Dox release from the nanoparticles was analyzed in three different pH values of 5.0, 6.8 and 7.4 in phosphate buffer solution. Dox-Cs-NPs were suspended in 0.5 mL buffer solution in the microtubes. The tubes were put into shaker incubator (BIOER Mixing Block MB-102, China) and temperature was set to 37&#x000b0;C. At scheduled time points, the nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min, and the released drug in the supernatant was measured by HPLC method as described earlier. Following supernatant decantation, the same volume of fresh pre-warmed buffer solution was replaced. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The release percentage at each time was calculated and cumulative released curves are depicted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>
Analysis of release data</title><p>
To describe the drug release mechanism, release data were analyzed using the Ritger and Peppas equation:</p><p>

To assay the release kinetic, data were evaluated by zero order, first order, and Higuchi model. For zero order release kinetic, the cumulative percent of released drug versus time was assessed. In the cases of first order kinetic and Higuchi model, the logarithm of the amounts of the remaining drug to be released versus time, and the cumulative percent of released drug versus square root of time were evaluated, respectively. The relevant correlation coefficients were used to determine the best model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>
Intestinal permeation studies by intestinal sac model</title></sec><sec id="s2-3-5"><title>
Preparation of everted intestinal sac</title><p>
Permeation of free Dox and Dox loaded chitosan nanoparticles across the intestinal wall was studied. Everted and normal intestinal sacs were prepared according to the standard procedure.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (250-300g) were used for the intestinal permeation experiments. Animals were sacrificed and a longitudinal segment as long as 30 cm of the upper section of intestine was removed and rinsed with cold oxygenated physiological Ringer solution and cut into segments of 2 cm length. Each sac tied to a cotton thread and filled with 2 mL Ringer solution. For everting the intestine segment a glass rod was carefully used and the serosal side of the intestine was filled with 0.5 mL Ringer solution (acceptor part). Sacs were placed in a jacket glass tubes containing 40 mL physiologic Ringer solution that were continually bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> kept at 37&#x000b0;C (donor chamber).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-6"><title>
Intestinal permeation </title><p>
After equilibration at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 min, the exact volume of Dox solution or nanosuspension of Dox-Cs-NPs were added to the donor chamber. At scheduled time points after adding the drug to the donor chamber five intestinal sacs were removed. The liquid inside the sacs were centrifuged and analyzed with HPLC method. In the case of adding Dox-Cs-NPs to the donor chamber, the liquid inside the sacs at first was treated with acetic acid 1% and then ultrasonicated for 45 min to dissolve chitosan and to extract the entrapped drug within the nanoparticles. Finally, the solution was centrifuged and analyzed with HPLC.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>
Preparation of Dox-Cs-NPs</title><p>
Preparation of chitosan nanoparticles was performed by using various concentrations of chitosan (0.2-0.5mg/mL) and TPP solutions (0.2-0.5mg/mL).<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared through ionic gelation technique. This method is based on electrostatic interaction between the positive charge of amine groups of chitosan and negative charge groups of polyanion, such as tripolyphosphate. This technique is simple and performed in the aqueous medium. By adding TPP to the chitosan solution, nanoparticles were spontaneously formed during stirring at room temperature. For mixing the nanosuspension the effects of magnetic stirring and ultrasonic wave on the particle size and size distribution were analyzed. The results of particle size are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Dispersion of the NPs with probe sonicator was much better than magnetic stirrer, and the homogenisity of the particle size improved when probe sonicator was used.</p><p>

In vitro drug release</title><p>
The release profile of Dox from Dox-Cs-NPs at three different pH values is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. A quick release was seen from Dox-Cs-NPs in the first 6 hrs (approximately 30% of the drug was released at pH 5.0) and a relatively slow and sustained release was observed in the following days. By decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 5.0, the percentage of the released drug increased, but by changing the pH of the release medium to 6.8 the amount of drug released was reduced. The amount of drug released at acidic condition (pH 5.0) was greater than other pHs. This phenomenon is suitable for drug release at tumor region.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Another positive aspect of these nanoparticles is the release profile at pH 6.8. At this pH, the lowest amount of drug was released. Since in the <italic>in vivo</italic> condition the range of intestine pH is similar to this point, the Dox-Cs-NPs will have slight release before absorption. These differences in the release behavior at three pH media could be explained as the influence of protonation of amine groups of Dox, chitosan and changing the solubility of drug and polymer in these conditions.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>

</p><p>
According to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> the release of Dox from chitosan nanoparicles occurred in 2 different manners. At first, a fast release profile was observable showing that some part of Dox was absorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles and this part was released at the beginning up to the first 6 hrs showing a burst release, and the second part of the drug could be released up to 96 hrs from the beginning. In this regards release kinetics were assessed in two different time intervals. Release kinetic was evaluated for 0-6 hrs and 6-96 hrs, separately. Release kinetic was calculated by data fitting to zero order, first order, Higuchi model, and Ritger and Peppas equation. The relevant correlation coefficients were used to determine the best model (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to the results, the drug release followed the Higuchi model. The mechanism of drug release is highly related to the pH. It seems that Fickian diffusion at pH 5.0 and anomalous mechanism (Fickian diffusion and polymer relaxation) at pH 7.4 and 6.8 are the major drug release mechanisms. In addition, erosion of the chitosan nanoparticles at pH 6.8 is also involved.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>
Intestinal permeation</title><p>
To evaluate the role of chitosan nanoparticles in the intestinal permeation of Dox, everted rat gut sac technique was employed. This is a simple and accurate model.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Permeation of Dox from simple solution and Dox-Cs-NPs across the everted and not- everted gut is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. The transport of Dox encapsulated in the nanoparticles was significantly higher than the free Dox (approximately12.7 folds). When Dox solution was placed at the mucosal surface of intestine, the very low amount of drug (7%) transported across the intestinal wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). In spite of the proper log P of Dox (log P=1.3) for diffusion across the intestinal wall, presence of P-glycoprotein pumps (P-gp pumps) as an efflux pumps in the luminal part of the enterocytes could show this discrepancy. In contrast, Dox can diffuse from the serosal site to mucosal site of intestine. Assessment of the Dox loaded Cs-NPs permeation via everted gut and bypassing the P-gp pump showed that permeation of the drug will be increased profoundly up to 89% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). The presence of chitosan nanoparticles increased the intestinal permeation of Dox approximately by 12.7 folds. This observation also showed that when Dox is entrapped into the chitosan nanoparticles, it is not available for P-gp pumps and can be transported across the intestinal wall. In addition, this significant increase in the intestinal permeation could be explained by the effect of chitosan on the opening of tight junctions and facilitation of the paracellular transport of Dox. However, in the not everted gut experiment, simple diffusion of drug was inhibited by entrapping the drug into the nanoparticles. Therefore, no Dox could be transport from serosal to mucosal site.</p><p>
