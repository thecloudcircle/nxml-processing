Methylglyoxal (MGO), a metabolite of glycolysis, is increased in patients with diabetes. This study defined the role of MGO in angiogenesis impairment and tested the mechanism in diabetic animals. Endothelial cells and mouse aortas were subjected to Western blot analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) protein levels and angiogenesis evaluation by endothelial cell tube formation/migration and aortic ring assays. Incubation with MGO reduced VEGFR2 protein, but not mRNA, levels in a time and dose dependent manner. Genetic knockdown of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) attenuated the reduction of VEGFR2. Overexpression of Glyoxalase 1, the enzyme that detoxifies MGO, reduced the MGO-protein adducts and prevented VEGFR2 reduction. The VEGFR2 reduction was associated with impaired angiogenesis. Suppression of autophagy either by inhibitors or siRNA, but not of the proteasome and caspase, normalized both the VEGFR2 protein levels and angiogenesis. Conversely, induction of autophagy either by rapamycin or overexpression of LC3 and Beclin-1 reduced VEGFR2 and angiogenesis. MGO increased endothelial LC3B and Beclin-1, markers of autophagy, which were accompanied by an increase of both autophagic flux (LC3 punctae) and co-immunoprecipitation of VEGFR2 with LC3. Pharmacological or genetic suppression of peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) generation not only blocked the autophagy but also reversed the reduction of VEGFR2 and angiogenesis. Like MGO-treated aortas from normglycemic C57BL/6J mice, aortas from diabetic db/db and Akita mice presented reductions of angiogenesis or VEGFR2. Administration of either autophagy inhibitor <italic>ex vivo</italic> or superoxide scavenger <italic>in vivo</italic> abolished the reductions. Taken together, MGO reduces endothelial angiogenesis through RAGE-mediated, ONOO<sup>&#x02013;</sup>dependent and autophagy-induced VEGFR2 degradation, which may represent a new mechanism for diabetic angiogenesis impairment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an NIH Grant (P20 RR 024215-05) from the COBRE Program of the National Center for Research Resources, a National Scientist Development Grant (10SDG2600164) from the American Heart Association, a Junior Faculty Award (1-12-JF-58) from the American Diabetes Association, and a Research Award (HR11-200) from the Oklahoma Center for Advancement of Science and Technology (all to J.X.).

Angiogenesis impairment operates in the peripheral vasculature contributing to delayed wound healing, exacerbated peripheral limb ischemia, and even cardiac mortality via reduction of collateral vessel development <xref rid="pone.0046720-Duh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mechanisms underlying diabetic angiogenesis impairment are complex. Multiple molecular mechanisms have been proposed, including oxidative stress/reactive oxygen species, endothelial derangements, loss of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity, and micro RNA alterations <xref rid="pone.0046720-Leeper1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, it has not been completely elucidated how diabetes impairs physiological angiogenesis.</p><p>VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2, or kinase-insert domain receptor, KDR/fetal liver kinase, Flk-1) first identified in 1991 <xref rid="pone.0046720-Terman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, is produced within the cell and expressed on the cell surface as a matured 230 kD form (between 200&#x02013;250 kD) of protein pending on levels of glycosylation <xref rid="pone.0046720-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In an intact cell, VEGFR2 binds certain members of the VEGF family <xref rid="pone.0046720-MacGabhann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> through dimerization and strong ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, which results in a mitogenic, chemotactic, and pro-survival signal <xref rid="pone.0046720-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. VEGFR2 serves as the principal receptor for VEGF signaling <xref rid="pone.0046720-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> that leads to vasodilatation, endothelial cell migration, and proliferation <xref rid="pone.0046720-Olsson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. VEGFR2-KO mice are embryonic lethal (at E8.5&#x02013;9.5) with defective blood-island formation and vasculogenesis suggesting that VEGFR2 signaling is required for cardiovascular development <xref rid="pone.0046720-Shalaby1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Cell migration signals are recently shown to use, at least partly, a pathway dependent on an adaptor region of VEGFR2 <xref rid="pone.0046720-Shibuya1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Endothelial cells respond to VEGF to produce new blood vessels. This angiogenic process makes a critical contribution during embryogenesis and in the response to ischemia in adult tissues <xref rid="pone.0046720-Tiwari1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Manickam1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Bruns1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Gampel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. VEGF resistance has been recently observed in diabetic angiogenesis which is attribute to monocytic VEGFR1 down-regulation <xref rid="pone.0046720-Waltenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The observation suggests that components or downstream targets of VEGF signaling, such as VEGFR2, could be missing or dysfunctional in diabetes. In fact, VEGFR2 protein reduction has been observed in patients with diabetes <xref rid="pone.0046720-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Sasso1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and in experimental diabetic animals <xref rid="pone.0046720-Jesmin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The mechanism underlying VEGFR2 reduction and the contributions to angiogenesis impairment in diabetes are not known.</p><p>Methylglyoxal (MGO) is the major source of intracellular advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) <xref rid="pone.0046720-Karachalias1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. It is a highly reactive &#x003b1;-oxoaldehyde being formed primarily from the intermediates of glycolysis in cells <xref rid="pone.0046720-Baynes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

MGO can be detoxified efficiently by Glyoxalase (Glo) 1 <xref rid="pone.0046720-Thornalley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

To exclude potential off-target effects of MTX, we employed a genetic approach with siRNA to knockdown Glo1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Like MTX, Glo1 siRNA, but not the control, reduced VEGFR2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The reduction was further enhanced when MGO was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). To further confirm that the effect was MGO-specific, we quantified the levels of MGO-protein adduct in the treated cells by ELISA. As depicted, MGO vs control increased intracellular MGO-protein adducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Knockdown of Glo1 alone elevated MGO-protein adducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>); such an effect was dramatically strengthened in MGO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Next, we infected the cells with a Glo1-containing plasmid, using the cells infected with an empty plasmid as control. In line with the previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>/B, 2C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046720.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), MGO reduced VEGFR2 protein levels in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>); however, the reduction was absent in Glo1-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Similarly, MGO augmented MGO-protein adduct levels in the control-plasmid but not the Glo1-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). Finally, we asked whether the effect of MGO required RAGE, the receptor for AGE. We choose to check VEGFR2 protein levels after the RAGE was knockdown. As expected, the RAGE protein staining was reduced in RAGE- but not control-siRNA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Importantly, the otherwise reduction of VEGFR2 was markedly prevented (around 80%) when RAGE was knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>), suggesting a dominant role of RAGE in the studied effects of MGO.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, pre-incubation with chloroquine (CQ), a widely recognized inhibitor for autophagy and lysosome, prevented VEGFR2 protein reduction. Other lysosome/autophagy inhibitors, such as pepstatin A (Pep A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) showed similar protective effects.

As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, MGO reduced VEGFR2 protein levels in the control-siRNA-infecting BAEC, as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>); however, Beclin-1 siRNA infection decreased Beclin-1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>) and prevented VEGFR2 protein reduction by MGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).

However, respective pre-incubation with MG132, epoxomicin, and lactacystin, the structurally unrelated inhibitors of proteasome, could not block the reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>), although VEGFR2 can be a proteasome target <xref rid="pone.0046720-Murdaca1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>; pre-incubation with z-VAD-fmk (z-VAD), a broad caspase inhibitor, also did not prevent the reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Next we wondered whether MGO affected VEGFR2 at the transcriptional level. To answer this question, we performed RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA levels of VEGFR2 in the presence of MGO. As shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046720.s003">Fig. S3</xref>, MGO at indicated time and dose did not change VEGFR2 mRNA levels; similar results were obtained in other settings where Glo1 was manipulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046720.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

<sup>&#x02013;</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study provided evidence to demonstrate that MGO, a glycolysis metabolite found increased in patients with diabetes, impairs endothelial angiogenesis both in cell culture and aortic tissues. This is operative through ONOO<sup>&#x02013;</sup>dependent and autophagy-mediated VEGFR2 degradation, because pharmaceutical and genetic approaches that inhibit either autophagy or ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> formation reverse the MGO-mediated impacts. Importantly, the same approaches both <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> restored the angiogenic response or VEGFR2 protein levels in diabetic aortas, suggesting a previously unidentified mechanism for angiogenesis impairment in diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p><p>Angiogenesis impairment in diabetic peripheral vasculature contributes to delayed wound healing, increased risk of rejection of transplanted organs, exacerbated peripheral limb ischemia, and even cardiac mortality <xref rid="pone.0046720-Duh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. However, the mechanisms underlying diabetes-impaired angiogenesis are not completely understood. A growing body of evidence support that AGEs, as well as MGO, the major precursor of AGEs, and the receptor of AGEs (RAGE) are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complication <xref rid="pone.0046720-Yamagishi1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. MGO is believed to contribute to diabetic complications either as a direct toxin or as a precursor for advanced glycation end products. Consistent with this notion, the present study has implicated an important role of RAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>) and the MGO-detoxifying system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) for MGO-generated effects. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that AGE restriction may improve angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetic animal model <xref rid="pone.0046720-Peppa1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The relevance of AGEs-altered angiogenesis can also be seen in MGO-impaired gastric ulcer healing <xref rid="pone.0046720-Naito1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Recently, it has been found that O-GlcNAc modification mediated-Akt inhibition reduces angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0046720-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> and that the Akt-pathway also mediates the AGEs-effects on angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0046720-Devi1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. However, the dependency of Akt-pathway is lost pending serum presence, and it is yet to establish what serum factor contributes to the observations <xref rid="pone.0046720-Devi1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Nevertheless, these data imply that other factors essential in the angiogenic pathway are involved. For instance, the alterations of VEGFR1 have been shown to contribute to the impaired angiogenesis after hindlimb ischemia in a type 2 diabetic mouse model <xref rid="pone.0046720-Hazarika1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. In current study, we have not been able to detect as significant changes of the VEGFR1 as those of the VEGFR2 (data not shown).</p><p>Given the crucial role of VEGFR2 in endothelial angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0046720-Lakshmikanthan1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Sawamiphak1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Smadja1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, downregulation of endothelial VEGFR2 protein demonstrated in the present study could be a new mechanism. Surprisingly, quantitative data of VEGFR2 protein in aortic tissues are few in literature, in contrast to those reported either in cultural endothelial cells or in the circulation. One plausible reason could be that endothelial VEGFR2 expression in normal vascular tissue is low <xref rid="pone.0046720-Kuczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Indeed, only by immunoprecipitation enrichment could we detect VEGFR2 protein in control aortic tissues and its reduction in diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). In endothelia cells, VEGFR2 is found localized in endothelial caveolae, associated with caveolin-1, and this complex is rapidly dissociated upon stimulation with VEGF <xref rid="pone.0046720-Labrecque1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. A recent study showed that a significant amount of VEGFR2 exists in endosome <xref rid="pone.0046720-Gampel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and undergoes constitutive endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling <xref rid="pone.0046720-Jopling2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. The MGO-induced VEGFR2 reduction identified in the present study occurred predominantly in cytosol (and may be in plasma membrane as well). The observation implicates that MGO-mediated VEGFR2 degradation could be a detour from its normal trafficking. Such a deviation might represent an unidentified cellular mechanism by which diabetes reduces VEGR2 protein levels. Although the role of trafficking in MGO-mediated VEGFR2 reduction remains to be established, the alteration of VEGFR2 protein immune-fluorescent-staining in the presence of MGO and the involvement of both ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>/B/C) were confirmed with other approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g001">Fig. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>/B/C). Furthermore, aortic rings from diabetic (Akita and db/db) vs genetic control mice demonstrated lower angiogenic capacities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>/D), which were associated with VEGFR2 protein reductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). More importantly, the clinical relevance of VEGFR2 reduction in diabetes is apparent in that diabetes-associated VEGFR2 reductions have been observed both in humans <xref rid="pone.0046720-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Sasso1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and experimental animals <xref rid="pone.0046720-Jesmin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

The key evidence included the demonstration of MGO-enhanced autophagy initiation (increase in the number of LC3 punctae) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) and immune-coprecipitation of LC3B with VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Importantly, induction of autophagy either mimicked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) or enhanced the MGO-generated effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046720-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>/E/F). These data suggest that VEGFR2 is a potential target of autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway and essential for survival, differentiation, development, and homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0046720-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The pathway refers to a regulated catabolic cellular process for the lysosomal-dependent turnover of organelles and proteins <xref rid="pone.0046720-Ryter1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Autophagy principally plays an adaptive role to protect organisms against diverse pathologies, including infections, cancer, aging, heart disease, and neurodegeneration. However, in certain disease settings, self-eating or even the pro-survival functions of autophagy could be deleterious <xref rid="pone.0046720-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Although emerging evidence supports the role of autophagy in the pathophysiology of diabetes, especially in the maintenance of pancreatic function, it remains largely undecided whether autophagy plays a protective or harmful role in other organ-tissue systems <xref rid="pone.0046720-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>.

Indeed, mice deficient in the autophagic protein Beclin-1 display a pro-angiogenic phenotype associated with hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0046720-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Therefore, an autophagy-mediated reduction of VEGFR2 may contribute to diabetic angiogenesis impairment.

However, it merits further investigations on how autophagy is triggered to reduce VEGFR2. Due to the heterogeneity of angiogenic dysregulation in diabetes <xref rid="pone.0046720-Leeper1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the fact that angiogenesis is determined by a range of factors beyond vascular cell <xref rid="pone.0046720-RaskMadsen1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, it remains to be elucidated if VEGFR2-associated proteins or other angiogenic-related factors in vascular cell and beyond <xref rid="pone.0046720-Eichmann1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref> would be affected by similar mechanism under diabetic conditions.</p><p>Provided the important role of VEGFR2 in angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0046720-Lakshmikanthan1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Sawamiphak1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Smadja1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> and the association of AGEs/precursors (including MGO) with the pathogenesis of diabetic complications <xref rid="pone.0046720-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Yamagishi2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Mendez1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046720-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, we propose that impaired physiological angiogenesis in diabetes results, at least in part, from downregulation of VEGFR2.
