For example, application of glutamate to peripheral tissues produces acute nociception or mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia <xref rid="pone.0109723-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109723-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, experimental inflammation or electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve causes increase in glutamate release into peripheral tissues <xref rid="pone.0109723-Bereiter1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109723-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) is involved in the active loading of glutamate into synaptic vesicles before exocytotic release <xref rid="pone.0109723-Fremeau1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and plays a crucial role in glutamate signaling <xref rid="pone.0109723-Brumovsky1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Of the three isoforms of VGLUT, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are expressed by largely functionally-distinct populations of primary sensory neurons: i.e., VGLUT2 is expressed primarily by nociceptive neurons whereas VGLUT1 is expressed primarily by A&#x003b2; mechanoreceptive neurons <xref rid="pone.0109723-Brumovsky1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109723-Landry1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Recently, behavioral analysis of mice with a genetic deletion of VGLUT2 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons supported the notion that VGLUT2 plays a crucial role in acute and inflammatory pain <xref rid="pone.0109723-Lagerstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109723-Leo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The dental pulp is richly innervated by nociceptive A&#x003b4; and C fibers <xref rid="pone.0109723-Hildebrand1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Paik1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and is thus, frequently used as a model system to study peripheral pain mechanism. Recent studies reported that the dental pulp is also innervated by a few A&#x003b2; low threshold mechanoreceptive (LTM) fibers, which may be involved in the nociception rather than in mechanosensation <xref rid="pone.0109723-Fried1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Djouhri1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recently, we reported expression of VGLUT1 as well as VGLUT2 in the axons of the normal human dental pulp and that the VGLUT1 is expressed in larger number of pulpal axons than axons expressing VGLUT2, suggesting larger role of VGLUT1 than VGLUT2 in the transduction of acute nociception in the dental pulp <xref rid="pone.0109723-Paik2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Previous many studies have focused on the central signaling mechanism for pulpal inflammatory pain, which is dependent on glutamate. For example, application of the inflammatory irritant mustard oil to the dental pulp induces central sensitization in medullary dorsal horn, mediated by glutamate <xref rid="pone.0109723-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Chiang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, the peripheral signaling mechanism for pulpal inflammatory pain, and involvement of specific type of VGLUT in it, is largely unknown.</p><p>To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the rat dental pulp and trigeminal ganglion (TG) in a model of dental pulp inflammation, induced by complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant (CFA), using light microscopic immunohistochemistry, quantitative analysis of VGLUT1&#x02212; and VGLUT2&#x02212; immunopositive axons and somata, and Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All animal procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Kyungpook National University Intramural Animal Care and Use Committee (permit number: KNU 2011-44). Experiments were designed to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300&#x02013;320 g were used for this study, including 6 for light microscopic immunohistochemistry and 10 for Western blot analysis.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Tooth pulp inflammation model</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and the occlusal enamel and dentin of the right maxillary 1<sup>st</sup> (M1) and 2<sup>nd</sup> (M2) molars were filed off to just before exposing the pulp using a low-speed dental drill with a round bur under water-cooling. A small piece of tissue paper soaked in 50% CFA solution in saline was applied to the exposed dentinal surfaces for 5 minutes. Then, the dentinal surfaces were sealed with dental cement.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Light microscopic immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunofluorescence, on day 1 (CFA 1-day) or day 3 (CFA 3-day) following CFA application, rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, i.p.), transcardially perfused with heparinized normal saline, followed by freshly-prepared fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). The dental pulps and TGs on the right side (experimental group) and those of the left side (control group) were carefully removed, postfixed in the same fixative for 2 hours, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PB overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The next day, 30-&#x000b5;m thick sections were cut on a freezing microtome and treated with 50% ethanol for 30 minutes and with 10% normal donkey serum (NDS, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Groove, PA) for 30 minutes. The sections were incubated overnight in VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 antibodies in combination with protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antibody, a marker for neuron, or with CD64 antibody, a marker for inflammatory cells <xref rid="pone.0109723-Prigent1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> to confirm induction of inflammation. The primary antibodies used are as follows: guinea pig anti-VGLUT1 (#135304, 1&#x02236;2,000, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), rabbit anti-VGLUT2 (#135402, 1&#x02236;2,000, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), guinea pig anti-VGLUT2 (#VGLUT2-GP-Af670, 1&#x02236;1,000, Frontier Institute Co.

On the next day, the sections were washed with PB and incubated for 3 hours with a Cy3-conjugated-donkey anti-guinea pig or anti-rabbit antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated-donkey anti-mouse or anti-goat antibody (1&#x02236;200, in PB, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were then mounted on slides and coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and micrographs were obtained with an Exi digital camera (Q-Imaging Inc., Surrey, CA), attached to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany). To control for the specificity of the antibodies, sections were processed as described above, except that primary or secondary antibodies were omitted: Omission of primary or secondary antibodies eliminated specific staining. Preadsorption controls with blocking peptides for VGLUT1 (15 &#x000b5;g/ml; #135-3P, Synaptic Systems) and VGLUT2 (10 &#x000b5;g/ml; #G07B-VGLUT2-AG, Frontier Science) also completely abolished the respective staining.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Quantitative analysis of immunolabeled sections</title><p>To quantify the density of the VGLUT1+ and VGLUT2+ axons and somata in the dental pulp and TG, respectively, a total of 24&#x02013;30 images from 4&#x02013;5 tissue sections of each of 3 dental pulps in each of CFA 1-day and CFA 3-day rats and a total of 48 images from 4 tissue sections of each side of 3 TGs in each side of CFA 1-day and CFA 3-day rats were collected; quantitative analysis of VGLUT2+ axons was obtained from sections immunostained with rabbit anti-VGLUT2 antibody (Synaptic Systems).

It suggests that VGLUT2&#x02212; mediated glutamate signaling by pulpal axons is enhanced following pulpal inflammation, which may contribute to the sensitization of pulpal axons during inflammation and thus to inflammatory pain.</p><p>Electrophysiological studies have shown that application of mustard oil to the dental pulp induces an increase in glutamate release and sensitization of nociceptive neurons in the medullary dorsal horn <xref rid="pone.0109723-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Narita1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition, mice in which VGLUT2 is ablated selectively from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, show decreased responses to acute noxious stimuli, and attenuated mechanical or thermal responses in a model of neuropathic and inflammatory pain, suggesting that VGLUT2&#x02212; dependant glutamate signaling plays a crucial role in acute, neuropathic, and inflammatory pain <xref rid="pone.0109723-Lagerstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109723-Scherrer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These studies also indicate that the VGLUT2&#x02212; mediated glutamate signaling by the central endings of nociceptive afferents may be enhanced following inflammation, thus contributing to central sensitization and inflammatory hyperalgesia. The increase in the VGLUT2, but not VGLUT1, expression in the pulpal axons and TG somata following pulpal inflammation in our study provides a morphological evidence supporting the notion that the peripheral glutamate signaling by the pulpal axons may be also enhanced following pulpal inflammation, and that it may be mediated by VGLUT2: It was shown that expression level of VGLUT is closely related with the amount of glutamate release <xref rid="pone.0109723-Wojcik1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Daniels1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It corroborates previous studies showing increased glutamate release in peripheral tissues following inflammation <xref rid="pone.0109723-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Omote1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Lawand1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, but is at variance with a recent study showing that the number of neurons that express mRNA for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the mouse DRG does not change following CFA-induced inflammation <xref rid="pone.0109723-Malet1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Possible explanations of this discrepancy include differences in the detection methods (immunohistochemistry vs. in situ hybridization), species (rat vs. mouse), and peripheral tissues to which CFA was applied (dental pulp vs. plantar skin) between the present and previous studies. The upregulation of the VGLUT in this study may have been also, in part, due to the pulp injury by the reduction of the dentin. Glutamate released from the pulpal nociceptive axons may act on the releasing axon itself (autocrine) or on nearby axons (paracrine) to sensitize these axons. It can also evoke the release of neuropeptides and vasoactive substances from axons <xref rid="pone.0109723-Jackson2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Beirith1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which may contribute to the development of neurogenic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0109723-Louis1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Holzer1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Recent studies showed that orofacial tissue inflammation induces excitability increase of TG neurons innervating the inflamed tissue as well as those innervating non-inflamed tissue, and that this is caused by neuronal interaction among TG neurons: Thus, TRPV1 expression is increased in the TG neurons innervating inflamed as well as non-inflamed tissues, which is caused by stimulation of the adjacent TG neurons by molecules released from the TG neurons innervating inflamed tissue <xref rid="pone.0109723-Shinoda1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109723-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In the present study, dramatic increase in VGLUT2+ neurons and VGLUT2 protein in the TG was observed though inflammation was induced in maxillary 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> molar pulps, which are innervated by only a limited number of TG neurons. Considering the above mentioned reports, this might be also caused by neuronal interaction by various molecules released from the TG neurons innervating the inflamed pulps. Analysis of the VGLUT2 expression, in the present study, was performed only in the maxillary area of the TG innervating inflamed pulps. Given the cross-excitation of TG neurons following inflammation, VGLUT2 expression can be increased also in the mandibular area of the TG following inflammation of the maxillary molar pulps.</p><p>Dental pulp is primarily innervated by A&#x003b4; and C fibers, but also by many A&#x003b2; fibers <xref rid="pone.0109723-Paik1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Existence of pulpal A&#x003b2; fibers is also supported by many studies showing that many neurons innervating dental pulp are large- and medium-sized <xref rid="pone.0109723-Sugimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Fried2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and are not depleted by neonatal capsaicin treatment <xref rid="pone.0109723-Fried3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In addition, many studies reported that VGLUT1 is primarily expressed in the LTM A&#x003b2; fibers whereas VGLUT2 is primarily in small-diameter nociceptive fibers <xref rid="pone.0109723-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109723-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These reports suggest that VGLUT1 may be expressed in LTM A&#x003b2; fibers and VGLUT2 in nociceptive A&#x003b4; and C fibers in the dental pulp. Many studies suggested that pulpal LTM A&#x003b2; fibers may be involved in the nociception: Thus, all kinds of stimulations on the dental pulp result in the subjective experience of pain <xref rid="pone.0109723-Hildebrand1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Byers1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In addition, many of the large neurons innervating dental pulp, which may have A&#x003b2; fibers, terminate in the superficial lamina of the medullary dorsal horn <xref rid="pone.0109723-Marfurt1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and express peptides and neurotrophic factors which are normally associated with C fiber nociceptors <xref rid="pone.0109723-Fried3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Fehrenbacher1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In the present study, VGLUT1 was expressed in many pulpal axons, which is consistent with the previous study in the human dental pulp <xref rid="pone.0109723-Paik2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition, the density of VGLUT1+ axons and soma in the dental pulp and TG, respectively, in contrast to that of VGLUT2+ axons and soma, was not significantly different between control and CFA-treated group. Given that VGLUT1 may be expressed in many pulpal LTM A&#x003b2; fibers that may be involved in nociception, it is possible to assume that VGLUT1 in the pulpal axons can be involved in the glutamate signaling related to acute pulpal pain, while VGLUT2 in pulpal axons are primarily involved in the inflammatory pain.</p><p>Recent studies showed that VGLUTs are also expressed in non-neuronal cells, suggesting the possibility of glutamate release from non-neuronal cells, including pinealocytes in the pineal gland <xref rid="pone.0109723-Morimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, &#x003b1; cells in the Langerhans islets <xref rid="pone.0109723-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, and osteoclasts in bone <xref rid="pone.0109723-Morimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Glutamate release is also increased in peripheral tissues during inflammation <xref rid="pone.0109723-Omote1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Jean1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> from nociceptive afferents, but also from non-neuronal cells, like Schwann cells <xref rid="pone.0109723-Parpura1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0109723-Curi1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and macrophages <xref rid="pone.0109723-Klegeris1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. VGLUT has also been shown to increase in fibroblasts and infiltrating leukocytes in inflamed tendon and muscle <xref rid="pone.0109723-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109723-Spang1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This is in agreement with our observation of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 expression in CD64+ inflammatory cells following inflammation. In the present study, the protein level of VGLUT1 increased in the dental pulp, though the density of VGLUT1+ axons was not changed, in the CFA-treated group than control group. This might be caused by VGLUT1 expression in the CD64+ inflammatory cells in the dental pulp following inflammation. Activation of glutamate signaling by non-neuronal cells in the inflamed pulp can play a further role in sensitization of pulpal axons and development of inflammatory hyperalgesia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors sincerely thank Dr. Juli Valtschanoff for helpful discussion and careful reading of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0109723-Du1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
