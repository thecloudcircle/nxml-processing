B lymphocytes also express GITR, but a role of GITR in humoral immunity has not been fully explored. To address this question, we performed studies to determine the kinetics of GITR expression on na&#x000ef;ve and stimulated B cells and the capacity of B cells to develop and mount antibody responses in GITR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Results of our studies indicate that all mature B cells express GITR on the cell surface, albeit at different levels. Expression of GITR on na&#x000ef;ve mature B cells is upregulated by BCR signaling, but is counteracted by helper T cell-related factors and other inflammatory signals <italic>in vitro</italic>. In line with these findings, expression of GITR on germinal center and memory B cells is lower than that on na&#x000ef;ve B cells. However, the expression of GITR is strongly upregulated in plasma cells. Despite these differences in GITR expression, the absence of GITR has no effect on T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antibody responses to model antigens in GITR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, or on B cell activation and proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. GITR deficiency manifests only with a slight reduction of mature B cell numbers and increased turnover of na&#x000ef;ve B cells, suggesting that GITR slightly contributes to mature B cell homeostasis. Overall, our data indicate that GITR does not play a significant role in B cell development and antibody responses to T-dependent and independent model antigens within the context of a GITR-deficient genetic background.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Through the interplay of receptors and ligands, tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) members play a role in numerous biological processes. By affecting cell signaling, survival, proliferation and/or differentiation, TNFSF members regulate the immune system resulting in either beneficial or harmful effects <xref rid="pone.0031632-Aggarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One such protein is TNFRSF18 or glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family-related gene (GITR), which shares many characteristics with some other TNFRSF members, namely OX40, 4-1BB and CD27 <xref rid="pone.0031632-Nocentini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Like those TNFSF receptors, GITR only interacts with one ligand, GITRL <xref rid="pone.0031632-Bossen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, which is prevalently expressed by professional antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells <xref rid="pone.0031632-Tone1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Stephens1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The function of GITR has been studied mainly in T cells, which express GITR constitutively. Regulatory T cells express the highest level of GITR. However, antigen receptor stimulation of na&#x000ef;ve conventional T cells leads to GITR upregulation to levels observed in regulatory T cells <xref rid="pone.0031632-McHugh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Ronchetti1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Studies in T cells suggest that GITR plays an important role in modulating T cell responses. Deletion of GITR, or use of reagents that block GITRL, prevent optimal proliferation of T cells in response to CD3 stimulation with or without CD28 co-stimulation <xref rid="pone.0031632-Stephens1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Ronchetti1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, suggesting that GITR may function to improve the magnitude of T cell responses. In fact, GITR is required for the survival of antigen-specific CD8 T cell clones and their expansion in response to influenza infection <xref rid="pone.0031632-Snell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, stimulation of effector T cells through GITR provides them with resistance to suppression by regulatory T cells <xref rid="pone.0031632-Stephens1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, while GITR stimulation of regulatory T cells inhibits their suppressive function <xref rid="pone.0031632-McHugh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, GITR operates in different ways to promote T cell responses.

In this study, we investigated the regulation of GITR expression on B cells and its potential function in B cell development and B cell response.</p><p>Our studies demonstrate that B cells express GITR starting at the transitional stage of B cell development. GITR expression is positively modulated by BCR signaling and negatively regulated by factors commonly provided by helper T cells.

To determine when GITR is first expressed on developing B cells and its level on different B cell subsets, bone marrow and spleen B cells of wild-type mice were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of GITR and B cell developmental markers. In the bone marrow, some B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgD<sup>&#x02212;</sup> immature B cells displayed GITR slightly above antibody isotype control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), while pro-B cells and pre-B cells had no detectable GITR expression (data not shown). GITR was expressed on all bone marrow IgM<sup>high</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup> and spleen B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD24<sup>high</sup> transitional B cells, although these cell populations displayed large variation in expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Despite the detection of GITR on na&#x000ef;ve B cells, this level was considerably lower than that on na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which were used as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). GITR expression was also evaluated on antigen activated B cells (i.e., germinal center and memory B cells and plasma cells) that arise in response to environmental antigens in mice maintained in specific-pathogen free conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

For these studies, B cells were evaluated after 24 hours of culture because the transcription/translation inhibitors caused extensive cell death at a later time. A drawback of the short time cultures, however, was that GITR was not upregulated to the maximum level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, we found that DMSO, used as a diluent for the inhibitors and added to control cultures, inhibited somewhat GITR expression on B cells. Nevertheless, results of these studies show that addition of either actinomycin D or cycloheximide during BCR stimulation of B cells for 24 hours prevented the upregulation of GITR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Due to the variability in GITR expression on BCR-stimulated B cells, this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07), but inhibition of GITR upregulation was reproducibly observed in all experiments (<italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3</italic>).

<xref rid="pone.0031632-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> has reported that GITR expression is modulated by the NFAT signaling pathway in T cells. To determine whether NFAT regulates GITR expression on B cells, BCR-stimulated spleen B cells were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), an NFAT pathway inhibitor. Treatment of B cells with CsA prevented maximum upregulation of GITR on BCR-stimulated B cells and this difference was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). CD86 levels, in contrast, were not affected by CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating intact cell function. Our data, therefore, suggest that NFAT signaling promotes GITR upregulation on BCR-stimulated B cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Helper T cell factors inhibit GITR upregulation induced by BCR signaling on B cells</title><p>The upregulation of GITR expression mediated by BCR signaling on na&#x000ef;ve B cells contrasted the observation that germinal center and memory B cells, which are antigen-activated cells, expressed GITR at levels lower than those of na&#x000ef;ve B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Given these contrasting findings, we next explored how GITR levels are modulated by T cell factors, with the hypothesis that helper T cell-specific factors might decrease GITR expression. To this end, we utilized anti-CD40 antibodies and/or recombinant cytokines that recapitulate signals normally provided by T cells and other cells during Th1 and Th2 responses. Hence, 15 &#x000b5;g/ml of anti-CD40 antibodies, 50 ng/ml of IL-4, 100 or 1000 U/ml of IFN&#x003b3; or 1000 U/ml of IFN&#x003b1; were added to B cell cultures, with or without BCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and data not shown). This level of CD40 stimulation on B cells increased GITR expression albeit to a lower level than that induced by BCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, left panel). The induction of GITR expression by CD40 was not mediated <italic>via</italic> the NFAT pathway, as the addition of CsA to anti-CD40-treated B cells did not prevent GITR upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, right panel). In contrast to the positive effect of anti-CD40 on GITR expression, IL-4, IFN&#x003b3;, or IFN&#x003b1; alone did not alter GITR levels on B cells after 48 hours of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, when anti-CD40 antibodies, IL-4, IFN&#x003b3;, or IFN&#x003b1; were added to B cells in combination with BCR (anti-IgM) stimulation, these signals inhibited maximum GITR upregulation compared to BCR stimulation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that some helper T cell components, at least at the doses used here, block maximum GITR upregulation observed in response to a BCR signal on B cells.

This result, therefore, was in line with the reduced follicular B cell population observed in intact GITR-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) and the increased BrdU incorporation in B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031632-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data indicate that the absence of GITR does not hinder early B cell development, but it causes a small defect in the size of the follicular na&#x000ef;ve B cell compartment. This defect does not affect further differentiation of B cells into antigen-selected B cell subsets, such as memory B cells and plasma cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was performed to determine whether the TNF family receptor GITR plays a role in basic B cell functions. We found that expression of GITR on mature B cells is upregulated by BCR signaling and downregulated by factors commonly provided by helper T cells. In spite of this, the absence of GITR had only minimal effects on mature B cell numbers, while it did not affect antibody responses to model antigens, or B cell activation and proliferation. These findings indicate that GITR does not play a significant role in B cell development and antibody responses in GITR-deficient mice.</p><p>We show that GITR is expressed at low levels on the surface of resting mature B cells, approximately 10-fold lower than those on na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T cells. BCR stimulation, however, increases GITR expression on mature B cells by at least 10-fold within 24 hours. Thus, on BCR-stimulated B cells, GITR reaches levels comparable to those of na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T cells. Like BCR stimulation on B cells, TCR stimulation on T cells also leads to upregulation of GITR by approximately 10-fold <xref rid="pone.0031632-McHugh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Ronchetti1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, it appears that a common signaling pathway downstream of antigen receptors in both B and T cells leads to upregulation of GITR. Based on our experiments involving transcription and translation inhibitors, we conclude that the increase in GITR surface levels on BCR-stimulated B cells results from <italic>de novo</italic> gene transcription, which is perhaps the reason why maximum surface GITR levels are achieved by 24&#x02013;72 hours, and not by 8 hours following antigen receptor stimulation.</p><p>In T cells, GITR upregulation was shown to be inhibited by NFAT signaling <xref rid="pone.0031632-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In contrast, we found that in B cells, inhibition of the NFAT pathway by CsA prevented maximum GITR upregulation following BCR stimulation. This suggests that NFAT promotes, and does not inhibit, GITR expression in B cells. We explain this difference by the fact that Zhan <italic>et al.</italic> determined the effect of NFAT on GITR expression on T cells stimulated with ionomycin, and not <italic>via</italic> the TCR <xref rid="pone.0031632-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In fact, when we analyzed GITR expression on CD3-stimulated T cells in the presence of CsA, we found that GITR upregulation required NFAT signaling (data not shown). In contrast, upregulation of GITR on T cells stimulated with ionomycin was increased by CsA as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0031632-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, but only when a low ionomycin concentration (200 ng/ml) was used (data not shown). NFAT inhibition was unable to completely suppress GITR expression on BCR-stimulated B cells, suggesting that additional molecular pathways control <italic>Tnfrsf18</italic> gene transcription. Candidate pathways may be those signaling <italic>via</italic> NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK, which have been additionally suggested to promote GITR expression in T cells <xref rid="pone.0031632-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the fact that BCR signaling promotes GITR upregulation on B cells, neither GITR stimulation nor GITR-deficiency modulated expression of activation markers and proliferation of B cells stimulated with anti-IgM antibodies and additional stimuli. These findings suggest that GITR does not function as a costimulatory molecule for BCR signaling. GITR-deficient B cells in intact GITR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and in mixed bone marrow chimeras displayed only a minor but consistent defect at the na&#x000ef;ve mature cell stage. Namely, we observed slight, but significant, reduced numbers of GITR-deficient mature B cells. Furthermore, we observed a higher frequency of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> resting B cells in the spleen of GITR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice relative to control mice fed BrdU for one or two weeks. A higher frequency of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells entering the peripheral mature B cell population within this timeframe suggests a reduced lifespan and an increased cell turnover. These findings support the idea that GITR slightly contributes to the survival of na&#x000ef;ve mature B cells and to their homeostasis. A similar role of GITR on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell homeostasis and the survival of antigen activated CD8 T cells have been previously reported <xref rid="pone.0031632-Stephens1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Snell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>GITR deficiency did not translate into defects in antibody responses to T-dependent and T-independent model antigens and entry of B cells into the antigen-activated cell populations. If GITR were important for the survival of antigen activated B cells, we expected to find a reduced BrdU incorporation in the B cell memory and plasma cell populations, a result we did not observe. A potential explanation for the lack of effects of GITR deficiency on B cell responses might be that GITR is not upregulated (or perhaps is downregulated) on activated B cells <italic>in vivo</italic> in the presence of various inflammatory stimuli. In fact, GITR was minimally expressed on antigen-activated B cells that had been exposed to helper T cell factors and inflammatory cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic>, and it was also poorly expressed on germinal center and memory B cells <italic>ex-vivo</italic>. Thus, activated B cells in the context of an intact immune system may be undistinguishable from GITR-deficient B cells in relation to GITR expression and, therefore, response. It has been reported that GITR stimulation greatly improves humoral responses to ovalbumin and hemagglutinin <italic>in vivo</italic>, potentially by increasing Th1 and Th2 cytokine production by T cells <xref rid="pone.0031632-Ponte1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Based on this latter study, we anticipated finding a reduced antibody response to NP-CGG in GITR-deficient mice, a result we did not observe. These apparently discordant results may indicate that the role of GITR in immune responses depends on the type of antigen and adjuvant. Alternatively, the effect of GITR deficiency on B cells might be masked by its absence on other cell types in GITR-deficient mice (as observed for CD8 T cells, <xref rid="pone.0031632-Snell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>) or might manifest only in certain genetic backgrounds. Such issues could be addressed by analyzing bone marrow chimeras in which only B cells lack GITR and by backcrossing GITR-deficient mice into other genetic backgrounds, respectively.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the minimal effects of GITR deficiency on B cells is that the function of GITR is shared by other TNF-family receptors <xref rid="pone.0031632-Nocentini2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although our studies cannot exclude the possibility that other TNF-family receptors share a redundant function with GITR in B cells, we think that this is probably not the case. The reason is that when we evaluated two of the TNF-family receptors that are the most similar to GITR, CD27 and OX40, we found that they were not significantly expressed on resting B cells (data not shown). More importantly, expression of CD27 and OX40 was not significantly upregulated on either GITR-sufficient or GITR-deficient B cells upon BCR stimulation (data not shown), suggesting that CD27 and OX40 do not share a redundant function with GITR in B cells.</p><p>What other role, if any, may GITR play in B cells? The fact that expression of GITR on B cells is positively regulated by BCR stimulation and negatively regulated by factors provided by helper T cells suggests that GITR may function to discriminate the response of B cells that receive signal 1 (antigen) in the absence of signal 2 (e.g., T cell help, inflammatory cytokines) from that of B cells that receive both signals. For instance, GITR may be important in the context of B cell tolerance to self-antigens. Presently, this seems unlikely given that we were unable to detect anti-chromatin antibodies (the most common autoantibodies expressed when B cell tolerance is defective) in young and old GITR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (data not shown). Alternatively, GITR might play a role in B cell responses that we have not tested such as cytokine production during immune responses, and generation of neutralizing antibodies during infections. Although not having a significant role in common B cell functions, GITR may still function as a marker to distinguish B cell subsets given that its expression decreases in GC and memory B cells while it increases in plasma cells relative to na&#x000ef;ve B cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that, in the context of a whole GITR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> genetic background, GITR does not play a significant role in B cell generation or antibody responses to model antigens, but it slightly contributes to mature B cell homeostasis. Our data, therefore, support the idea that defects in immune responses observed in mice that lack GITR are not likely caused by changes in B cell function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>CB17, BALB/c, 129S1/svImJ (129S1), and B6.SJL mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and then bred or maintained in our facility.
