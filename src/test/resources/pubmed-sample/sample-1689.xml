Therefore, it&#x02019;s very important to study the molecular mechanism of this resistance. In our previous study we found that integrin beta1 can induce EGFR TKIs resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here we analyzed the association of integrin beta1 and c-MET that is a recognized mechanism of EGFR TKIs resistance in NSCLC to demonstrate the mechanism of integrin beta1 related EGFR TKIs resistance. We found that the ligands of integrin beta1 and c-MET could synergistically promote cell proliferation and their inhibitors could synergistically improve the sensitivity to gfitinib, increase apoptosis, and inhibit the downstream signal transduction: focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and AKT. On the other hand, ligand-dependent activation of integrin beta1 could induce EGFR TKIs resistance through activating c-MET and its downstream signals. Thus, it can be concluded that there is crosstalk between integrin beta1 and c-MET and integrin beta1 mediates EGFR TKI resistance associating with c-MET signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Non-small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Integrin beta1</kwd><kwd>c-MET</kwd><kwd>EGFR TKI</kwd><kwd>Resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The EGFR inhibitor gefitinib has been used as a single agent in NSCLC, but overall, the resistance remains a major problem clinicians encountered. Our previous result has shown that integrin beta1 overexpression associates with EGFR TKI resistance in PC9/AB2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In this study we further investigated the mechanism of integrin beta1-related EGFR TKI resistance.</p><p>Integrins and are formed by &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; integrin subunits. There are at least 24 known heterodimers formed by 18 &#x003b1; and eight &#x003b2; subunits. Natural integrin ligands include important components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Beta1 subunit of integrin is an adhesion molecule involved in cell survival and cancer resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], sharing common downstream signaling elements with EGFR, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The c-MET receptor is a 190-kD disulfide linked &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. and expressed in 60%&#x02013;80% of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Unlike EGFR, the only known natural ligand for c-MET is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also known as scatter factor). Activation of c-MET can lead to proliferation, increased survival, altered motility, enhanced invasion into extracellular matrix, and more rapid formation of tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On activation by autophosphorylation, c-MET can activate its multiple downstream signal transduction intermediates. Novel small molecule inhibitors of c-MET, SU11274 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and PHA-665752 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of c-MET and the proliferation of cells in vitro.</p><p>In recent years, c-MET also has been found to be an independent biomarker of EGFR TKI resistance and about 21% acquired EGFR TKI resistance is caused by overexpression of c-MET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Another research found that through promoting MET-integrin association, HGF-FN and HGF-VN complexes coordinated and enhanced endothelial cell migration through activation of the PI-3 kinase pathway involving a Ras-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. There is also an important crosstalk between c-MET and the integrin beta1 in mast cell: stimulation through c-MET and the &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 integrin resulted in crosstalk between the two receptors, resulting in the activation of the mast cell leading to release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the crosstalk between integrin beta1 and c-MET may be also related with EGFR TKI resistance.</p><p>In present study, we investigated the relationship between integrin beta1 and c-MET in EGFR TKI resistance to explore the mechanism of EGFR TKI resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>All experiments were performed with the approved of the Tongji University Institutional Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p></sec><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Human phospho-ERK antibody and human phospho-FAK antibody were purchased from Animal BioWorld Technology (Dublin, OH); human c-MET antibody, human phospho-AKT antibody, human phospho-c-MET antibody and human phospho-EGFR antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); &#x003b2;-actin antibody was purchased from ABGENT (San Diego, CA); human integrin beta1/CD29 antibody was purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); IRDyeTM 800 Conjugated Affinity Purified Anti-mouse/rabbit Antibody was purchased from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>Human NSCLC cell line PC9 (harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion) was provided by Cancer Institute of Medical School, Tongji University, China [the original PC-9 cells were purchased from Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Takasaki, Gunma, Japan).

Maybe because the level of integrin beta1 in PC9/AB2 cells is higher than that in PC9 cells, the synergistic effect of HGF and FN in PC9/AB2 cells is more evident than in PC9 cells. These results could be due to potential crosstalk between integrin beta1 and c-MET signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Combination of integrin beta1-target siRNA and c-MET kinase inhibitor SU11274 synergized to inhibit proliferation of PC9/AB2 NSCLC cell line</title><p>Since the synergistic proliferative effect of HGF and FN has been observed, we want to know whether the synergistic inhibition to cell growth can be found when we combined integrin beta1 siRNA with c-MET kinase inhibitor SU11274. The IC50 for each treatment was determined by MTT assay. The results shown that the IC50 for gefitinib alone and the combination of SU11274 and gefitinib were (24.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.45) &#x003bc;mol/L and (7.34&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.84) &#x003bc;mol/L in PC9/AB2 cells, respectively. Interestingly, a synergistic effect of gefitinib on inhibition of cell proliferation was seen in the presence of same dose of SU11274 in integrin beta1-inhibited AB2/17-2 cells. The IC50 for gefitinib alone in AB2/17-2 cells was (1.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.28) &#x003bc;mol/L, however the IC50 was (0.26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.15) &#x003bc;mol/L in the presence of same dose of SU11274 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). So, to inhibit the cells growth by 50%, we need 30% or 8% of original gefitinib concentration respectively in presence of SU11274 or integrin beta1-siRNA only. But we need only 1% of original gefitinib concentration when SU11274 and integrin beta1-target siRNA were combined. It suggested that combined inhibition of integrin beta1 and c-MET could improve effect of gefitinib in PC9/AB2 NSCLC cell line synergistically.</p></sec><sec><title>Combination of integrin beta1-target siRNA and c-MET kinase inhibitor SU11274 induced apoptosis in a synergistic fashion</title><p>TUNEL assay was performed to examine apoptosis.

We provide evidence that integrin beta1/MET crosstalk is a key factor of EGFR TKIs resistance, thus rendering integrin beta1/c-MET a suitable double-target for adjuvant therapy in combination with anti-EGFR agents currently used in clinic.</p><p>Although the patients with mutant EGFR display dramatic response to EGFR TKIs, duration of response is typically only 9 to 10 months and then most patients eventually acquire resistance to the agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], leading to treatment failure. Mechanisms for acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs have been widely studied. T790M mutation and c-MET gene amplification have been found to be related to acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Except for the above two mechanisms, others that account for the remaining about 30% of acquired resistance are still unclear. Some papers showed that integrin beta1 signaling has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers, and shown to facilitate resistance to radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Moreover, our previous research had confirmed that integrin beta1 was responsible for EGFR TKI resistance.</p><p>Integrin beta1, that associates with the adhesion and migration capability of tumor cells and has a key role in the growth and metastasis of tumors, is an important molecular of the adhesion-mediated drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The FN receptor (&#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin) binds to fibronectin to anchor cells and activates non receptor tyrosine kinases, FAK and Src, which play an important role in tumorigenesis by promoting the proliferation and invasion of cancer and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In our previous research, we have established the cell lines with stable down- and up- expression of integrin beta1 by transfecting siRNA or integrin beta1 cDNA plasmid into PC9/AB2 cells or PC9 cells, respectively. After down-regulation of integrin beta1, PC9/AB2 cells partially restored sensitivity to gefitinib while up-regulation of integrin beta1 led to resistance of PC9 cells to gefitinib. Expression level of integrin beta1 was negatively correlated with gefitinib sensitivity in these two cell lines. These data identified that integrin beta1 is an important factor of EGFR TKIs resistance. Morello also found that the integrin beta1-silenced cells showed a defective activation of the EGFR signaling cascade, leading to decreased in vitro proliferation, enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib, impaired migration and invasive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed that both integrin beta1 and c-MET were expressed in these cell lines, and their ligands can enhance cell proliferation synergistically. Importantly, inhibition of both receptors led to growth inhibition and apoptosis, and down-regulation of phosphorylation of molecules in their downstream signal transduction (such as the AKT, FAK pathways) in a synergistic fashion. Ligand-dependent activation of integrin beta1 induced c-MET and it&#x02019;s downstream signals activation (FAK, and AKT). Mitra et al. also reported that inhibition of &#x003b1;(5)&#x003b2;(1)-integrin decreased the phosphorylation of c-Met, FAK and Src, both in vitro and in vivo. Activation of c-Met by its ligand, HGF/SF, or overexpression of a constitutively active FAK in HeyA8 cells could overcome the effect of &#x003b1;(5)&#x003b2;(1)-integrin inhibition on tumor cell invasion, indicating that &#x003b1;(5)&#x003b2;(1)-integrin is upstream of c-Met, Src and FAK. Inhibition of &#x003b1;(5)&#x003b2;(1)-integrin on cancer cells in two xenograft models of ovarian cancer metastasis resulted in a significant decrease of tumor burden, which was independent of the effect of &#x003b1;(5)&#x003b2;(1)-integrin on angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These data shows that there is a crosstalk between integrin beta1 and c-MET signaling pathways, and it reaches consensus with Beviglia&#x02019;s results that the two signaling pathways, integrin/ECM and c-MET/HGF, cooperate synergistically to induce FAK activation in an adhesion-dependent manner, leading to enhanced cell adhesion and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we identified that the crosstalk between integrin beta1 and c-MET via AKT and FAK signaling pathways is very important in EGFR TKI resistance. Our findings identified a new molecular mechanism of EGFR TKIs resistance, which will provide an effective therapeutic intervention of EGFR TKIs resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None of the authors of this study has a conflict of interest statement.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ZC contributed to concept development and study design.
