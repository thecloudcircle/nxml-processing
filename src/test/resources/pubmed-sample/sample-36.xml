The description by Saphner et al. [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] of different patterns of recurrence for patients diagnosed from 1978 to 1988 has been a mainstay of clinical practice and research, particularly the discreet outcomes between estrogen-sensitive and estrogen insensitive tumors. However, since 1990s both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to breast cancer have changed radically, and accordingly the overall outcomes of breast cancer patients have been improved [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, breast cancer has been classified according to molecular factors that predict response to treatment. Cossetti et al. [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that the timing and patterns of recurrence differ according to breast cancer molecular subtypes and that these patterns persist with current therapies, albeit with better overall outcomes.</p><p>This analysis evaluated the recurrence patterns, e.g., time course, association between ITR and patient subgroup, and anatomical distribution, in a consecutive series of patients who presented with ILRRs after treatment with mastectomy and adjuvant systemic therapies in the contemporary era.</p><sec id="s3_1"><title>Time course</title><p>In this analysis, annual frequency of recurrences, rather than annual hazard of recurrence (HRR), was used to determine the time course, due to the fact that this is not a cohort study dealing with recurrence risk in patients with diagnosis of breast cancer. The peak of recurrence for the entire group was demonstrated to be within the second year after surgery, which is consistent with the results of Saphner et al. [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and others [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The pattern of a recurrence peak during the first 3 years was also noted to varying degrees in most subgroups based on nodal and HR status. However, node-positive patients showed an earlier peak of recurrence, i.e., approximately within the first year after mastectomy, and much less recurred beyond 5 years than did node-negative patients. This observation is consistent with those of Saphner et al. [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], who observed that the patients with the greater tumor burdens tend to have the steeper decreases in risk of recurrence. Similarly, when compared with HR-negative patients, a HR-positive status was associated with a greater proportion of recurrences occurring 5 years after surgery. In other words, HR-positive tumors recurred more frequently in late follow-up. This information may suggest that HR status embodies an entirely different natural history of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>The association of ITR and patient subgroup</title><p>We demonstrated a median ITR of 33 months for the entire group, which is roughly similar to previous reports. The analyses by nodal and HR status show that node-negative and HR-positive patients take a longer interval to develop recurrences. This observation provides further evidence supporting the above-mentioned findings that node-negative and HR-positive subgroups experienced more frequency of recurrences in late follow-up.</p><p>Further, our analysis demonstrated that an association existed between constructed biologic subtype and median ITR following mastectomy. The HER2 and TNBC patients, namely HR-negative subtypes known to be more aggressive, are shown to have shorter ITRs. This phenomenon might be attributed to the fact that the administration of adjuvant endocrine therapy delays disease recurrence in patients with node-negative, HR-positive breast cancer. Among all biologic subtypes, HER2 rather than TNBC patients are demonstrated to have the shortest ITRs. The reason for this outcome might be that in our study some of the HER2 patients were treated before the standard anti-HER2 treatment, and some could not afford the expenses and had to give up the use of adjuvant trastuzumab. Undoubtedly, the prognosis of HER2-positive patients has been improved with the use of trastuzumab [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The biology inferred by breast cancer subtypes therefore seems to be the major driver of disease recurrence. Whether the post-mastectomy follow-up frequency should be adjusted or not according to the specific recurrence pattern of different biologic subtypes is worthy to be discussed. For node-positive and HR-negative patients, a more frequent follow-up plan, especially during the first 5 years following mastectomy, might be warranted to facilitate early detection of recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="s3_3"><title>Anatomical distribution of ILRRs</title><p>Our analysis showed that a greater proportion (&#x02248;1/2) of recurrences were isolated to regional nodes. Chest wall and para-clavicular region were demonstrated to be involved in a similar proportion of the entire group. In addition, IM involvement was seen in 18% of patients. However, in review of previous series that report LRRs, around 60% are seen in chest wall only and 30% regional only (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When multiple recurrences are included, the chest wall may be involved in as many as 60&#x02013;80% of patients, and the para-clavicular region involved in around 20&#x02013;30% of patients in previous series (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Besides, the involvement of IMNs in previous studies is not as common as our findings for this group of patients. Possible reasons for these differences in anatomical distribution of recurrences between this and previous series might include the thickness of flap left at surgery, era of adjuvant systemic therapies, and use of radiological imaging, etc. However, such an observation doesn't seem to change current practice on PMRT. In other words, ipsilateral chest wall and para-clavicular region remain the principle clinical target volume (CTV) to be irradiated in high risk breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy. Since inconsistent results were reported regarding the overall survival benefit from IM irradiation following mastectomy [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], now is not the time to terminate the debate on IMN irradiation, though some major randomized trials evaluating the role of regional nodal irradiation did have included IMN as a part of CTV [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Obviously, a case-by-case consideration of the risk of IMN nodal involvement, as well as patient anatomy and ability to exclude critical normal structures from the treatment fields, is imperative.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Distribution of ILRRs after mastectomy by site</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. of patients</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chest wall only</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regional nodes only</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chest wall + regional nodes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nielsen et al.

The ILRR is defined as a recurrence within the ipsilateral chest wall and/or regional nodes (i.e., ipsilateral axilla, supra-/infra-clavicular region, or internal mammary chain), without concomitant visceral or bony distant metastasis (DM) within 4 months of LRR. All metastases were ruled out by thorough restaging evaluation, e.g., brain MR, chest CT, abdomen US or MR, and ECT, etc. Patients who received previous radiation to the chest wall and/or regional nodes, or had pathology other than breast cancer, or with unknown receptor status, were excluded from this study.</p><p>Data were extracted from prospectively collected institutional database to determine clinical, pathologic, treatment, and outcome variables. Health information management professionals trained in data abstraction reviewed the complete medical records of eligible patients. Information, including age at diagnosis, menopausal status, stage, grade, histology, and biomarkers (i.e., estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)) were extracted. Data on systemic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy, and hormonal therapy) and dates of diagnosis and disease recurrence were also obtained.</p><p>Patients were classified into subgroups based on the characteristics at time of initial diagnosis, e.g., nodal and HR status. Breast cancer biologic subtypes were constructed according to ER, PR, HER2 status, and tumor grade into 5 categories as follows: i) luminal A: ER+ or PR+, HER2-, and grade 1 or 2, ii) luminal B: ER+ or PR+, HER2-, and grade 3, iii) luminal HER2: ER+ or PR+, and HER2+, iv) HER2: ER- and PR- and HER2+, and v) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC): ER- and PR-, and HER2- [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Basically, luminal A, B and luminal HER2 subtypes constitute HR-positive subgroup, whereas HER2 and TNBC subtypes constitute HR-negative subgroup.</p><p>ER and PR status were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and were considered positive if IHC staining &#x02265; 10% of tumor tissue. HER2 status was determined by IHC staining. Tumors were considered HER2 positive if they scored 3+, on IHC, indeterminate if 2+, and negative if 1+ or 0. When IHC was indeterminate, tumors were considered HER2 positive with amplification (ratio &#x02265; 2.0) by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) analysis.</p><p>The ITR is defined as the length of time from the date of mastectomy until local and/or regional recurrence occurred. The annual frequency and anatomical distribution of recurrences was determined using descriptive statistics. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the frequencies between patient subgroups. K Independent-Samples Test was used to evaluate the association between ITR and patient subgroups, e.g., constructed biologic subtype. All statistical tests were two-sided, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING</title><p>We thank our patients for their generous contribution.
