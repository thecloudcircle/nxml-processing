The early host-pathogen interactions that occur during <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI and subsequent mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are poorly defined. Here, we define the early interactions between human bladder urothelial cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and mouse bladder using uropathogenic <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> (UPSA) 807 and ABU-causing <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> (ABSA) 834 strains. UPSA 807 adhered, invaded and killed bladder urothelial cells more efficiently compared to ABSA 834 via mechanisms including low-level caspase-3 activation, and cytolysis, according to lactate dehydrogenase release measures and cell viability. Severe UPSA 807-induced cytotoxicity was mediated entirely by the bacterial &#x003b2;-hemolysin/cytolysin (&#x003b2;-H/C) because an &#x003b2;-H/C-deficient UPSA 807 isogenic mutant, UPSA 807&#x00394;<italic>cylE</italic>, was not cytotoxic <italic>in vitro</italic>; the mutant was also significantly attenuated for colonization in the bladder <italic>in vivo</italic>. Analysis of infection-induced cytokines, including IL-8, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed that cytokine and chemokine responses were dependent on expression of &#x003b2;-H/C that also elicited severe bladder neutrophilia. Thus, virulence of UPSA 807 encompasses adhesion to, invasion of and killing of bladder cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses that elicit neutrophil infiltration, and &#x003b2;-H/C-mediated subversion of innate immune-mediated bacterial clearance from the bladder.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, also known as Group B streptococcus, is a common commensal of the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

A recent review of the overall burden of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI underscores the importance of these infections as a major public-health concern, with approximately 160,000 cases in the United States annually<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>The pathogenic mechanisms that underlie acute UTI due to <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> are poorly defined.

However, few studies have examined the role of virulence factors in <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI. <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> can bind to human bladder urothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and induce potent production of interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b1; in the murine bladder following <italic>in vivo</italic> colonization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> is able to colonize the bladder urothelium in a gentamicin-protected manner <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting that the bacteria invade host cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Kulkarni <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> also demonstrated that <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> colonizes bladder urothelial cells and that the &#x003b2; hemolysin/cytolysin (&#x003b2;-H/C) of the bacteria induces inflammation but is dispensable for bladder colonization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The processes of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> adhesion to urothelial cells and induction of host innate immune responses as early stages of pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> may also be influenced by bacterial growth in urine that can underpin some of the dynamics of microbial colonization of the urinary tract<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. For example, a recent study showed that some ABU-causing <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> (ABSA) strains can grow in urine, in contrast to some uropathogenic <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> (UPSA) that are unable to grow in urine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>The clinical relevance of acute UTI and ABU due to <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> highlights the need to better elucidate the early host-pathogen interactions underlying these different forms of infection. Here, we reveal distinct early colonization events encompassing urothelial cells, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), whole bladder tissue, innate cytokine responses, neutrophil infiltration and clinical strains of acute UTI- and ABU-causing <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> that provide new insight into the host-pathogen interactions underpinning these infections. Comparisons of <italic>in vitro</italic> colonization-adhesion and invasion, infection-induced cell death, and innate immune responses alongside <italic>in vivo</italic> infection assays in the mouse UTI model reveal differences in adhesion, invasion and cytotoxicity of UPSA and ABSA towards urothelial cells, MDMs and bladder tissue. We reveal acute bladder neutrophilia in mice following infection with UPSA but not ABSA and provide evidence that inflammation, cytotoxicity, and neutrophil infiltration is mediated by the bacterial &#x003b2;-H/C, which also promotes the survival of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> in the bladder.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>UPSA 807 adheres to and invades human bladder urothelial cells more efficiently compared to ABSA 834</title><p>We initially examined whether UPSA and ABSA might adhere to and invade urothelial cells with distinct efficiencies since these processes are critical early steps in UTI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays that were optimized to differentiate between adhered, intracellular and surviving <italic>S. agalactiae</italic>, showed that strain UPSA 807 adhered to and invaded human 5637 bladder urothelial cells at significantly higher levels compared to ABU strain ABSA 834 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Macrophages are also crucial innate defense cells in the bladder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and interestingly we also observed significantly more adhesion to and uptake by human U937 MDMs by UPSA 807 compared to ABSA 834 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The differences observed were most significant at the lowest MOI tested (50), equating to 52.7% and 30.9% more UPSA 807 than ABSA 834 recovered at 1&#x02009;h p.i. in urothelial cell and MDM adhesion assays, respectively. Invasion and bacterial uptake assays at 3&#x02009;h p.i. demonstrated 84.5% and 91.6% more intracellular UPSA 807 than ABSA 834 in urothelial cells and MDMs (at MOI 50), respectively. Thus, UPSA 807 is significantly more adherent and invasive in human urothelial cells and MDMs compared to ABSA 834. Subsequent analysis of another clinical ABU strain, ABSA 1014, performed to compare with ABSA 834, showed similar patterns in adhesion compared to UPSA 807 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>UPSA 807 kills urothelial cells more effectively than ABSA 834 via a mechanism that involves low-level caspase-3 activation and cytolysis mediated by the &#x003b2;-H/C</title><p>Infection-induced cell death can occur in urothelial cells during UTI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and we next analyzed whether human bladder urothelial cells and MDMs might be killed following infection with UPSA 807 or ABSA 834. We observed severe cytotoxicity in urothelial cells and MDMs following infection with UPSA 807, but not ABSA 834, over the first 24&#x02009;h p.i., according to cell viability measures and LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). To investigate the mechanism by which UPSA 807 induces cellular cytotoxicity in bladder cells, we assessed caspase-3 activiation in infected cells, which revealed a statistically significant but modest level of caspase-3 activation following infection with UPSA 807 <italic>in vitro;</italic> the equivalent response of significant caspase-3 activation did not occur following infection with ABSA 834 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Analysis of the activity of several caspases that lie upstream of caspase-3, using cell lysates from infected cultures at 5&#x02009;h p.i., demonstrated no significant caspase-1, -8 or -9 activity following UPSA 807 infection (data not shown).</p><p><italic>S. agalactiae</italic> cytotoxicity is often attributed to the bacterial &#x003b2;-H/C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and we measured the hemolytic activity of UPSA 807 and ABSA 834 using an erythrocyte lysis assay. UPSA 807 exhibited significantly higher hemolytic activity compared to ABSA 834 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). To determine the function of the bacterial &#x003b2;-H/C in terms of urothelial cell death we generated an isogenic &#x003b2;-H/C-deficient UPSA 807 mutant (UPSA 807&#x00394;<italic>cylE</italic>) and analyzed cytotoxicity. In contrast to wild-type (wt) UPSA 807, the 807&#x00394;<italic>cylE</italic> mutant was not hemolytic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and, notably, was significantly less cytotoxic to urothelial cells, according to cell viability counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and LDH release measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Interestingly, UPSA 807 also exhibited significantly more rapid cytotoxicity towards urothelial cell viability compared to ABSA 1014, according to total cell counts and LDH release measures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b,c</xref>) even though these two strains showed equivalent levels of hemolytic activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>UPSA 807 induces a more rapid and robust pro-inflammatory cytokine response in human urothelial cells and MDMs compared to ABSA 834 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Analysis of the pro-inflammatory effects of UPSA 807 and ABSA 834 towards bladder urothelial cells showed that UPSA 807 induced significantly more IL-8, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, but not TNF-&#x003b1;, compared to ABSA 834 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Time-course analysis (3&#x02009;h, 6&#x02009;h, and 24&#x02009;h p.i.) showed significant production of several cytokines at 6&#x02009;h p.i. in response to UPSA 807, in contrast to either insignificant responses or delayed production (24&#x02009;h p.i.) following infection with ABSA 834. Similarly, MDMs infected with UPSA 807 produced significantly higher levels of IL-8 and IL-1&#x003b2; as early as 6&#x02009;h p.i. and also produced higher levels of TNF-&#x003b1; compared to MDMs infected with ABSA 834 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).

Thus, UPSA 807 induces a stronger and more rapid pro-inflammatory response than ABSA 834 in two cell types relevant to the bladder.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>UPSA 807 colonizes the bladder more rapidly than ABSA 834 but fails to persist</title><p>In <italic>ex vivo</italic> adhesion assays, used to assess early adherence of bacteria to the bladder, significantly higher numbers of UPSA 807 were recovered from whole bladder at 0.5&#x02009;h p.i. compared to ABSA 834 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a)</xref> (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.043).

Similarly higher recovery of ABSA 1014 compared to UPSA 807 was also observed at 24&#x02009;h p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). There were no significant differences in bacterial loads in urine between any of the strains during the first 12&#x02009;h p.i.; however, ABSA 1014 was recovered in significantly higher numbers compared to both UPSA 807 and ABSA 834 at 24&#x02009;h p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), and while the average bacteriuria load was higher for ABSA 834 than UPSA 807 at 24&#x02009;h p.i., this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.052).

Several cytokines and chemokines were detected as earlier as 6&#x02009;h p.i. in response to UPSA 807, including KC, Rantes, G-CSF, MIP-1&#x003b1; and IL-6 at levels significantly higher than the PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). UPSA 807 induced KC, Rantes and IL-6 at significantly higher levels than ABSA 834 at 6&#x02009;h p.i. but we did not detect any significant IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-10 or TNF-&#x003b1; responses at 6&#x02009;h p.i.

Overall, cytokine production in the bladder was significantly lower in mice following infection with the &#x003b2;-H/C-deficient 807&#x00394;<italic>cylE</italic> mutant compared with wt UPSA 807; only KC and TNF-&#x003b1; were significantly elevated above control levels detected in the PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). The observation of a broad absence of cytokine and chemokine responses in the bladders in mice infected with 807&#x00394;<italic>cylE</italic> was consistent with a 5-fold lower neutrophil infiltrate in the bladder in mice infected with the 807&#x00394;<italic>cylE</italic> mutant compared to wt UPSA 807 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>).

Together, these data establish a key role for the bacterial &#x003b2;-H/C in eliciting inflammatory responses in the bladder including cytokine/chemokine synthesis and neutrophil infiltration, and in virulence by promoting the survival of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> in the bladder.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The mechanisms of pathogenesis, including the virulence factors and early steps in bladder colonization that influence the progression of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI, are not well defined. We have defined the capacity of previously characterized <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> strains, isolated from cases of acute cystitis and ABU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, to adhere to, invade and activate human bladder cells and MDMs <italic>in vitro</italic>, and colonize and trigger innate immune responses in the mouse bladder <italic>in vivo</italic>. A major finding of this study is that UPSA 807 is more adhesive to and invasive in bladder urothelial cells and MDMs compared to ABSA 834; proficient adherence of UPSA 807 to human cells parallels infection in mice where we observed UPSA 807 colonizes the bladder more efficiently than ABSA 834 as early as 30&#x02009;min post-infection. Strikingly, we found that proficient adherence of UPSA 807 to bladder cells leads to massive cytotoxicity via mechanisms that involve low-level, but significant, caspase-3 activation and cytolysis mediated almost entirely by the bacterial &#x003b2;-H/C. In addition, this study shows that the degree of early cytokine responses in the bladder, especially for IL-8 (KC in mice), IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and Rantes, are defined by the infecting strain; whereas UPSA 807 triggers rapid responses associated with acute bladder neutrophilia ABSA 834 fails to elicit these responses. Finally, we establish a key role for the &#x003b2;-H/C in inducing early chemokine responses and bladder neutrophilia, and also, paradoxically, the ability of UPSA 807 to survive in the bladder <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The finding of proficient adherence of UPSA 807 to urothelial cells and bladder tissue is in agreement with prior observations on the adherence capacity of UPSA to bladder cells and tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Notably, however, neither of these prior studies analyzed ABSA strains, cytotoxicity towards host cells, innate immune responses of chemokine activity and neutrophil infiltration, nor the role of the &#x003b2;-H/C in pathogenesis. The processes of adhesion to, invasion of and killing of host cells are well-described virulence strategies in the establishment of <italic>E. coli</italic> UTI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Thus, the results of the current study suggest that these processes are important in shaping the progression of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI as well. It is important, however, to interpret the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, that show a proficiency of UPSA 807 for these virulence traits, in view of the limitations of the model used; these include restricted analysis of time points and infection ratios, a potential for cytotoxicity-induced antibiotic exposure to affect bacterial counts and inability to replicate complex processes that underpin <italic>in vivo</italic> host-pathogen interactions, as reviewed elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Notwithstanding such limitations it is notable that the virulence characteristics of UPSA 807 in terms of the early interactions with host cells are not limited to bladder urothelial cells; our analysis of MDMs demonstrates that UPSA 807 also efficiently adheres to, is ingested by, and kills human macrophages. These cells are emerging as critical mediators of innate immune defense during UTI and also appear to modify effector adaptive immunity in the bladder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Future studies aimed at defining the role of macrophages in <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> infection in the bladder would thus be of interest.</p><p>Early cytokine responses are crucial first steps in the host response to infection that is aimed at eradicating bacteria from the bladder. The finding that UPSA 807 induces a more rapid and stronger pro-inflammatory response comprising IL-8, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 in urothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> compared to ABSA 834 within 6&#x02009;h p.i. was comparable to the responses observed <italic>in vivo</italic> that comprised KC and IL-6 but not IL-1&#x003b2;. These differences in IL-1&#x003b2; and other cytokine production observed at 6&#x02009;h p.i. probably reflect limitations in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, or species differences between human and mouse. However, broadly equivalent cytokine responses in urothelial cells and bladder induced by UPSA 807 and ABSA strains at 24&#x02009;h p.i. provide evidence that the innate immune system has a considerable capacity to detect and respond to ABSA with multiple cytokine responses, even if the responses are slower compared to those induced by UPSA 807. The stronger, more rapid pro-inflammatory responses observed for UPSA 807 infection support the emerging concept that pro-inflammatory responses can drive some UTI symptoms in mice and humans, as reviewed elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Heightened inflammatory responses, as a consequence of high bacterial burdens, have also been proposed to contribute to symptoms during <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> infection of joints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The findings of the current study are also of interest in the context of recent clinical findings that show that ABU <italic>E. coli</italic> elicits the synthesis of several innate immune mediators, and the degree of these innate responses are influenced by host genetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. The molecular basis of exaggerated host responses that drive disease versus attenuated responses that favor host defense have been shown to lie in promoter polymorphisms and transcription factor variants, as reviewed elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Thus, future studies of the impact of host genetic background towards the degree of innate immune response to <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI, and the factors of UPSA and ABSA that trigger these host responses, will be of interest.</p><p>We reasoned that divergent interactions between UPSA 807 and ABSA 834 and host cells are likely to be influenced by the distinctly different hemolytic activities of these strains, as well as potentially, differences in other factors such as capsular serotype, genetic sequence type, and different virulence gene repertoires. In this regard, we used an isogenic &#x003b2;-H/C-deficient mutant of UPSA 807 to determine the role of this known virulence factor in cytotoxicity, chemokine responses, bacterial fitness, and cell infiltration in the bladder during UTI. The finding of a major role of &#x003b2;-H/C in UPSA-driven cytotoxicity towards urothelial cells is consistent with findings in other disease models for <italic>S. agalactiae</italic>; for example, the &#x003b2;-H/C contributes to virulence mechanisms including cytotoxicity in dendritic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, cardiomyocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, lung epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and meningeal cells and astrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Rapid LDH release from cells infected with wt UPSA 807, but not its hemolysin-deficient mutant, suggests cytolytic non-apoptotic processes, such as pyroptosis, which can involve caspase-1 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. However, we did not detect significant caspase-1 activation in infected urothelial cells implicating non-pyroptotic cell death. While <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> can induce apoptosis in macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> this pathogen is also cytotoxic towards respiratory epithelial cells and elicits reactive oxygen species and apoptosis that encompasses caspase-3 and -9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. The low-level but statistically significant activation of caspase-3 in urothelial cells in response to infection with UPSA 807 is of interest because apoptosis in urothelial cells occurs following infection with uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>; the bacterial &#x003b1;-hemolysin activates caspase-3 in this cell death mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Together, the results of the current study show that the primary mechanism of host cell death induced by UPSA 807 in bladder cells is not via caspase activation, but instead, involves extensive cytolysis leading to rapid LDH release due to the expression of the bacterial &#x003b2;-H/C.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> &#x003b2;-H/C can also exert immunomodulatory effects on host cells including macrophages at sub-lytic concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Thus, the &#x003b2;-H/C can modulate innate immune functions beyond direct mechanisms of cell death. A recent study reported that <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> &#x003b2;-H/C promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in bladder urothelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and our findings are consistent with this report. It would be of interest to examine the role of the nucleotide oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptor (NLR) family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in this process since the &#x003b2;-H/C can promote the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of IL-1&#x003b2;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Another study showed that respiratory metabolism in <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> leads to higher cell numbers, driven by externally acquired haem and menaquinone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. This may be used to suggest that loss of &#x003b2;-H/C in UPSA 807 and attenuated host-cell lysis may compromise the bioavailability of host-derived haem <italic>in vivo</italic>, and affect the rates of respiration and cell division. Future studies would need to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>The massive neutrophil infiltrate observed in the bladder in response to infection with wt UPSA 807, but not its hemolysin-deficient mutant, establishes that the &#x003b2;-H/C elicits an acute local cell infiltrate. These findings are supported by the chemokine responses in the bladder involving IL-6, G-CSF, KC, Rantes and MIP-1&#x003b1;, and are consistent with a study that showed neutrophil migration across brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers triggered by <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> &#x003b2;-H/C in a process involving IL-8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Neutrophils are important in IL-1 family cytokine production and processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> and IL-1&#x003b2; aids in the control of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> dissemination to target organs, including the kidneys<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>; this was associated with impaired KC, MIP-2&#x003b1; and neutrophil responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p><p>The findings related to neutrophil infiltrates and bacterial survival in the bladder in the current study may be interpreted as a paradox given that major cellular infiltrates were associated with high bacterial loads for wt UPSA 807; in contrast, significantly lower bacterial loads for the &#x003b2;-H/C mutant were detected in parallel with a minimal neutrophil infiltrate. These data establish that while the &#x003b2;-H/C elicits cell infiltrates and contributes to the survival of UPSA 807 in the bladder <italic>in vivo</italic>, a massive neutrophil infiltrate does not necessarily enable efficient bacterial clearance. In other words, these data support the notion of subversion of innate immune defense mechanisms by <italic>S. agalactiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, whereby the &#x003b2;-H/C mediates improved bacterial survival despite a massive neutrophil response that it elicits. The findings of a role for the &#x003b2;-H/C in bacterial survival contrast with a reported dispensable role for the &#x003b2;-H/C in the establishment of UTI in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. It is possible that differences in strains or experimental methods between the current and prior study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> may account for these contradictory findings. We demonstrated striking differences in the hemolytic activities of the UPSA and ABSA strains used in this study, however the level of hemolytic activity of the <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> strain used in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> is not reported. In addition, the previous study does not report a significant difference between wt and <italic>cylE</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains in terms of cytotoxicity towards epithelial cells, perhaps signifying low-level hemolytic activity in this strain. Nonetheless, the findings of this study support a role for &#x003b2;-H/C in urothelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, as reported in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and other virulence functions such as resistance to neutrophils<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, and cytotoxicity towards epithelial cell barriers, which can lead to systemic infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.</p><p>The findings of the current study are particularly interesting in the context of the clinical origin of the UPSA and ABSA strains. On the one hand, the phenotypes of adhesion, invasion, and cytotoxicity correlate with the clinical presentations of acute UTI versus ABU; i.e. UPSA 807 has greater adhesive and cytotoxic properties compared to ABSA 834 and ABSA 1014 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. UPSA 807 also induces a stronger, more rapid cytokine response early following infection, particularly for IL-8/KC, Rantes and IL-6 (and IL-1&#x003b2; in human urothelial cells and MDMs but not mouse bladder) compared to ABSA 834. On other hand, both ABSA 834 and ABSA 1014 induced high levels of these cytokines, as well as multiple additional cytokines and chemokines, at 24&#x02009;h p.i., including G-CSF, MIP-1&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, and IL-1&#x003b2;; these findings were unexpected and underscore the work that is needed to understand the basis of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> ABU both clinically, and in experimental models. The degree to which these responses play a role in disease versus host defense is an area for future analysis. At the bacterial cell level, UPSA 807 is more hemolytic than ABSA 834 but less hemolytic than ABSA 1014. Notably, the finding that UPSA 807 is more cytotoxic towards urothelial cells compared to ABSA 1014 raises the intriguing question of the inability of ABSA 1014 to kill host cells despite high hemolytic activity. These data may reflect a different underlying host-pathogen interaction at the cell-cell interface, unique factors expressed in ABSA 1014 that promote host cell survival, or some intracellular responses that support host cell survival despite a high level of hemolytic activity. ABSA 1014 was cultured from an asymptomatic patient with ABU, which suggests that (i) hemolytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> is not a useful surrogate marker of the acute UTI-causing potential of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> strains, and (ii) hemolytic activity does not simply correlate with the degree of cytotoxicity towards eukaryotic cells. It is also possible that asymptomatic infection in the individual from whom ABSA 1014 was isolated was related to a reduced host response in the infected patient. There are some <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> factors other than the &#x003b2;-H/C that are also known to contribute to cytotoxicity; for example, lipoteichoic acid promotes internalization of bacteria and cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Finally, the complete absence of cytotoxicity observed in host cells infected with an isogenic &#x003b2;-H/C-deficient mutant of UPSA 807, in contrast to infection with the wt strain, shows a predominant role for this factor in the death of urothelial cells. This finding, that UPSA-driven cytotoxicity in urothelial cells is mediated almost entirely by the &#x003b2;-H/C, suggests a key role for this toxin in acute UTI at the interface between bacteria and the bladder.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI pathogenesis is subject to bacterial strain influences that affect adhesion to, invasion and killing of bladder cells, and the &#x003b2;-H/C that promotes urovirulence by eliciting inflammation and bacterial survival in the bladder. UPSA 807 is more adherent, invasive and cytotoxic towards urothelial cells compared to ABSA 834 and ABSA 1014. The mechanisms of host cell death mediated by UPSA 807 include low-level caspase-3 activation, and cytolysis. UPSA 807-induced cytotoxicity is mediated by the &#x003b2;-H/C. Collectively, the findings of this study support a model of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> UTI in which the &#x003b2;-H/C is a key factor in facilitating disease pathogenesis, bacterial virulence, and evasion of local innate defense in the bladder.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and primers</title><p>The previously characterized, clinically isolated strains of UPSA 807, ABSA 834 and ABSA 1014 used in this study are described elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.
