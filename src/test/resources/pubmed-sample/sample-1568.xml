The Rad23 family of proteins is known to bind ubiquitinated proteins through its two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, and may participate in the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome through docking via the Rad23 ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we investigate how the interaction between the UBL and UBA domains may modulate ubiquitin recognition and the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome by autoinhibition. We have explored a competitive binding model using specific mutations in the UBL domain. Disrupting the intramolecular UBL-UBA domain interactions in HHR23A indeed potentiates ubiquitin-binding. Additionally, the analogous surface on the Rad23 UBL domain overlaps with that required for interaction with both proteasomes and the ubiquitin ligase Ufd2. We have found that mutation of residues on this surface affects the ability of Rad23 to deliver ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the competition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway components for surfaces on Rad23 is important for the role of the Rad23 family proteins in proteasomal targeting.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Targeted protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a key means of regulating a wide variety of cellular processes, ranging from cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] to antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In this pathway, an enzymatic cascade covalently attaches ubiquitin to a lysine residue on substrate proteins. The subsequent conjugation of more ubiquitin moieties, each typically linked through Lys48 of ubiquitin, results in a polyubiquitin chain that directs substrate proteins to the proteasome where they are degraded (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). The importance of this proteasome-targeting step was demonstrated by experiments showing that the artificial localization of proteins to the proteasome is sufficient to cause their degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Recent work indicates that ubiquitin receptors, which bind ubiquitin but are not intrinsic subunits of the proteasome, facilitate the docking of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The best-studied of these receptors are the UBL-UBA proteins and include three groups: Rad23/HHR23A/HHR23B, Dsk2/PLIC1/PLIC2, and Ddi1. Rad23, for example, has been shown to play a role in the targeting of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 to the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and Ddi1 mediates degradation of the Ho endonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and of the F-box protein Ufo1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Each Rad23 family member has a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain that binds proteasomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as well as two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains that bind ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The structure of HHR23A has been solved by NMR spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which revealed that the UBL and UBA domains interact intramolecularly in a highly dynamic manner, as each UBA domain competes for an overlapping UBL domain surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The UBL domain of HHR23A has also been shown to bind to proteasomal subunit S5a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and notably, the UBL surface bound by S5a overlaps significantly with that bound by the UBA domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As with the UBL domain of HHR23A, the UBA domains also have multifunctional surfaces: specifically, the UBL- and ubiquitin-binding surfaces overlap. The binding of S5a or ubiquitin to HHR23A thus disrupts the intramolecular UBL-UBA interactions and drives HHR23A into an open conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We hypothesize that these conformational changes, governed by UBL-UBA interactions, are important for HHR23A function.</p><p>To determine how UBL and UBA domain interactions contribute to Rad23/HHR23A function in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, we identified mutations that disrupt UBL-UBA binding, then tested the ability of the mutant proteins to bind components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and to mediate delivery of a ubiquitinated substrate to the proteasome. Our results show that the interactions of the UBL and UBA domains with each other and with other proteins are interdependent, and that modulating proteasome-binding is important for the role of Rad23/HHR23 in proteasomal targeting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of UBL mutations that reduce UBA-binding</title><p>To identify UBL mutations that affect UBA-binding, we established an affinity column chromatography assay using resin-bound UBA domains and mobile ligands. To demonstrate that our assay can distinguish proteins based on their relative affinities for the UBA domains, control experiments were performed with ubiquitin and SUMO. Both proteins are similar in size and structure to the UBL domain but ubiquitin binds the UBA domains whereas SUMO does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Equal amounts of hemagglutinin-tagged SUMO (HA-SUMO), polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin (Ub-His), and FLAG-tagged wild-type HHR23A UBL (UBL-FLAG) were mixed and loaded onto the GST-HHR23A~&#x00394;UBL column. HA-SUMO eluted from the column first, followed by the wild-type UBL. Ub-His eluted from the column only when the salt concentration in the running buffer was increased from 150 mM to 400 mM (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1A</xref>). Therefore, the order in which ubiquitin, UBL and SUMO eluted from the GST-HHR23A~&#x00394;UBL column corresponded to their relative ability to interact with UBA domains. To confirm that the difference in retention time of each protein on the column is specifically due to their respective abilities to bind the UBA domains, we conducted a similar control experiment using a glutathione-sepharose column charged with GST only. HA-SUMO, Ub-His and UBL-FLAG all eluted from the GST column simultaneously (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1B</xref>).</p><p>To abrogate UBL-UBA binding, we mutated residues located on the UBA-binding surface of HHR23A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] that are conserved in the other human homolog of Rad23, HHR23B. We also considered data from previous structural studies of HHR23A, which showed that UBL-UBA binding is mediated mainly by hydrophobic interactions and that specificity is conferred by the topology of the binding surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The UBA-binding surface of the UBL domain is predominantly hydrophobic with a few basic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] whereas the UBL-binding surface of the UBA domains are similarly hydrophobic but with a few acidic residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Glutamic acid mutations in the UBA-binding surface would cause electrostatic repulsion against the UBA domains and thus be effective at disrupting the UBL-UBA interaction. Therefore, we mutated L10, K47 and T77 of HHR23A to glutamic acid, individually or in combination (as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Glutamic acid mutations in the UBL domain reduce binding to the UBA domains</bold>. (A) The electrostatic potential is mapped onto the surface diagram of the UBL domain of HHR23A. Positive and negative charges are indicated by blue and red respectively. GRASP was used to generate the surface diagram, using the parameters -25.4 to -12.7 and 25.4 to 12.7 kT to generate the surface potentials. (B) The ribbon diagram of the UBL domain of HHR23A was generated with MOLMOL [37], using reported UBL domain coordinates for HHR23A. (C) Equal amounts of wild-type UBL-His and mutated UBL-FLAG were loaded onto a GST-HHR23A~&#x00394;UBL column. The column was developed with PBS and fractions were collected for analysis by Western blotting, using antibodies against each epitope tag. Visualization of the proteins was performed with LI-COR's Odyssey Imaging System.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-9-4-1"/></fig><p>To determine the affinity of these UBL mutants for UBA domains relative to wild-type UBL, UBL domain constructs were mutated accordingly and tested in our affinity column chromatography assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, wild-type UBL began eluting off the column in fractions 18&#x02013;20 and the elution profile of the K47A UBL mutant is identical to that of the wild-type UBL domain. In contrast, the L10E/K47E double mutant began to elute in fraction 12 and the K47/T77E and K47E mutants in fraction 14. These data indicate that the glutamic acid UBL mutants, but not the alanine mutant, have a reduced ability to bind the UBA domains relative to the wild-type UBL.</p></sec><sec><title>HHR23A bearing UBA-binding mutations in the UBL domain show enhanced binding to polyubiquitin</title><p>The ubiquitin-binding surface on the UBA domains overlaps significantly with that involved in binding the UBL domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Disrupting the intramolecular UBL-UBA domain interactions is expected to make the UBA domains more accessible to ubiquitin. We probed the affinity of mutant HHR23A protein for ubiquitin binding by assessing the extent to which each competed with resin-bound GST-HHR23A for polyubiquitin-binding. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, polyubiquitin bound GST-HHR23A but not GST alone. As increasing amounts of untagged wild-type HHR23A was used as a competitor, the amount of polyubiquitin bound to GST-HHR23A decreased. As expected, HHR23A~&#x00394;UBL competed with GST-HHR23A more effectively than wild-type HHR23A for polyubiquitin-binding whereas the HHR23A L198A/L355A double mutant, in which the UBA domains are unfolded and thus unable to bind ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], did not compete at all.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>HHR23A mutations that disrupt the UBL-UBA interaction enhance ubiquitin-binding</bold>. (A) GST-HHR23A, untagged mutant HHR23A, free polyubiquitin chains, and glutathione-sepharose beads were mixed together. After the resin was washed, the bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting performed with an antibody against polyubiquitin. While all the bands are conjugates of free ubiquitin, the arrow indicates that which corresponds to tetraubiquitin. (B) The band corresponding to tetraubiquitin was quantified with a Biorad Fluor-S Max phosphoimager and data from a representative experiment are presented here.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-9-4-2"/></fig><p>The HHR23A UBL mutants were then tested as competitors in the GST-pulldown competition assay. All the bands in the polyubiquitin Western blot are conjugates of free ubiquitin, but rather than quantify a smear, we quantified the specific band corresponding to tetra-ubiquitin, which is the minimum length required for proteasomal targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The amount of tetra-ubiquitin bound to GST-HHR23A in the presence of competitor was then expressed as a percentage of the amount of tetra-ubiquitin bound in the absence of competitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). When wild-type HHR23A was used as a competitor, the amount of polyubiquitin bound to GST-HHR23A decreased from 87% to 39% as the ratio of competitor to GST-HHR23A was increased from 0.2 to 1. As expected, HHR23A~&#x00394;UBL was a more effective competitor than wild-type HHR23A, with only 75% of ubiquitin bound at a competitor to GST-HHR23A ratio of 0.2, and only 29% bound at a ratio of 1. This result is consistent with previous findings that HHR23A lacking the UBL domain exhibits higher affinity for polyubiquitin chains compared to the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the UBA domain double mutant L198A/L355A did not compete with GST-HHR23A for polyubiquitin binding. The UBL domain mutants L10E/K47E and K47E/T77E, which showed reduced UBA-binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), competed for ubiquitin-binding more effectively than wild-type HHR23A, and to a similar extent as HHR23A~&#x00394;UBL. Our results demonstrate that UBL-UBA domain interactions reduce HHR23A's ability to bind ubiquitin. They also provide evidence that the enhanced polyubiquitin-binding of HHR23A~&#x00394;UBL relative to wild-type HHR23A is due to loss of auto-inhibition mediated by UBL-UBA domain interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>UBA-binding mutations in the Rad23 UBL domain impair proteasome-binding</title><p>In addition to regulating ubiquitin-binding, UBL-UBA domain interactions could also affect proteasome-binding such that it is enhanced when the HHR23 proteins are bound to ubiquitinated proteins. For this hypothesis to be true, the proteasome must bind a surface on the UBL domain overlapping with that which binds the UBA domains. Indeed, the UBL domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the binding of HHR23A to S5a disrupts UBL-UBA domain binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we tested whether the UBA-binding surface of HHR23 family proteins is required for proteasome interaction.</p><p>Just as ubiquitin itself binds multiple subunits of the proteasome, including Rpn10/S5a and Rpt6/S6' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], so could the Rad23/HHR23 proteins. Therefore, we tested the ability of our UBL mutants, which are defective in UBA-binding, to interact with purified proteasomes instead of with specific subunits. We also used the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>as a model system as it is better-characterized and easier to manipulate genetically.</p><p>L10, K47 and T77 in HHR23A correspond to F9, K43 and S73 in Rad23 respectively, as determined by sequence alignment. We mutated these Rad23 residues to glutamic acid as we had done for HHR23A. To test proteasome-binding, we used recombinant, purified <sup>32</sup>P-labelled Rad23 proteins and purified yeast proteasomes in a electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In the presence of proteasomes, the mobility of wild-type Rad23, but not Rad23~&#x00394;UBL, decreased, as indicated by the arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The intensity of the shifted band is an indicator of the amount of proteasome-bound Rad23, which increased as more proteasome was titrated into the reaction. With the exception of the S73E mutant, the Rad23 UBL mutants showed no detectable interaction with the proteasome <italic>in vitro</italic>. This finding provides strong evidence that Rad23 binds the proteasome via the same surface that is responsible for S5a- and UBA-binding in HHR23A.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Rad23 UBL mutants show no detectable interaction with the proteasome <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>.

We thus tested whether our UBL mutants retain their ability to interact with Ufd2. We used bacterially expressed and purified GST-Ufd2 and Rad23 proteins in GST-pulldown experiments, following which the bound Rad23 proteins were detected by Western blotting for Rad23. As expected, wild-type Rad23 bound to GST-Ufd2 but not to GST alone, whereas Rad23&#x00394;UBL did not bind to GST-Ufd2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Interestingly, Ufd2-binding was significantly reduced by the mutation of F9, but not of K43 or of S73. This finding suggests that hydrophobic interactions govern Ufd2 binding to Rad23, and that the surfaces of Rad23 bound by Ufd2 and the proteasome do indeed overlap partially.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of Rad23 F9 reduces interaction with Ufd2</bold>.

Sic1 deubiquitination increased in the presence of wild-type Rad23 (lanes 3 and 4), most likely due to the ability of Rad23 to facilitate delivery of ubiquitinated Sic1 to the proteasome. Sic1 deubiquitination was blocked by Rad23~&#x00394;UBL (lane 5) and limited to the basal level in the presence of the F9E/K43E mutant, which showed no detectable binding to the proteasome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, Sic1 deubiquitination was enhanced by the S73E mutant, which retained proteasome-binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Our data support the model that binding to either proteasomes or polyubiquitin disrupts the UBL-UBA interaction, causing HHR23A to adopt an open conformation that facilitates its interaction with polyubiquitinated proteins or proteasomes respectively. This coupling of proteasome-binding and substrate-binding renders the Rad23 family more efficient in docking ubiquitinated substrates with the proteasome. Indeed, ubiquitin chains have been shown to enhance Rad23 binding to the proteasome <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Also, UBL-UBA domain interactions may enhance specificity by blocking interactions that are weaker than the intramolecular UBL-UBA interaction.</p><p>The UBA-binding surface of the Rad23/HHR23A UBL domain also mediates binding to the proteasomal subunit S5a as well as to other proteins such as the ubiquitin ligase Ufd2. We had targeted residues on the edge of the UBA-binding surface in an attempt to minimize disrupting other interactions but our mutations also affected proteasome-binding and Ufd2-binding. Our results are consistent with a previous report suggesting that the binding surfaces on the UBL domain for Ufd2 and the proteasome may overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The difficulty of specifically disrupting interaction with only one protein without affecting others suggests that these different binding surfaces overlap significantly on the UBL domain and that the various interactions may regulate one another. The use of the same surface on Rad23/HHR23A for both proteasome- and Ufd2-binding is consistent with a model in which Rad23 first binds ubiquitin conjugates associated with Ufd2, then dissociates from Ufd2 and binds the proteasome, to which the ubiquitin conjugates are thus delivered. This model contrasts with one in which Rad23 bridges Ufd2 and the proteasome by binding them simultaneously.</p><p>The UBL mutants tested constitute an allelic series, with the S73E mutant behaving most similarly to the wild-type UBL, following by K43E and then F9E. Despite the lack of detectable proteasome-binding in the native gel assay, which is based on fractionation of the interacting species, the UBL mutants possess sufficient residual affinity that they can still interact functionally with proteasomes, as evidenced by the deubiquitination of Sic1. Rad23&#x00394;UBL does not interact with proteasomes, yet it inhibited deubiquitination of Sic1. This dominant negative effect arises from a sequestering mechanism, as Rad23&#x00394;UBL can still bind ubiquitin chains and thus interfere with recognition by intrinsic ubiquitin receptors and other shuttling factors. In contrast, Sic1 was deubiquitinated in the presence of the UBL mutants in a manner that is consistent with each mutant's relative ability to bind proteasomes. These data indicate that the capacity of Rad23 to bind proteasomes is essential for the ability of Rad23 family proteins to target ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome. This model contrasts one in which ubiquitin chains bind the proteasome directly.</p><p>Interestingly, HHR23A does not dimerize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] whereas Rad23 does so in a manner that involves the C-terminal UBA domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Rad23 can also heterodimerize with other UBL-UBA proteins such as Ddi1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] while HHR23A interacts with hPLIC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, intermolecular UBL-UBA domain interactions may also play a regulatory role in the recruitment of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, both the intramolecular as well as intermolecular interactions of the UBL and UBA domains are important for the function of Rad23 family proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In this study we have shown that physical interactions between the UBL and UBA domains couple proteasome binding via the UBL domain with ubiquitin-binding via the UBA domain, thus priming Rad23/HHR23A for its role in shuttling ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>For bacterial expression, proteins were cloned into either pGEX-6p-1 (Pharmacia) or pET-23a (Novagen).
