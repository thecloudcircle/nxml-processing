Although fungal infection of central nervous system (CNS) rarely occurs in immunocompetent patients, its incidence is increasing in patients with AIDS. Among various fungal infections, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is most common in patients with HIV/AIDS, whose pathogenic organism is commonly found in the excrements of birds and invades the human CNS via inhalation and hematogenous spread.</p><p>The typical MRI signs of CNS cryptococcosis complicating AIDS before the use of HAART are dilated Virchow&#x02013;Robin spaces and cryptococcomas.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In these reports, soap-bubble such as lesions were described in the basal ganglia, midbrain peduncles, and nucleus dentate, indicating clusters of gelatinous pseudocysts.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, HAART is associated with decreased incidence of opportunistic infection, and in those that develop CNS Cryptococcus there may be a different manifestation in patients based on their HAART treatment.</p><p>Limited reports so far focus on radiological findings of cerebral cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients during the treatment by HAART.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In one of these reports, a case with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is described, with leptomeningeal enhancement and parenchymal edema by MR imaging.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In another report, the imaging findings in a larger cohort of 62 patients are analyzed for initial severity of the disease. It is found that high serum and/or CSF antigen titers are correlated with abnormalities demonstrated by MRI and HAART treatment fails to correlate with abnormalities demonstrated by MR imaging due to insufficiency of MRI data.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It has also been reported that leptomeningitis or meningoencephalitis are detected in all patients receiving HAART.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Other imaging findings include multiple cerebral cryptococcomas associated with immune reconstitution.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, the previous reports either are based on limited sample size or are single case report. More data is needed to compare the HAART treatment effect on imaging characterization of CNS cryptococcal infection.</p><p>CD4 T cells play an important role in the occurrence of opportunistic infections in HIV infected patients and the risk of opportunistic infection is especially high when CD4 T cell count is &#x0003c;100&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in the CNS has been found to be inhibited when CD4 T cells are present.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> However, no evidence has been reported showing the effect of CD4 T cell count on the imaging of crytococcal infection.</p><p>We hypothesized that the treatment of HAART and CD4 T cell count might affect the imaging characterization, especially lesion distribution of CNS cryptococcal infection in patients with AIDS. Based on the hypothesis and limitations of previous reports, we collected MRI data of CNS cryptococcal infection from a large cohort of patients that were enrolled from the hospitals specialized in infectious diseases in different regions of China. We also described the lesion distribution and compared the MRI characterization with the clinical data, such as CD4 T cell count and immune reconstitution effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 75 patients with AIDS and initial episodes of CNS cryptococcal meningoencephalitis between September 2012 and October 2014 were recruited into the study. All of the data were from different local hospitals specialized in infectious diseases in China and finally were analyzed at Department of Radiology both of Tianjin First Central Hospital and YouAn hospital affiliated of Capital medical university. The research protocol was approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committees.</p><p>All of the patients were diagnosed with AIDS based on positive HIV-1 antibody. The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencepgalitis was based on at least one of the following 3 findings: (1) isolated <italic>C. neoformans</italic> after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture; (2) positive CSF cryptococcal antigen (Ag) titer; (3) positive CSF India ink staining and clinical symptoms of meningitis.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> All of the patients received plain and contrast MR imaging, with imaging data available. MR imaging was performed 2 weeks before or after the clinical diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. None of the patients had a history of receiving antifungal therapy. In 1 case with cerebellar lesion, operation had been done.</p><p>Based on the above criteria for enrollment, 69 patients were enrolled. However, due to no abnormalities detected by MR imaging in 14 patients, 55 patients were finally eligible as the subjects of our study, including 42 men and 13 women, with their ages of 40&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;13 years ranging from 21 to 71 years. We also collected clinical data, such as the time of HIV diagnosis, therapeutic history of HAART, and CD4 T cell count.</p><p>MR imaging of the brain was performed on a 3.0 Tesla unit (Trio Tim, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). The sequences included sagittal T1-weighted spin-echo, T2-weighted turbo spin echo, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI-EPI, <italic>b</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1000&#x0200a;s/mm<sup>2</sup>). Gadolinium-DTPA was injected via antecubital vein at a dose of 0.1&#x0200a;mmol/kg magnevist (Bayer, Germany) with a 20&#x0200a;mL saline flush. The injection rate was 2&#x0200a;mL/s by using a power injector.</p><sec><title>Images Analysis</title><p>All of the images were evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists with 5-year experiences in diagnosing infection diseases complicating AIDS.

Based on distribution of the lesions detected by MR imaging, the subjects were divided into 2 groups. Group1 includes patients with their lesions involving the central parts of brain, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem, or central cerebellum. The lesions were visualized to be dilated Virchow&#x02013;Robin spaces, pseudocysts, or hazy brain base. Group 2 consisted of patients with lesions involving the superficial cerebral lobes and cerebellar hemisphere and the lesions have contrast enhancement. The distribution of the lesions was characterized based on FLAIR, DWI, and contrast imaging.

Based on distribution of the lesions, the patients were divided into 2 groups. The patients with superficial meningoencephalitis had significantly higher CD4 T cell count and more frequently use of HAART than the patients with central brain involvement.</p><p>As is known, the patients with AIDS sustain compromised cell-mediated immunity and are vulnerable to CNS cryptococcal infection. Uicker et al<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reported that CD4 T cell count is an important factor indicating acquired immune response against <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in an animal model of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. CD4 T cell contributes not only for clearance of cryptococci but also for leukocytic infiltration into the lesion of its CNS infection. In our present study, the patients with higher CD4 T cell count were shown with more obvious leptomeningitis or meningoencephalitis, indicating a good response to infection of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. It has also been reported that no or mild meningeal contrast enhancement is demonstrated in HIV-infected patients due to their immunodeficiency and immunogenic incompetence in recognizing polysaccharide capsule of cryptococcal organism.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In our group of patients with lower CD4 T cell count, the lesions commonly involved the central part of brain, with no detected contrast enhancement that is related to the compromised response to the infection.</p><p>Since the use of HAART in the year of 1997, the incidence of cryptococcal infection in CNS of AIDS patients has dramatically decreased across the world. The imaging appearances of cryptococcal infection in CNS are totally different from the pre-HAART era. The reason may be related with recovered host immunity triggering inflammatory responses to cryptococcal antigens.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> High levels of inflammatory cells in CSF are found which also correlates with meningeal enhancement.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Some studies have reported that HIV-infected patients undergoing treatment show typical MRI signs of leptomeningitis or meningoencephalitis.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Another study reported that treatment by HAART has no impact on the lesions demonstrated by imaging.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, in our present study, the patients undergoing a history of HAART are more vulnerable to combined with leptomeningitis or meningoencephalitis. Our findings are different from that previously reported possibly due to CD4 count of the patients and duration of HAART use.</p><p>In the pre-HAART era, Virchow&#x02013;Robin space, pseudocyst, and hazy brain base are the most common lesions in HIV-infected patients with CNS crytococcal infection.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Such lesions are commonly located at the basal ganglia and brain stem. The cerebellum can also be involved. Budding yeast such as cells and mucoid substances are found filling in the Virchow&#x02013;Robin spaces whose enlargements are able to result in pseudocysts. Soap-bubbles such as sign is detectable when multiple cysts accumulate together.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The lesion of hazy brain base was first described by Katchanov as parenchymal edema caused by fungal involvement to basal ganglia along the perivascular spaces.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>They also reported that the sign is often concurrent with infarction due to vasculitis of the minor perforating arteries. However in our subjects, 6 were demonstrated with hazy brain base, and its concurrence with infarction was found in only 2 cases.</p><p>In the group with superficial distribution of the lesions, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and cerebellum were the most commonly involved, especially cerebellum, with an involvement rate of 57.1%. Abscess had not been reported in the previous literature and concurrent abscess was found in our 5 cases, of which 1 case showed chronic granulomatous response containing large quantity of lymphocytes, macrophages, and foreign organisms. The presence of abscess also indicates the recovery of immunity after use of HAART and robust immune response to the infection.</p><p>Additionally, the present study does have some limitations. First, no follow-up data were collected to show the natural evolution and prognosis of the lesions in different groups of patients. Second, the clinical data, such as CSF culture, the duration of HAART use, and the occurrence of complications in other systems should be further investigated in correlation to MRI findings. Third, concurrence of IRIS with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis after the use of HAART could be further investigated for their differentiation. Fourth, further normal findings on MRI in HIV patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis should also be collected to compare the difference of CD4 counts and use of HAART.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, central and superficial distributions of the lesions detected by MR imaging in HIV-1-infected patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis are correlated with the CD4 count and the use of HAART. The basal ganglia are the most commonly involved location in the group with centrally distribution. The frontal, parietal lobe, and cerebellum are the most commonly involved locations in the group with superficially distribution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Jinping Wu &#x00026; Weixiang Song for providing cases of HIV infection, Shuo Yan for statistical analysis of the data, and Jinli Ding, Noel J for further editing of the writing.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AIDS = acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome, CD4 = cluster of differentiation 4 receptors, CNS = central nervous system, CSF = cerebrospinal fluid, DWI = diffusion weighted imaging, FLAIR = fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, HAART = highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus, IRIS = immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, T2WI = T2 weighted imaging, VRS = Virchow&#x02013;Robin spaces.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>SX, XL, YS, and JL equally contributed to the data collecting, analyzing, and paper editing.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: this study was supported by a grant from National Natural Scientific Grant (Hongjun Li, No. 81571634); Beijing natural science foundation (Hongjun Li, No. 7132108); The capital health research and development of special (Hongjun Li, No.2011-2018-01); Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals Clinical Medicine Development of Special Funding Support (Hongjun Li, No. ZYLX201511); National Natural Scientific Grant (Shinong Pan, No. 81271538).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Franco-Paredes</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Womack</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Bohlmeyer</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
