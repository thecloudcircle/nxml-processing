Depression negatively affects the way a person with depression thinks, feels and acts. The symptoms of depression are detected by the use of questionnaires (for example the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)), or diagnosed using a clinical interview such as the DSM or the ICD.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Among mothers in high-income countries, antenatal depression affects 7&#x02013;12%<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and postpartum depression affects 13&#x02013;18% within the first year after childbirth.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Depression causes personal suffering and weakens a person's ability to function in general. A woman with depression in the perinatal period is also faced by the challenges of the antenatal transition into motherhood, and after giving birth, the responsibility of taking care of her infant. Supportive parenting is known to be one of the strongest predictors of good outcomes for children.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Longitudinal studies from many countries show that positive, consistent and supportive parenting predicts low levels of child problem behaviour and child abuse, and also predicts enhanced cognitive development.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Conversely, harsh inconsistent parenting predicts a broad range of poor child outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Several studies have shown that increased levels of depressive symptoms in the parent are associated with less sensitive and harsher parenting behaviours.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Mothers with depression tend to demonstrate a flatter affect and be less sensitive, less responsive and less affectively attuned to their infants' needs, thus violating the infants' basic needs for positive interaction.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Maternal depression is a major risk for the infant. The first months of life are a highly sensitive period during which the infant is dependent on maternal care, and during which early brain and socioemotional development take place.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The negative impact of maternal depression on early child development is well documented and includes a broad range of child outcomes and increased susceptibility to psychopathology.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Maternal depression is frequently considered a unitary construct, but depressive symptoms do not follow a uniform course and there is a great diversity among mothers with depression.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In accordance with cumulative risk theories (the more stressors and risk factors a child is exposed to, the bigger their risk of developing mental illness), the most adverse child outcomes are linked to high-risk populations where the depressive symptoms occur in combination with risk factors such as poverty and comorbid psychopathology.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>The relationships between parental depression and such factors as parental competences, parental sensitivity, parent&#x02013;child relationship and child development are complex and still not fully explained. Parental depression may influence the child through three potential mechanisms: (a) a direct causal relationship through genetic inheritance of risk genes from parent to child, (b) through shared environmental factors during pregnancy that have an impact on both maternal depression and child development (for example poverty), and (c) through the influence of parental depression on parent behaviour, on the quality of the parent&#x02013;child relationship and on the overall functioning of the family, which lead to poorer outcomes for the child.<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec1-2" sec-type="other"><title>Existing research</title><p>Based on previous studies, we know that interventions that focus solely on the mother (such as medication or psychotherapy targeting the depressive symptoms) are insufficient to buffer against the potentially negative impact of psychopathology on the child's cognitive and psychosocial development, as well as attachment.<sup><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Previous reviews of the effects of interventions for parents with depressive symptoms that include outcomes on the parent&#x02013;child relationship or child development outcomes have focused on a broad range of psychological interventions aimed at treating depression in women with antenatal depression or postpartum depression.<sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> All reviews explicitly state that their results are either tentative or that evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions from. Still, five out of six reviews conclude that the interventions show promising results. Three of the reviews conducted meta-analyses.<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>The first review, published in 2011, focused on interventions aimed at enhancing maternal sensitivity, but did not address child developmental outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The second review, published in 2015, focused on psychological treatment of depression in mothers.<sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The study included meta-analyses of both the mother&#x02013;child relationship and child mental health outcomes, but mixed observational and parent-reported measures in the analyses. The third review, published in 2017 by Letourneau and colleagues, focused on interventions aimed at treating perinatal depression.<sup><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Their meta-analysis focused only on the effect of two types of interventions: interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT). Each meta-analysis included two studies only, which is not ideal.<sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>We found no previous reviews focusing specifically on the effect of interventions aimed at improving parenting including both the parent&#x02013;child relationship and child development outcomes. The objective of this review is therefore to systematically review the effects of parenting interventions on the parent&#x02013;child relationship and child development outcomes when offered to pregnant women or mothers with depressive symptoms who have infants aged 0&#x02013;12 months. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that aimed at improving parenting in a broad sense (such as Circle of Security<sup><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> or Minding the Baby<sup><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>) and that reported on the parent&#x02013;child relationship (for example attachment or parent&#x02013;child relationship) or child development (for example socioemotional or cognitive development) outcomes at post-intervention or follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Method</title><p>This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).

Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and, if necessary, a third reviewer was consulted.</p><p>We assessed risk of bias separately for each relevant outcome for all studies based on a risk of bias model developed by Professor Barnaby Reeves and the Cochrane Non-randomised Studies Method Group (Reeves, personal communication, 2019 from Reeves, Deeks, Higgins and Wells, unpublished data, 2011).

Effect sizes are reported using standardised mean differences (Cohen's <italic>d</italic>) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Data include post-intervention and follow-up means (or mean differences), raw s.d.s and sample size. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI. If a paper provided insufficient information regarding numeric outcome, the corresponding author was contacted. When available, we used data from adjusted analyses to calculate effect sizes. When adjusted mean differences were calculated, we used the unadjusted s.d.s to be able to compare effect sizes calculated from unadjusted and adjusted means. To calculate effect sizes, we used the Practical Meta-Analysis Effect Size Calculator developed by David B. Wilson, George Mason University and provided by the Campbell Collaboration.<sup><xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>Meta-analysis was conducted when outcome and time of assessment were comparable. When a single study provided more than one relevant measure, or only subscales of an overall scale for the meta-analysis, the effect sizes of the respective measures were pooled into a joint measure before being entered in the meta-analysis. One study consisted of three separate intervention arms and a shared control group.<sup><xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Since three effect sizes based on the same control group would not be independent, we calculated an effect size based on a mean of the three intervention groups' means and the mean of the control group.</p><p>Random-effects inverse-variance-weighted mean effect sizes were applied and 95% CIs were reported.

The socioeconomic status of the families included in the studies of this review is relatively high; most participants are of White ethnicity, and only a relatively small number of the participants have no education or limited education and/or a low income. This may contribute to the non-significant effect on the parent&#x02013;child relationship found in the meta-analysis and the generally non-significant results of the individual studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2" sec-type="other"><title>Interpretation of our findings and avenues for further research</title><p>Most studies included in this review used a screening questionnaire such as the EPDS to measure the level of depressive symptoms. A questionnaire is easy to use, but is also less precise than a depression diagnosis based on a clinical interview. Although the participants included in this review had a relatively high score on a depression screening questionnaire, they do not necessarily fulfil criteria for a clinical depression. The interventions might be effective if they were examined with a group of mothers with clinical depression, as such mothers may profit more from the intervention. Future studies could therefore be aimed at specific high-risk populations such as socioeconomically deprived mothers or women with clinical depression to examine if interventions are effective within such populations. Although there is a high correlation between antenatal depression and postpartum depression,<sup><xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> and the relationship with the child starts to form during pregnancy, none of the interventions of the included studies were initiated during pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> Therefore, screening for depression in pregnancy and starting treatment before the baby is born could be a focus for future research.</p><p>Previous reviews have pointed out that existing studies on psychological interventions for pregnant women or mothers with depression are few and have small sample sizes.<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Sample sizes of the studies included in this review ranged from 42 to 190 participants, which may have limited the power to detect significant effects. Although four of the studies included in this review include 100&#x02013;190 participants, the studies are generally still small in sample size and limited in number in this updated review. We did not find any systematic differences according to study size. Future studies should have a larger sample size to increase power. In order to examine mechanisms of change, careful considerations about the need for moderator or mediator analyses should be made <italic>a priori</italic>, as this increases the required sample size considerably.<sup><xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> Examples of possible moderators are socioeconomic status and depression level, and a possible mediator could be reflective functioning or sensitivity, depending on the theory of change in the examined intervention.</p><p>Several factors may moderate the effect of parenting interventions. First, intervention characteristics such as theoretical background may moderate the effect of parenting interventions. The interventions included in this review were, however, relatively comparable with regard to delivery, theoretical background and intensity. Most were home visits conducted by trained therapists, with weekly to monthly visits for a relatively short period.</p><p>Second, group format is widely used in parenting interventions and achieves change through the dual process of emotional experience and reflection in an interpersonal context.<sup><xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup> Group sessions provide a support network, reduce isolation and stigma, provide an environment in which to practice interpersonal and communication skills, and shape coping strategies and learning from each other. This may be important for mothers with depression as they may feel alone with their problems. We did not, however, find any studies that employed a group format. A group intervention (circle of security &#x02013; parenting) offered to mothers with depression is currently being evaluated in a RCT in Denmark.<sup><xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup> The group format enables several families to be treated at once, making it cheaper than individual interventions.</p><p>Finally, in recent years both practice and research have become much more aware of the important role fathers can play.<sup><xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></sup> The father&#x02013;child relationship might be especially important to both the mothers and the children in the context of maternal problems, such as depression, in which the father might buffer negative effects on children's socioemotional development. At the same time, non-optimal paternal behaviour and father&#x02013;child relationships might act as an additional risk factor for problematic child development.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup> It is therefore crucial to consider how fathers can be involved in the support offered to new families. None of the studies in this review, however, included fathers in the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3" sec-type="other"><title>Limitations</title><p>We chose to include only RCTs or quasi-RCTs in the review to ensure high methodological quality and to minimise the risk of confounding factors. We consider this a strength of the review, but it may have reduced the number of included studies, thereby making it more difficult to find comparable studies for meta-analyses. Likewise, the small number of included studies hindered subgroup analysis, which must be considered a limitation. Although some studies did report short- or long-term follow-up outcomes, it was not possible to conduct meta-analysis on any follow-up outcomes. Consequently, we cannot say anything about the effects over time.</p><p>Another limitation that stems from the reviewed studies is that although the two most recent studies<sup><xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> addressed implementation issues such as details about certification, supervision, fidelity and variation in the number of intervention sessions received, most studies only provide limited information about training. Therefore, when comparing across studies, we do not have a clear picture of how well the interventions were delivered and whether the results could have been affected by implementation difficulties. A final limitation is that only studies conducted in Western Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries were included in this review. Since cultural norms and values related to parenting vary considerably across countries,<sup><xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup> we chose to focus on the effectiveness of interventions offered to families in high-income countries in this review. However, the majority of the world's population lives in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, it is important to conduct similar reviews focusing on studies from low- and middle-income countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-4" sec-type="other"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>This review, based on seven studies, provides no evidence for the effect of parenting interventions for mothers with depressive symptoms on the parent&#x02013;child relationship immediately after the intervention ended. As meta-analysis for child development or follow-up assessments could not be done, it remains unclear whether there are any effects on these outcomes. Despite the current accepted need to intervene within the first 1000 days of a vulnerable child's life, and the fact that parental depression can have serious developmental consequences for the child, we still lack high-quality studies to inform practice about how best to support vulnerable families. We also still lack systematic reviews that examine the effects of interventions for mothers with depression outside high-income countries.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge and thank information specialists Anne-Marie Klint J&#x000f8;rgensen and Bj&#x000f8;rn Christian Arleth Viinholt for running the database searches, Rikke Eline Wendt for being involved in the review process, Therese Lucia Friis, Line M&#x000f8;ller Pedersen, Louise Scheel Hjorth Thomsen and Emilie Jacobsen for conducting the screening and senior researcher Trine Filges and senior researcher Jens Dietrichson for statistical advice.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="supplementary-material"><title>Funding</title><p>S.B.R. and I.S.R. were supported by a grant from the Danish Ministry of Social Affairs and Interior.
