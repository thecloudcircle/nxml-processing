In this paper, we evaluated the impact of 2' sugar moiety substitution for different nucleotides on being substrates for SAMHD1 and mechanisms of actions for the results. We found that dNTPs ((2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-H) are only permissive in the catalytic site of SAMHD1 due to L150 exclusion of (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-F and (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-OH nucleotides. However, arabinose ((2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-OH) nucleoside-5'-triphosphates analogs are permissive to bind in the catalytic site and be hydrolyzed by SAMHD1. Moreover, when the (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2' sugar moiety is increased to a (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-methyl as with the SMDU-TP analog, we detect inhibition of SAMHD1&#x02019;s dNTPase activity. Our computational modeling suggests that (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-methyl sugar moiety clashing with the Y374 of SAMHD1. We speculate that SMDU-TP mechanism of action requires that the analog first docks in the catalytic pocket of SAMHD1 but prevents the A351-V378 helix conformational change from being completed, which is needed before hydrolysis can occur. Collectively we have identified stereoselective 2' substitutions that reveal nucleotide substrate specificity for SAMHD1, and a novel inhibitory mechanism for the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1. Importantly, our data is beneficial for understanding if FDA-approved antiviral and anticancer nucleosides are hydrolyzed by SAMHD1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI049781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Baek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Baek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH100999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schinazi</surname><given-names>Raymond F.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH AI049781 (B.K.), GM104198 (B.K.), and MH100999 (R.F.S.).

The dNTP triphosphohydrolase activity occurs in the HD domain of SAMHD1. The dNTPase activity appears to require homotetramer complex assembly, which is regulated by sequential binding of allosteric activators [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However the SAMDH1C (120&#x02013;626) truncated protein, which cannot form homotetramers, has been shown to have dNTPase activity [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Further studies are needed to determine if putative interacting protein partners, Aicardi&#x02013;Gouti&#x000e8;res syndrome mutations, other point mutations or other truncation mutants of SAMHD1 may block homotetramerization while still permit dNTPase activity [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>It has been shown that SAMHD1 inhibits retrovirus infection, most likely by acting as a key regulator for cellular dNTPs levels, which can influence such infection [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent reports indicate that T592 phosphorylation of SAMHD1 also influences retrovirus restriction in myeloid cells and can modulate triphosphohydrolase activity [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, SAMHD1 has been investigated in the context of how cellular dNTP concentrations influence the efficacy of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for lentiviral infection [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nucleoside derivatives&#x02013;ribonucleoside, 2'-deoxyribonucleoside or arabinose nucleoside analogs&#x02013;are antimetabolites, which represent an important class of chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancers and viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These antimetabolites enter the cell through active transport mechanisms and require phosphorylation by several cellular kinases to produce their monophosphate (MP), diphosphate (DP) and triphosphate (TP) analog forms. In addition, certain 2'-deoxynucleoside-5'-TP analogs, arabinose nucleoside-5'-TP analogs and dUTP can compete with naturally occurring canonical dNTPs as substrates for host DNA polymerases or viral DNA polymerases [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This competition promotes mutagenesis and apoptosis of cancer cells or termination of viral replication [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, maintaining a proper cellular dNTP balance is important biologically for ensuring DNA fidelity during replication and repair [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In this study we specifically explore the effect of stereoselective 2' substitution of nucleoside analogs on SAMHD1 activity. We use computational modeling to place our results into a structural context that may help better understand the larger mechanistic details of SAMHD1 substrate specificity. The L150 and Y374 of SAMHD1 have been proposed to contribute to the formation of a tight catalytic pocket [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Using an HPLC-based assay, we found that the L150 of SAMHD1 acted as a steric gate to prevent (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-F-dCTP and CTP from being hydrolyzed by SAMHD1, which supports published results [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Modeling of the catalytic site with dCTP and ara-CTP ((2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-OH) did not show a clash with Y374, whereas SMDU-TP analog did show a clash. Biochemical analysis showed that dCTP and ara-CTP were substrates for SAMHD1, whereas SMDU-TP blocked dNTPase activity of SAMHD1. Y374 is part of a helix that undergoes a conformational change to move closer to the dNTP [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We hypothesize that the (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-methyl substituted nucleotide (SMDU-TP) blocks the helix conformation change at the catalytic site, providing a novel mechanism for inhibiting the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1. Collectively, our data show that stereoselective 2' substitution for nucleotides can impact the substrate specificity and dNTPase activity of SAMHD1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Compounds</title><p>Gemcitabine (2',2'-diF-dC), arabinose-C (ara-C; aka cytarabine), dCMP were purchased from Sigma.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g008">Fig 8</xref>, we compile our results for what we know will influence nucleotides to be substrates for SAMHD1. Ji <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that L150 and Y374 of SAMHD1 form a tight catalytic pocket to exclude rNTPs. The L150 would essentially act as a steric gate to exclude rNTPs from the catalytic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Our computational modeling indicates that only a dNTP can fit in the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), but larger (2&#x02019;<italic>R</italic>)-2&#x02019;-F or (2&#x02019;<italic>R</italic>)-2&#x02019;-OH moieties are excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g002">Fig 2C and 2E</xref>). A HLPC-bases assay confirmed that (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-F and (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-OH are not substrates for SAMHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g002">Fig 2D, 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169052.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, the L150 acts by a steric gate mechanism, i.e. clashing of the L150 with the (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-F/OH moiety to exclude these nucleotides from docking in the catalytic pocket of SAMHD1. Our computational modeling indicates that (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-H and (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-OH sugar moieties can fit within the catalytic site of SAMHD1, while (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-methyl moiety clash with Y374 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Biochemical analysis showed that both dCTP ((2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-H) and ara-CTP ((2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-OH) are hydrolyzed in the presence of SAMHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). We therefore postulate that ara-CTP, ara-ATP, ara-GTP, fludarabine-TP, cladribine-TP, and clofarabine-TP would be sensitive to hydrolysis by SAMHD1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Interestingly, the SMDU-TP analog ((2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-methyl) blocked the triphosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 in the biochemical assay, making it a nucleotide inhibitor of SAMHD1. To address why SMDU-TP inhibits the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1, we postulate that SMDU-TP prevents the full A351-V378 helix 10&#x000c5; movement towards a dNTP substrate in the catalytic pocket [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This mechanism is very different from the SAMHD1 inhibitor, pppCH<sub>2</sub>dU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), which acts by preventing tetramer formation and is a non-cleavable substrate for SAMHD1 [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This means that (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2' substituted nucleotides has access to and bind within the catalytic pocket of SAMHD1. For our mechanism to work, the final changes with the A351-V378 helix movement is completed after the dNTP is docket within the catalytic site. Once the helix conformational change is completed then hydrolysis of the nucleotide analog occurs. For SMDU-TP, the (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-methyl clashes with Y374 preventing the helix from completing the conformational change and thus blocks hydrolysis. If our model is correct, then we would predict that sapacitabine (CYC682) and DFP-10917, which have a (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-cyano (CN) moiety, would also dock within the catalytic pocket of SAMHD1 and then inhibit the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Sapacitabine and DFP-10917 are currently under clinical investigation as anticancer nucleoside compounds.</p><fig id="pone.0169052.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0169052.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Determining nucleotide analog specificity for SAMHD1.</title><p>A) Modification of the 2' sugar position of a nucleotide can lead to several different outcomes. First, (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-F and (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-OH sugar moieties have been shown not to be substrates for SAMHD1. Additional analogs with (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-F and (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-OH sugar moieties would be predicted not to be substrates for SAMHD1. Second, canonical dNTPs and the non-canonical dUTP are substrates for SAMHD1. Our data shows that ((2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-OH) arabinose nucleoside-5'-triphosphates are also substrates for SAMHD1. Therefore, we also predict several other arabinose nucleoside analogs would be substrates for SAMHD1. Moreover, clofarabine-TP ((2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-F) was reported hydrolyzed by SAMHD1 [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Finally, we found the SMDU-TP, (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-methyl sugar moiety, inhibited the triphosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1. We postulate that the (2'<italic>R</italic>)-2'-methyl moiety may prevent the conformational change in the catalytic site of SAMHD1 due to the size of the methyl group clashing with Y374. Therefore, we predicted that nucleotides with a (2'<italic>S</italic>)-2'-cyano moiety may also inhibit dNTPase activity of SAMHD1. B) A SAMHD1 inhibitor has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The pppCH<sub>2</sub>-dU analog has a 5'-methylene modification, making the analog non-hydrolysable in the catalytic site, but also was shown to block homotetramerization when present in the A2 site [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. C) Modification of the 3'-OH sugar moiety is not permissive. NRTIs and ddNTPs lack a 3'-OH moiety, making them chain terminators for DNA polymerases, are not substrates for SAMHD1. D) Base modifications for different nucleoside analogs are permissive substrates for SAMHD1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0169052.g008"/></fig><p>Additional aspects of nucleoside analogs are also examined. The 3' position of the sugar is of high importance in determining which deoxynucleoside-5'-triphosphate analogs have the potential to be substrates for SAMHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Ji <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that the 3'-OH sugar moiety has hydrogen bond interactions with D319 and Q149 of SAMHD1 to promote correct alignment of the dNTP in the catalytic pocket [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The FDA-approved antiviral NRTIs, such as zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), zalcaiabine (ddC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), didanosine (ddI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), and abacavir (ABC) were shown not to be substrates for SAMHD1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (this study and [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Additionally, we show that ddATP and ddGTP are not substrates for SAMHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Collectively these data validate Ji <italic>et al</italic>. biochemical structure model, indicating that 3'-OH sugar moiety is an essential function group of the nucleoside for SAMHD1 substrate specificity [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169052.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, the type of base or being modified does not restrict a nucleotide analog from being a substrate for SAMHD1. Presently, all canonical bases and modified bases analogs: decitabine-TP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169052.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), dUTP, 2-amino-2'-dATP, O6-methyl-2'-dGTP, 5-methyl-2'-dCTP and 2-thio-dTTP are hydrolyzed by SAMHD1 [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, we postulate the following non-canonical FDA-approved nucleosides: cladribine, floxuridine, trifluorothymidine, and sorivudine, when phosphorylated in the cell, are strong candidates for being SAMHD1 substrates <italic>in vivo</italic>. These are nucleosides used for anticancer and antiviral treatments.</p><p>Biologically, both ribonucleotide reductase and SAMHD1 have roles in maintaining proper intracellular dNTP concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. SAMHD1-deficient mice have a dNTP imbalance, with higher intracellular dATP and dGTP concentrations than dTTP and dCTP concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and a cellular dNTP imbalance can promote higher rates of mutagenesis in cancer cells, and influence the ability of DNA viruses to infect cells [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169052.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. One can imagine that a SAMHD1 nucleoside analog inhibitor might be useful in an anticancer regiment by promoting a dNTP imbalance in rapidly dividing cancer cells or in combination therapy with FDA-approved nucleoside analogs that are sensitive to hydrolysis by SAMHD1. Alternatively, increasing SAMHD1 levels in cancer cells may slow cell growth by decreasing dNTP concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0169052.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].
