In this study, we analyze heterogeneity in the responses to hypothalamic secretagogues in the corticotroph cell population of adult male rats. Using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s, we determined the intracellular calcium responses of these cells to corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine-vasopressin. Our experiments revealed marked population heterogeneity in the response to these peptides, in terms of amplitude and dynamics of the responses, as well as the sensitivity to different concentrations and duration of stimuli. However, repeated stimuli to the same cell produced remarkably consistent responses, indicating that these are deterministic on a cell-by-cell level. We also describe similar heterogeneity in the sensitivity of cells to inhibition by corticosterone. In summary, our results highlight a large degree of heterogeneity in the cellular mechanisms that govern corticotroph responses to their physiological stimuli; this could provide a mechanism to extend the dynamic range of the responses at the population level to allow adaptation to different physiological challenges.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>We show prominent heterogeneity in several aspects of the calcium responses to hypothalamic secretagogues in corticotrophs of adult male rats.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Variability in homotypic cell function is a ubiquitous feature in biology, appearing in a wide range of situations, such as gene expression (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>), gene networks (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), molecular pathways (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>), and cell behavior (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This &#x0201c;biological noise&#x0201d; can result from complex nondeterministic molecular dynamics at the microscopic level, and it has been proposed to have an important role in cell and tissue function (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). For instance, it can be instrumental in guaranteeing reliable firing in neurons (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); in systems dominated by negative feedback loops, noise can be important for inducing oscillations (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and it can be important in the generation of intracellular calcium oscillations (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>In this study we consider the role of cell variability in the function of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis, a major physiological regulator of the hormonal stress response. Adrenocortical production and release of corticosteroids [cortisol in humans and corticosterone (CORT) in rodents] is controlled by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from pituitary corticotroph cells, which are activated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) released from hypothalamic neurons (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>). CRH and AVP increase the electrical activity of corticotroph cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and increase intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>); furthermore, these two neuropeptides have been shown to act in a synergistic manner to enhance the secretion of ACTH (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>). The physiological importance and potential impact of corticosteroids on the function of almost all organs leads to the requirement for tightly controlled stress responses; this control is achieved principally through CORT negative feedback both at the level of the pituitary gland and of the hypothalamus (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Although previous studies have highlighted marked heterogeneity in the response of corticotrophs to hypothalamic stimuli (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>), it is unclear whether this population variability derives from stochastic responses of corticotrophs, or whether individual cells respond in a deterministic manner, with differences between subpopulations of corticotrophs. In this study we investigate the heterogeneity in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses in the corticotroph population: their spontaneous activity, CRH- and AVP-evoked increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and their synergy, as well as the effect of CORT exposure on these responses. We show that whereas intrinsic responses of a single cell to repeated challenge are deterministic and reproducible, the corticotroph population displays marked cell-to-cell variability in all of these processes. This property may provide a mechanism that extends the dynamic range and regulates corticotroph output, allowing for appropriate population-level responses and adaptation to different physiological challenges.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Animals</title><p>For all of the experiments, 8- to 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were kept under standard 12-hour light/12-hour dark conditions, with food and drink supplied <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p><p>All tissue collection was performed between 9:00 and 11:00 <sc>am</sc>, in accordance with accepted standards of humane animal care, as well as UK Home Office requirements (PPL 60/4349) and University of Edinburgh Ethical Review Committee approval.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Generation of POMC-GCAMP6s lentivirus</title><p>The POMC-GCAMP6s lentiviral reporter construct was generated using a pLenti backbone from Addgene plasmid no. 20946.

Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. After rapidly dissecting the pituitary from a rat, the anterior lobe was isolated with the aid of a scalpel under a dissecting microscope to remove the POMC-expressing melanotrophs of the intermediate zone. The anterior lobes were roughly chopped with a blade, then transferred into a tube containing 2.5 mL of digestion medium [Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 25 mM HEPES, 207 U/mL trypsin, and 36 U/mL DNAse I in DMEM). After 30 to 45 minutes of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, when most of the tissue was digested, cells were further dissociated mechanically using the tip of a micropipette. The digestion was then blocked using 5 mL of blocking medium (25 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100U/mL aprotinin, and 36 U/mL DNAse I in DMEM).

In 40% of the recorded cells, CRH responses were attenuated, and &#x0003c;50% in magnitude, when compared with the response to AVP in the same cell [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(b)</xref>]. The AUC of the combined treatment was then compared with the sum of the areas of the single treatments. Although the AUC of the combined treatment was not statistically different from the sum of the single treatments when considering the population [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(c)</xref>], in 20 of 51 cells (39.2%) the AUC of the combined treatment was greater than the sum of the single treatments.</p><fig id="F4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>(a) Fifteen-minute excerpts from recordings of three corticotrophs treated sequentially with 2 nM AVP, 200 pM CRH, and the combination of the two, showing different levels of synergistic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.

Heterogeneity in CORT effects was again apparent, ranging from immediate reduction of the responses to reduction in their amplitude or their duration. Analysis of the entire population of cells showed that the reduction in calcium responses was statistically significant between 30 and 90 minutes after CORT exposure [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5(d)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5(f)</xref>].

The dynamics of inhibition from CORT exposure differed among the three treatments: specifically, an immediate decrease of the response was seen in four of the nine cells treated with CRH [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(g)</xref>, left], whereas at the same time CORT was only able to inhibit one of nine cells treated with AVP or two of 12 cells treated with CRH plus AVP [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(g)</xref>, middle and right]. Thirty minutes after CORT exposure, more than half of the cells treated with either CRH or AVP were inhibited, and this inhibition lasted to a similar level for up to 90 minutes of exposure to CORT both in terms of AUC [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5(d)</xref>] and of percentage of cells inhibited [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(g)</xref>].

Different degrees of functional heterogeneity in the response to secretagogues have been reported for a number of pituitary cell populations, including somatotrophs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), gonadotrophs (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), lactotrophs (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and corticotrophs (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), suggesting this as an efficient evolutionary mechanism to enhance hormonal responses from the pituitary gland. In this study, we have used changes in corticotroph [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which have been related to changes in membrane capacitance, indicative of ACTH granule fusion and thus secretion (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), to determine cellular heterogeneity in hypothalamic stimulation and feedback regulation. We report a marked heterogeneity in the responses to secretagogues in rat corticotrophs, which is apparent at multiple levels when analyzing intracellular calcium responses. Our data suggest that a deterministic mechanism underlies the regulation of corticotroph cells to generate appropriate physiological responses to stressors.</p><p>In our study, heterogeneity of corticotroph cell activity was already apparent when spontaneous calcium activity was monitored; corticotrophs from male rats showed a variety of behaviors, ranging from being &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; (the majority), to having high spontaneous activity. Heterogeneity in corticotroph spontaneous electrical activity has been previously reported in both male and female mice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13, 23, 29</xref>). Interestingly, an earlier study in female rat corticotrophs identified by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) reported spontaneous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity in 65% of cells, possibly indicating the presence of sex differences in the activity of these cells.</p><p>When cells were challenged with hypothalamic secretagogues, further heterogeneity in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity was apparent in the pattern, duration, and dose-sensitivity of the response. Strikingly, marked heterogeneity was seen between cells in terms of the intensity and duration of the response, and this was deterministic for each cell. Heterogeneity in calcium responses of corticotrophs to high concentrations of AVP has been previously noted as a result of the activation of different ionic currents in these cells (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Variability in the basal and CRH-stimulated secretion of ACTH, as measured by reverse hemolytic plaque assay, has also been previously described in corticotrophs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), suggesting that this heterogeneity is relevant for endocrine signaling. Similarly, variable activation of c-Fos after a CRH stimulus has been previously noted in adult male rat corticotrophs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Whether this variability of responses implies the existence of subpopulations of corticotrophs is unclear; electron microscopic observations have shown morphological differences in the corticotroph population, suggesting the existence of four different subtypes of corticotrophs (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), although functional correlates of these anatomical differences have not been described. At the molecular level, three subpopulations of corticotrophs have been identified in sheep fetuses in relationship to their gene expression signature after stress (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). It is not at present known whether these represent real subpopulations of cells of different origin. Rather than thinking of static subpopulations of cells, it is reasonable to assume that the specific &#x0201c;fingerprint&#x0201d; of channel expression in each cell, and variability in their amount, will determine its specific response, and that this may change over time. Mathematical modeling of experimental data suggests that cell-to-cell variations in even a small number of currents are sufficient to generate variation in spontaneous and secretagogue-induced electrical activity in corticotrophs (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>); similarly in lactotrophs, variation in calcium responses has been proposed to depend mainly on variation in calcium extrusion from membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> adenosine triphosphatase, and on cell-to-cell differences in endoplasmic reticulum calcium levels (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Previous studies have shown marked anatomical and functional plasticity in corticotrophs during different physiological states (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), suggesting that corticotrophs may be a single population that can exist in a large spectrum of states, with individual cells switching state following stimuli of different type or intensity. Similarly, we found that increasing doses of CRH had the effect of both increasing the magnitude of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses and of recruiting more cells to respond. A recent study showed a similar dose-dependent increase in the number of cells showing calcium responses in response to CRH treatment in mice (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Interestingly, the same study reports inhibition of calcium responses at CRH concentrations higher than those used in our study. Dose-dependent discrete activation of subpopulations of cells has been described in terms of hormone secretion from corticotrophs (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), as well as from gonadotrophs (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and somatotrophs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and it has also been noted in nonpituitary systems (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This combination of &#x0201c;analogue&#x0201d; (size of response) and &#x0201c;digital&#x0201d; (percentage of responding cells) could permit an increase in the dynamic range of cellular responses by encoding stimuli both at the single-cell and at the population level. Furthermore, this heterogeneity in responses to secretagogues may allow linear responses to a large range of stimuli, in a similar fashion to that of vasopressin neurons, where it has been described as enabling a linear output from a nonlinear population of cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, there was no constant relationship between the responses of corticotrophs to the two hypothalamic stimuli. Elevation of intracellular calcium following a CRH stimulus is predominantly nifedipine-sensitive and dependent on calcium influx via activation of <sc>L</sc>-type calcium channels (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40, 41</xref>). In contrast, increase in intracellular calcium following AVP stimulation is largely dependent on release from intracellular calcium stores (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In our experiments, nifedipine inhibited responses to a combination of CRH and AVP in a variable, cell-dependent way, suggesting that the relative nifedipine-sensitive and -insensitive components of the responses were heterogeneous in the population. This was further confirmed when treating the same cells in sequence with the two independent stimuli; responses were observed ranging from strong responses to both CRH and AVP to attenuated responses to either factor.</p><p>An important characteristic of ACTH secretion from corticotrophs is that the two hypothalamic secretagogues CRH and AVP act in a synergistic manner; this has been previously described in primary rat anterior pituitary cultures (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 43</xref>) as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This synergy is also reflected at the level of second messenger production, where potentiation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production in the presence of both hormones is mediated by the activation of adenylate cyclase and inhibition of phosphodiesterases (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Furthermore, activation of protein kinase C has also been implicated in the generation of synergistic responses, through inhibition of TREK currents (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Our data show that, although at the population level no significant synergistic calcium responses are seen, at the level of single cells, &#x0223c;40% of cells show synergistic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to CRH and AVP; this further supports the notion that intracellular pathways are heterogeneous in the corticotroph population.</p><p>Finally, we have analyzed the effects of CORT on the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses of corticotrophs. The effects of CORT on the activity of corticotrophs are well known; pretreatment with CORT for 90 minutes has been shown to decrease firing rate and event duration measured from single corticotrophs (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Treatment with CORT has been shown to gradually reduce CRH- or AVP-induced ACTH secretion from perfused pituitary cells in a time frame similar to the population data from our study (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46, 47</xref>). Our results show a progressive recruitment of cells for the response to glucocorticoids, during the course of 90 minutes, which could be instrumental for the generation of gradual responses to CORT. This is in agreement with data showing a decrease in the number of plaque-forming corticotrophs in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), although in that study cells were pretreated with CORT for several hours. Furthermore, the effects of CORT were less pronounced when cells were treated with both CRH and AVP compared with when a single secretagogue was used. This is in line with recent electrophysiological reports showing that treatment with CRH plus AVP is able to overcome CORT-induced hyperpolarization of corticotrophs, whereas CRH alone is not (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that a high degree of heterogeneity exists in the corticotroph population at the level of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to hypothalamic secretagogues, synergistic responses to CRH and AVP, as well as CORT inhibition. This highlights the importance of performing single-cell analysis when considering regulatory and feedback mechanisms controlling pituitary gland output, because integration of variable cell responses may be an important component underlying the function of endocrine systems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="abbr" fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">ACTH</term><def><p>adrenocorticotropic hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">AUC</term><def><p>area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">AVP</term><def><p>arginine-vasopressin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub></term><def><p>intracellular calcium concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">CORT</term><def><p>corticosterone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">CRH</term><def><p>corticotropin-releasing hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">DMEM</term><def><p>Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">Ig</term><def><p>immunoglobulin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">PBS</term><def><p>phosphate-buffered saline.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title></ack><ack><p content-type="financial-disclosure">This work was supported by Medical Research Council Grant J008893 (to M.J.S.), which supported N.R.
