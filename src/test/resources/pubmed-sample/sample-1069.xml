Atherosclerosis is mainly linked to dysfunction in vascular endothelial cells and subendothelial accumulation of oxidized forms of LDL. In the present study, we investigated the role of myeloperoxidase oxidized LDL (Mox-LDL) in endothelial cell dysfunction. We studied the effect of proinflammatory Mox-LDL treatment on endothelial cell motility, a parameter essential for normal vascular processes such as angiogenesis and blood vessel repair. This is particularly important in the context of an atheroma plaque, where vascular wall integrity is affected and interference with its repair could contribute to progression of the disease. We investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> the effect of Mox-LDL on endothelial cells angiogenic properties and we also studied the signalling pathways that could be affected by analysing Mox-LDL effect on the expression of angiogenesis-related genes. We report that Mox-LDL inhibits endothelial cell motility and tubulogenesis through an increase in miR-22 and heme oxygenase 1 expression. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that Mox-LDL interferes with parameters associated with angiogenesis. They suggest that high LDL levels in patients would impair their endothelial cell capacity to cope with a damaged endothelium contributing negatively to the progression of the atheroma plaque.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. According to the 2005 World Health Organization report, CVD is responsible for 30% of all deaths globally. CVD commonly stems from vascular dysfunction, which is mainly linked to atherosclerosis. The accumulation of oxidized forms of LDL (ox-LDL) in the intima of blood vessels is widely accepted to play a major role in the development of atheroma plaques. LDL particles are oxidized<italic> in situ</italic>; small amounts can also be found in the circulation and are therefore in contact with the endothelial cells (ECs) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Wherever these particles are modified, myeloperoxidase (MPO) is nowadays the best candidate as an<italic> in vivo</italic> actor in LDL modification whereas other candidates (such as lipoxygenases, NADPH oxidases, and endogenous copper) were previously considered [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. MPO is an enzyme secreted by activated neutrophils; it catalyses the production of hypochlorous acid from hydrogen peroxide and chloride. The generated HOCl is responsible for the modification of LDLs into chlorinated LDLs (HOCl-LDLs) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, serum MPO levels are markers of adverse prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mox-LDLs are endowed with proinflammatory properties. Mox-LDL indeed triggers IL-8 gene expression by endothelial cells and monocytes and macrophages, respectively [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. They also interfere with EC function. The endothelial dysfunction involves expression of adhesion molecules recruiting immune cells to the endothelium and allowing them to penetrate into lesions [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among the recruited cell types are monocytes, which, once in the intima, will differentiate into macrophages, engulf atherogenic oxidized lipoproteins, and evolve into the so-called foam cells. Foam cell accumulation contributes to the formation of an atheroma core which will further evolve into a mass of necrotic cells, cholesterol, and lipid debris [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This process is considered the hallmark of early atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction also impedes EC motility and migration [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; EC motility is a fundamental aspect of angiogenesis, an essential process involved in many physiological and pathological processes [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It could also be critical in cases of endothelium desquamation associated with the presence of circulating ECs correlated to many pathologies such as vasculitis, lupus erythematosus, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, septic shock, infections (rickettsiae, CMV), or cancer [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As far as atherosclerosis is concerned, circulating ECs are associated with plaque ruptures, stroke, or myocardial infarctions [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Physical denudation of the ECs bed has been described at atheroma plaque locations and a failure to locally regenerate the endothelium is suspected to be deleterious to the endothelium function [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Also post-AMI (acute myocardial infarction) vascular reconstruction surgery and stenting procedures have been doomed to failure due to restenosis which is thought to be linked to the inability of the endothelium to regenerate and heal the denuded regions [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another phenomenon involving EC growth and associated with CVD is stent reendothelialization. Finally, most of the procedures involved in stenosis or aneurysm treatments involve catheterization associated with vascular wall denudation [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The question arises whether oxidized LDL, on top of being instrumental in atheroma plaque formation, would also interfere with the ability to heal the associated endothelium whether this damage is subsequent to atherosclerosis or not. In order to address this question, we investigated the possible effect of physiologically modified LDL on EC motility and survival as well as gene expression and signal transduction. We report that pathological concentrations of MPO-modified LDLs inhibit EC mobility and angiogenic properties and that this defect relies on miR-22 and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) increase.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Gene Knockdown and Overexpression</title><p>Clonetics HUVEC Cells (Lonza) were cultured in complete Clonetics EBM Endothelial Growth Medium (Lonza; Cat. number CC-312) at 37&#x000b0;C, 5%&#x02009;(v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> according to the provider's recommendations. Cell transfections were carried out using Gene Trans II according to the manufacturer's instructions (MobiTec; Cat. number 0102B). For miR-22 selective knockdown and inhibition, we used miRCURY LNA microRNA inhibitor [hsa-miR-22&#x02009;<sup>*</sup>] supplied by Exiqon (product number 411669-00) (sequence: AAGCTTGCCACTGAAGAAC). For quality assessment of the knockdown experiment, we used a miRCURY LNA microRNA inhibitor negative control (sequence: GTGTAACACGTCTATACGCCCA). For HO-1 overexpression, we used the TrueClone pCMV6AC-HMOX1(NM_002133.1) vector supplied by OriGene (SKU SC320297).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

Briefly, 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of EBM at room temperature was added into each well of E-plate 16. The E-plate 16 was then connected to the system and checked in the cell culture incubator for proper electrical contacts and the background impedance was measured during 24&#x02009;s. HUVECs were resuspended in EBM and adjusted to 10<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;cells/<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>L. 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of the cell suspension was added to the wells on E-plate 16 and the plate was then placed back to the incubator. Approximately 24 hours after seeding, the cells were exposed to 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of control medium or medium containing either native LDL or Mox-LDL at a final concentration of 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL. Controls received EBM medium only. Cell behavior was monitored every 20&#x02009;min by the xCELLigence system for a period of 48 hours via the incorporated sensor electrode arrays of the E-Plate 16. The electrical impedance was measured by the RTCA-integrated software of the xCELLigence system as a dimensionless parameter termed Cell Index (CI).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Tubulogenesis Assay</title><p>The Matrigel tube formation assay, or tubulogenesis assay, was performed to assess the ability of HUVECs to form endothelial cell vascular structures (or tubules) involved in vessel formation (angiogenesis). As previously described [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], individual wells were coated with 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences; Cat. number 356234) in a 24-well plate and allowed to polymerize at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hours. After polymerization, 250&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of complete EBM was added to each well and the plate was incubated for an additional hour at 37&#x000b0;C. 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> HUVECs (which were either treated or not with native LDL and Mox-LDL for 24 hours) were then resuspended in 500&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of complete EBM (Lonza; Cat. number CC-312) (&#x000b1; native LDL or Mox-LDL at a final concentration of 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/mL) and were added to each well in duplicate. After an overnight incubation, cells were inspected for tubule formation and pictures were taken from three fields of views using inversed light microscopy with the 4x objective. The tubule networks lengths were measured using the Image J program, averaged between the fields of views and duplicates, and expressed as a percentage of control untreated cells. Experiments were reproduced 3 times independently.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Tubulogenesis in Real-Time</title><p>The procedure was conducted as described above with the exception that the cells were incubated in a 37&#x000b0;C conditioned chamber of an AxioVision-Carl Zeiss microscope and the microscope was set to automatically take pictures at 10&#x02009;min intervals over a 9-hour period. The culture medium was buffered with HEPES at a 15&#x02009;mM final concentration to compensate for the CO<sub>2</sub> unavailability in our setup.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. <italic>In Vitro</italic> Wound-Healing Assay</title><p>HUVEC migration was monitored using the wound-healing assay as previously described [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

After a 24-hour incubation allowing the cells to attach and form a confluent monolayer, the cells were scraped with a conserved width using a yellow tip. After scraping, cells were washed with PBS and were incubated in EBM with or without native LDL/Mox-LDL at final concentrations of 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/mL. Scratch width was photographed at times 0 and 8 hours from three fields of views using the 20x objective with a microscopic camera system coupled to an inverted light microscope. The experiments were performed in duplicate. Using the Image J program, the wound sizes were measured by calculating the distance between the wound edges which remained cell-free at <italic>t</italic> = 8&#x02009;h, averaged between the fields of views and duplicates and expressed as a percentage of the initial wound width at <italic>t</italic> = 0&#x02009;h.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Cell Migration Assay</title><p>As previously described [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], cell migration assays were carried out using modified Boyden chambers consisting of Transwell membrane filter inserts (Greiner Bio-one; Cat. number 662631) in 24-well tissue culture plates. The translucent Transwell membranes were 6.5&#x02009;mm in diameter with a pore size of 8&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m.

Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol total RNA isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science). To profile microRNA expression in the treated and nontreated HUVECs, a two-step procedure was then performed. First, for cDNA synthesis from the miRNAs, 1000&#x02009;ng of the extracted total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (RT) using the TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and Megaplex RT primers (Human Pool A, Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions, allowing simultaneous reverse transcription of 380 mature human miRNAs.

Briefly, in order to express MPO, a recombinant plasmid that codes for prepromyeloperoxidase was constructed and named pNIV2703. This plasmid contains an MPO fragment coding for amino acid 11 in the putative signal sequence to amino acid 696. The pNIV2703 expression vector was transfected into CHO cells by electopermeabilization.

MPO-Oxidized LDL (Mox-LDL) Interferes with Cell Behavior in HUVECs</title><p>In order to monitor in real-time the influence of Mox-LDL on the dynamics of cell adhesion and proliferation in HUVECs, the xCELLigence system [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was exploited. Cells were seeded and the impedance of the EC layer was measured in real time. The impedance Cell Index (CI) progressively increased over 24 hours after seeding, due to intrinsic cell properties probably including a combination of cell adherence, morphological changes, and proliferation. After 24 hours of signal acquisition, cells reached confluence and covered up the whole surface area of the E plate wells and impedance reached a plateau. Native LDL or Mox-LDL was then added to the wells and the impedance measurements were carried on for another 24 hours. While the impedance CI remained stable in the mock-treated and native LDL-treated wells, it significantly decreased in the Mox-LDL treated wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As the impedance CI is affected by cell adhesion, proliferation, attachment, spreading, and intercellular contact, this suggested that Mox-LDL interferes with one of these cell parameters. We therefore decided to further address these EC properties in dedicated assays.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Mox-LDL Decreases Tubulogenesis in HUVECs</title><p>In order to investigate the effect of Mox-LDL on the ability of ECs to build a vascular network, an<italic> in vitro</italic> tubulogenesis assay was performed using HUVECs. ECs were initially incubated in control medium or medium supplemented with native LDL or Mox-LDL. After 24&#x02009;h, cells were switched to Matrigel coated plates overnight. As expected, control ECs formed a characteristic capillary-like network [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>, Mox-LDL partially inhibited the ability of EC to build a vascular network, whereas control native LDL had no effect. Quantification analysis indicated that the decrease of the cumulative vessel length in presence of Mox-LDL was higher than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>), demonstrating that Mox-LDL severely affected angiogenic activities of ECs. Monitoring network formation in real time during 9 hours indicated that this effect was related to an inhibition of sprout projection rather than to regression of preformed network (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Mox-LDL Inhibits Migratory Abilities of ECs<italic> In Vitro</italic>
</title><p>Because tubulogenesis is highly dependent on cell migration, we next investigated the action of Mox-LDL in an<italic> in vitro</italic> wound healing assay [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this assay, cultured HUVEC monolayers preincubated for 24 hours in mock medium, native LDL, or Mox-LDL supplemented medium were allowed to recolonize a scratched area for 8 hours. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>, the migration ability of Mox-LDL-treated ECs was decreased, an effect not seen in presence of native LDL. Cell migration was assessed by measuring the distance between the scratch edges of the cell free area at <italic>t</italic> = 8&#x02009;h and expressing it as a percentage of the initial scratch width at <italic>t</italic> = 0&#x02009;h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, while 57% and 46% of the scratch girth remained unclosed after 8 hours in mock and LDL treated cells, respectively, 80% remained unclosed in Mox-LDL treated cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Mox-LDL Inhibits ECs Directional Chemomigration</title><p>We then evaluated the effect of Mox-LDL on HUVEC chemomigration in a modified Boyden chamber assay [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. HUVECs were initially cultured in the presence or absence of native LDL or Mox-LDL for 24 hours. Cells were then harvested and seeded in the bottom of the upper chamber of the Boyden chamber in similar conditions. Directional cell migration was induced towards a VEGF gradient. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, EC migration was diminished in presence of Mox-LDL. In contrast, native LDL had no effect. Quantification analysis indicated that Mox-LDL treatment decreased cell migration by more than 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that both random and directional migratory abilities of ECs were severely affected by Mox-LDL addition.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. Mox-LDL Does Not Interfere with HUVEC Proliferation or Viability</title><p>Next, we checked whether the negative effect of Mox-LDL on HUVEC tubulogenesis and migration was due to a negative effect on cell proliferation or viability. To this aim, we incubated EC in culture medium supplemented with native LDL or Mox-LDL or control medium for 24 hours. ECs were harvested and submitted to FACS analyses, first using a combination of Ki67 antibodies and LIVE/DEAD stain to evaluate cell death and proliferation [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The proportion of apoptotic cells was also assessed by annexin V and propidium Iodide staining [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. No significant disparities regarding cell proliferation, viability, or death (apoptosis or necrosis) between any of the conditions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref>) could be detected. Statistical analyses of results coming from independent experiments confirmed that the percentage of proliferating, dead or PS positive cells, remained comparable in all conditions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(d)</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>3.6. Mox-LDL Has No Effect on Adhesion Foci</title><p>Our data pointed at an effect of Mox-LDL on HUVEC motility. Key players in this phenomenon are the structures mediating cells/ECM interaction called adhesion plaques or adhesion foci. We therefore analyzed the effect of our treatments on these adhesion complexes. IF staining of paxillin, a classical marker of adhesion foci, did not show any effect of Mox-LDL on the occurrence, size, or subcellular distribution of adhesion complexes in ECs as shown in Supplementary Figure I (see Supplementary Material available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/134635">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/134635</ext-link>). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a major player in signal transduction pathways responsible for matrix reorganization, cell-matrix adhesion, and cell migration [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated phosphorylation of FAK upon Mox-LDL treatment. Western blot analyses of HUVECs using an anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr 576) antibody did not reveal any effect of Mox-LDL on phosphorylated FAK levels (Supplementary Figure II) or localization (data not shown), thus confirming that Mox-LDL has no impact on EC adhesive properties.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>3.7.

Transcriptional Effects of Mox-LDL Treatment in HUVECs</title><p>In order to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying Mox-LDL effects and HO-1 induction, we sought to check whether a change in microRNAs (miRs) expression patterns could be correlated with the phenotypic Mox-LDL actions in HUVECs [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hence, RNA was extracted from HUVECs incubated in control or LDL and Mox-LDL supplemented medium. It was first analyzed by the TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) technique. Several miRs were identified to be differentially expressed exclusively in Mox-LDL treated HUVECs (see Supplementary Table II). TLDA results were validated by qRT-PCR conducted on each of the differentially expressed miRs using specific primers. This led to a high-confidence miR signature of miR-133a, miR-203, miR-22 overexpression (4, 2.5, and 8.5 times; resp.), and miR-672 down-regulation (3 fold) upon Mox-LDL treatment (see Supplementary Table III). In particular, miR-22 was upregulated 8.5 times in Mox-LDL treated cells as compared to control.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.9"><title>3.9. A Functional Relation between miR-22 Induction, HO-1 Expression, and Tubulogenesis Inhibition by Mox-LDL in HUVECs</title><p>As we established an effect of Mox-LDL on HUVEC motility and tubulogenesis, as well as a correlated mRNA and micoRNA signature, we assessed a causal and functional interaction between these three observations; we first screened the upregulated mRNA 3&#x02032;UTR for putative consensus sites targeted by up- or downregulated miRs.<italic> In silico</italic> analysis uncovered a miR-22 target site located between positions 276 and 299 in the HO-1 3&#x02032;UTR. In order to test a causal effect of miR-22 on HO-1 gene expression, we examined the effect of miR-22 knockdown on the expression of HO-1. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>, depletion of miR-22 prevented HO-1 expression even when the cells were treated with Mox-LDL.</p><p>In order to test a causal effect of miR-22 on tubulogenesis, we prevented miR-22 expression in Mox-LDL treated ECs and assessed their tubulogenic activities in a Matrigel assay. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>, inhibition of miR-22 specifically counteracted Mox-LDL negative effect on tubulogenesis. We next asked if the functionally connected miR-22 and HO-1 upregulations under Mox-LDL treatment could account for the negative phenotypical effect of Mox-LDL on tubulogenesis. We also verified that overexpression of HO-1 recapitulated the inhibitory effect of Mox-LDL treatment on angiogenic properties of HUVECs (Supplementary Figure IV).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Our data indicate that Mox-LDL interferes negatively with HUVEC mobility (motility, migration, and tubulogenesis)<italic> in vitro</italic> through an increase of miR-22 and HO-1 expression.</p><p>Our study must be discussed in light of previously published studies on the effects of ox-LDL on (i) cell death/apoptosis and (ii) &#x0201c;angiogenesis.&#x0201d;</p><p>Regarding cell death, in contrast to previous reports showing that ox-LDL is able to induce apoptosis and reduce the viability of vascular ECs [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we found no effect of Mox-LDL on cell proliferation and death. This discrepancy could be related to the experimental design, cell type, and oxidation protocol or ox-LDL concentration. We used an oxidizing agent and ox-LDL concentrations that are both pathophysiological which, we believe, are more closely related to an<italic> in vivo</italic> situation. In particular, copper widely used to oxidize LDL<italic> in vitro</italic> is unlikely to be available at concentrations sufficient to generate observed ox-LDL concentrations. Previously proposed actors such as lipoxygenase or NADPH oxidase have now been discarded. Although new actors could be proposed such as VPO (peroxidasin), MPO is a favourite<italic> in vivo</italic> actor: it oxidizes LDL<italic> in vitro</italic>; high serum level is a risk factor in CVD; MPO oxidized LDL is detected<italic> in vivo</italic>. We used oxidized LDL concentrations that have been previously detected<italic> in vivo</italic>. Finally, we applied a quality control procedure assessing the<italic> in-vivo</italic>-like LDL oxidation levels. These conditions could elicit specific signal transduction pathways as recently illustrated by their unique ability to trigger a pathway involving PLA2 in macrophages [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Regarding angiogenesis, we have shown for the first time that pathophysiological concentrations of Mox-LDL induce significant functional changes in human ECs. Thus in our hands, ox-LDL inhibits HUVEC<italic> in vitro</italic> tubulogenesis, motility, and migration, properties associated with<italic> in vivo</italic> angiogenesis. This has to be confronted with the few reports regarding an ox-LDL effect on angiogenesis. These data are once again contradictory, a fact which could be again related to different experimental protocols and in particular different ox-LDL concentrations. Thus, while earlier studies showed an inhibitory effect of ox-LDL and hypercholesterolemia on angiogenesis-like endothelial growth [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], some recent studies report that ox-LDL may play a proangiogenic role at low concentrations [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our observations might relate to the fact that we used oxidizing agent and concentrations which are both pathophysiological to be as close as possible to<italic> in vivo</italic> situations.</p><p>After our phenotypical analysis, we aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms interfering with EC motility. Although the simplest hypothesis would ultimately involve an interference with adhesion foci function we could not detect any effect of Mox-LDL on EC adhesives properties.</p><p>We next analyzed changes in gene expression associated with Mox-LDL treatment. Our results suggest that the observed phenotypic effect could be explained at the molecular level by HO-1 gene expression regulation by miR-22. The HO-1 enzyme is induced in response to stress stimuli such as oxidative stress and catalyzes the degradation of heme into carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and free iron. There are numerous studies linking HO-1 to angiogenesis pathways [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38a" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] suggesting both positive and negative effects. Other studies also report the antiangiogenic activity of miR-22 [<xref rid="B38b" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Two studies in particular, one performed in a colon cancer model [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and the other in a hepatocellular carcinoma model [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], linked respectively miR-22 and HO-1 upregulation to a decrease in cell migration, invasiveness, and wound healing, although independent of Mox-LDL treatment, but nevertheless in accordance with our observations performed with Mox-LDL treatment. Finally, several reports suggest how HO-1 could interfere with angiogenesis. It indeed induces the expression of pro- (CCL-2, CXCL-8) or anti- (CXCL-10) angiogenic chemokines. In this later case HO-1 overexpression induced secretion by EC of CXCL-10 which was able to inhibit EC growth [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We did not see any effect on CXCL10 expression nor on cell growth. To conclude about the role of HO-1, it is worth mentioning that none of the previous publications, although some claim that HO-1 enzymatic activity is required, investigated heme availability or CO, iron, and bilirubin production.</p><p>In order to check the causative role of the miR-22/HO-1 axis in the Mox-LDL signal transduction pathway, we inhibited miR-22 expression in ECs. MiR-22 inhibition abrogated Mox-LDL negative effect on tubulogenesis. Furthermore, miR-22 knockdown prevented HO-1 overexpression and induction by Mox-LDL. We also checked the effect of HO-1 knockdown or ectopic expression on EC angiogenic abilities. While HO-1 knockdown indicated that a minimal amount of HO-1 is mandatory for<italic> in vitro</italic> angiogenesis, its overexpression was deleterious. This supports previous indications of a complex role of HO-1, whose lower concentrations had stronger effects than higher concentrations [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and indicates that appropriate levels of HO-1 are crucial for tubulogenesis.</p><p>Our data fill gaps in the Mox-LDL signal transduction pathway. Ox-LDL have been previously reported to bind to the LOX-1 scavenger receptor and to trigger signal transduction pathways involving several kinases including JNK, pKC, ERK 1 and 2, Raf, and IP3K [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We focused on the end of this pathway: control of gene expression and phenotypic effects. Bioinformatics prediction tools pointed at a putative miR-22 target site in HO-1 mRNA and suggested a direct regulation of the latter by the first. However only rare cases of direct miR positive effects have been reported previously [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Reporter gene assays conducted in order to assess this possibility gave indeed negative results (data not shown). Putative miR-22 target sites, detected in the HO-1 promoter, suggested a possible miR transcriptional effect as previously documented [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Reporter gene assays did not support that suggestion either. Reports of miR positive effects through inhibition of a negative regulator are more frequent. In our case, this miR target remains to be identified. Yet, an alternative HO-1 control by miR-22 could happen through inhibition of nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). For example, the brain-specific miR-128 was recently shown to induce a battery of transcripts in neuronal cells through NMD repression by targeting the exon junction complex core component MLN51 and the RNA helicase UPF1 [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>We first rejected the 3 other miRs whose expression was affected by Mox-LDL due to the lack of target sites in the HO-1 3&#x02032;UTR. In the light of our negative reporter assays, they nevertheless deserve to be considered again, as they could act indirectly (for example, by interfering with the expression of a microRNA or a protein itself acting directly on HO-1 expression). This will be addressed in our future work.</p><p>The simplest model which best explains our observation is as follows. LDL modified by MPO binds to the scavenger receptor LOX-1 on ECs. This triggers an oxidative stress signaling pathway that will stimulate the binding of NRF-like transcription factor to potential consensus sequence in miR-22 promoter [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This in turn increases miR-22 expression. Mir-22 indirectly increases HO-1 expression through unidentified targets possibly by repressing NMD mechanisms in the cell. This interferes with cell motility.</p><p>However uncertainties remain in this transduction pathway. First, the nature of the molecular actor linking miR-22 and HO-l is unknown. The cell specificity of this link should be addressed as we could not perform the reporter gene assays in HUVECs. Secondly, the involvement of HO-1 enzymatic activity and the nature of its target is still hypothetic.</p><p>Our data have all been obtained<italic> in vitro</italic>. They suggest that Mox-LDL interferes with angiogenesis<italic> in vivo</italic>. Thus, high LDL concentrations in patients' serum would impair angiogenesis and hinder EC ability to cope with a damaged endothelium. These mechanisms are at play in several pathological or physiological conditions. For example, high LDL levels would impair angiogenesis-dependent tumour growth, although this seems in contradiction to reports of obesity as a risk factor for some cancers. More appropriately, while it is well known that high LDL concentrations are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases through atherosclerosis, our data suggest that they would furthermore contribute to the bad evolution of the disease through interfering with &#x0201c;reendothelialization&#x0201d; of vascular denudations, atheroma-associated wounds, stents, aneurysms, infarcts, or places of restenosis. More generally high ox-LDL levels could also negatively impact the progression of all the pathologies associated with endothelial desquamation, such as vasculitis, lupus erythematosus, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, septic shock, infections (rickettsiae, CMV), or cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>Atherosclerosis chiefly contributes to cardiovascular disease, the first cause of death worldwide, which includes cerebral vascular accidents and myocardial infarctions. Atherosclerosis is linked to the accumulation of oxidized LDL in the vascular wall, affecting its function. We show that pathophysiological concentrations of oxidized LDL impair the mobility and the angiogenic capability of endothelial cells. We identify a microRNA (a small RNA able to tune gene expression), miR-22, and the gene coding for heme oxygenase 1 whose overexpression is instrumental in this phenotypical effect. Our results suggest that lipid rich diets that enhance the LDL and ox-LDL levels not only cause atheroma plaque formation but also interfere with the endothelial wound healing process; they can therefore contribute to the progression of the disease; they can influence negatively all clinical conditions associated with endothelial desquamation. They can interfere with denudations resulting from medical protocols such as catheterization or stenting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-sec"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f1"><caption><p>We showed that Mox-LDL inhibits EC motility and tubulogenesis and tried to uncover the molecular mechanisms behind this action.
