Without treatment, CMO will resolve in only 30% of patients with non-ischaemic CRVO and less with ischaemic CRVO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) inhibitors have revolutionised the treatment of CMO secondary to CRVO, with mean gains of 3-lines (15 letters) in vision due to reduction in or resolution of CMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The optimal treatment regimen of intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF inhibitors is yet to be fully characterised.

This resulted in excellent structural and functional improvements during the loading and monthly follow up periods, however, much of the visual gains were lost when the follow up interval was increased in the second year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The GALILEO study evaluated aflibercept injections with a similar treatment regimen as COPERNICUS in the first year, but had 8-weekly follow up in the second year of the study, rather than 3-monthly. Nonetheless, the visual gains of the first year reduced in a similar fashion to COPERNICUS at the 18-month study end-point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Since then, other trials have investigated different loading periods, follow up intervals and more recently, treat-and-extend protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Treat-and-extend protocols have many potential benefits to both patient and clinician. They aim to achieve similar visual outcomes as more intensive regimens with less injections and clinics visits, as demonstrated in the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is well established that patients with prolonged duration of CMO secondary to CRVO have worse visual outcomes with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that treating patients before CMO recurs in a treat-and-extend protocol may prevent irreversible structural damage to the retinal architecture that could limit long-term visual outcomes. In this prospective, single-center cohort study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a treat-and-extend regimen with intravitreal aflibercept in patients with CMO secondary to CRVO over an 18-month period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par26">This was a prospective, single-arm, cohort study conducted at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (RVEEH), Melbourne, Australia.

Data was presented as the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD) when normally distributed or as median [interquartile range] (IQR) if not. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilks test. Descriptive statistics were performed of the baseline characteristics, visual and anatomical outcomes, treatment experience and venous closing pressure. The visual and anatomical outcomes were compared to the COPERNICUS and GALILEO trials in line graphs. To assess the predictive value of baseline characteristics on visual outcomes, a linear regression was applied. The dependent variable was change in ETDRS letters at 18&#x02009;months from baseline. The independent variables were the measured baseline characteristics. For the regression analysis, baseline CMT was divided by 10. The resulting odds ratios were per 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;m difference in baseline CMT. The difference in visual and anatomical outcomes at 18&#x02009;months between patients that required a short or long interval between injections and less or more injections was assessed. For these analyses, patients were stratified into groups of less than the median, or, the median or more injection interval and number of injections. The homogeneity of variances between two groups was assessed using Levene&#x02019;s test. Differences in continuous variables were compared using a student&#x02019;s t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test for normally and not normally distributed data, respectively. Differences in proportions were analysed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.

Three patients were lost to follow up before the 12-month visit. Two of these withdrew because of coexistent medical conditions requiring hospitalisation and resultant difficulty in attending follow up appointments. One withdrew due to perceived lack of efficacy of treatment despite having improved from 60 ETDRS letters read at baseline (20/63) to 71 (20/40) at the last treatment visit (week 28). Consequently, all twenty (100%) patients completed the 6&#x02009;month visit but only 17 (85%) patients completed the 12 and 18&#x02009;month follow-ups, and their data were used for statistical analyses at those time points. One patient had laser photocoagulation and one had cataract surgery prior to study entry. The baseline characteristics of this cohort are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The median baseline vision was 55.0 [36.8 to 64.8] ETDRS letters and the mean baseline CMT was 807&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;238&#x02009;&#x003bc;m. The mean age at study entry was 61.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.3&#x02009;years and 16 of 20 (80%) patients were male. The youngest patient was 23&#x02009;years old, the next youngest was 46&#x02009;years old. Due to the young age at presentation, the 23-year-old patient was referred to our physicians for review. Other than hypertension, no other systemic condition associated with CRVO was found. Investigations were performed for inflammatory, infectious and thrombophilic conditions. There was no difference in the measured baseline characteristics between those who completed follow up and those that did not.

Treating when the macula is dry may prevent long-term vision loss due to cumulative damage to photoreceptors and outer retinal structures that occurs when oedema is present, a pre-requisite for re-treatment in PRN protocols. The results of the pivotal trials are consistent with this: firstly, the sham-treated patients who were switched to anti-VEGF after 6&#x02009;months in CRUISE, COPERNICUS and GALILEO did not achieve the same visual outcomes as those who were initially treated with anti-VEGF; and, secondly the gains achieved in these studies during the first 12&#x02009;months were not maintained in the second year when the treatment protocols switched from monthly to PRN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to better visual outcomes, the number of clinic visits should be less in treat-and-extend protocols. In our study the median number of visits was 11.0 over 18&#x02009;months, which would compare to 14 or 15 in the COPERNICUS study that had 3-monthly visits in the second year and 16 or 17 in the GALILEO study that had 8-weekly visits in the second year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">This study provides useful clinical information for patients and clinicians embarking on a treat-and-extend protocol for CMO secondary to CRVO, which, to date, has not been thoroughly investigated. Important findings were that almost one in four patients met the criteria to stop treatment at or before 18&#x02009;months. Further, after 12&#x02009;months of treatment, it is worthwhile attempting a first extension if clinical activity persists despite 4-weekly treatments or if clinical activity recurred during the first attempt to extend the interval between treatments. In almost 70% of these patients in our study, it was possible to increase the interval between injections, by an average of 2&#x02009;weeks. Also, the amount of treatment that is required does not to appear to impact clinical outcomes. We found that there was no significant difference in visual or anatomical outcomes between those requiring less than the median, and the median or more, injections or interval between injections. This finding is in keeping with the theory that minimising the duration of oedema results in better visual outcomes for patients.</p><p id="Par50">This study was novel in its standardised assessment of venous closing pressure at all study visits. Absolute and change in CVP was not linked to change in clinical activity; its absence and, therefore, the extension in the interval between injections, or its recurrence. This is in contrast to a previous report that found a prognostic significance of CVP in patients with CRVO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but is in keeping with our clinical experience of this being a poor marker for treatment outcomes and suggests that raised hydrostatic pressure is not the only driver for recurrent in CMO.</p><p id="Par51">In comparison to other treat and extend studies in treating CMO as a result of CRVO, the Study of Comparative Treatments for Retinal Vein Occlusion 2 study randomised patients who responded well to 6, 4-weekly injections of aflibercept to a PRN or treat-and-extend protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our study differs from this in that all patients received a treat-and-extend protocol and we used a loading dose regimen consisting of three, 4-weekly injections. Casselholm de Salles et al. also recently published a prospective study comparing ranibizumab to aflibercept using a treat-and-extend protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It varies from ours in that recurrence was defined as CMO on OCT and no further attempt to extend the interval between injections was permitted after a recurrence of fluid. The aflibercept arm in their study had very similar visual outcomes (mean improvement in visual acuity of 22.4 (15.3&#x02013;29.4) at 18&#x02009;months to ours and required the same number of injections (10.9). The similarity in outcomes adds to the validity of the results of both studies, performed in different countries with different patient populations. This is particularly pertinent given the relatively small numbers in each study.</p><p id="Par52">The weaknesses of this study are its small numbers and the lack of internal validation as a result of its single-arm design. Accordingly, caution should be used when comparing our results to those of the pivotal clinical trials and in interpreting our safety data. Its strengths are its prospective design and single-center nature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">In conclusion, our study suggests that a treat-and-extend protocol leads to similar visual results compared to the pivotal, COPERNICUS and GALILEO trials and avoided the visual decline that occurred during the second year of these trials. This was achieved with a similar number of injections, but less clinic visits. Thus treat-and-extend protocols for CMO secondary to CRVO, which are less taxing on patients and healthcare services, appear to be at least equivalent to monthly and then PRN regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
