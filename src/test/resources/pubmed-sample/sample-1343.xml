And hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the principal cell source of ECM. NR4A2 (Nurr1) is a member of orphan nuclear receptor NR4A family and acts as transcription factor. It participates in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that NR4A2 expression in fibrotic liver reduced significantly compared with normal liver and NR4A2 knockout in HSCs promoted ECM production. In the present study we explored the role of NR4A2 on liver fibrosis. Studies in cultured HSCs demonstrated that NR4A2 over-expression suppressed the activation of HSCs, such as ECM production and invasion ability.

An increase in the amount of the ECM is the typical feature of all forms of fibrosis. During liver fibrogenesis there is significant increase in the content of collagens, particularly of fibril-forming types I and III<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The reiterated liver tissue damage due to infective (mostly hepatitis B and C viruses), toxic induced, metabolic and autoimmune can last for several decades and leads to cirrhosis, the end consequence of hepatic fibrosis, which has high mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been closely related to liver fibrogenesis through which epithelial cells contribute to the replacement of dead or damaged hepatic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The ECM is mostly produced by myofibroblasts. HSCs (hepatic stellate cells) are the key myofibroblast population in hepatic fibrosis. It was reported that 94% to 96% of myofibroblasts were derived from HSCs in liver fibrotic models and the contribution of HSCs to the hepatic myofibroblast pool in liver fibrosis ranged from 82% to 89%&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>HSCs reside in the space of Disse which constitute 5&#x02013;15% of all hepatic cells and represent a vital fibrogenic cell population in liver.

Targeting both specific functions of myofibroblast (collagen production) and myofibroblast themselves might prove therapeutically effective. HSCs are not only a key fibrogenic cell population in the liver but also amenable to cell-specific delivery approaches which makes them an attractive candidates for direct anti-fibrotic therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>NR4A2 (also called Nurr1) is a member of orphan nuclear receptor NR4A family and acts as transcription factor. The NR4A subfamily members are widely distributed in cells regulating differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis and involved in multiple diseases, for example vascular sclerosis, cancer and metabolic syndrome. Our previous study demonstrated NR4A2 knockdown could promote HSCs proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In this study we explored the effect of AdNR4A2, adenovirus carrying NR4A2 gene, on activated HSCs or liver fibrosis and clarified its mechanism. Our data showed that NR4A2 gene over-expression by adenovirus-mediated significantly suppressed the activated HSCs and attenuated dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) reduced hepatic fibrosis. These results suggest that NR4A2 could be a promising target gene for anti-fibrotic therapy and exploiting agents that increases NR4A2 expression would be very meaningful.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>AdNR4A2 decreases the expression of ECM gene in HSCs</title><p>In liver fibrosis, activated HSCs produced most ECM and the level of &#x003b1; smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA). a typical marker for liver fibrosis elevates significantly.</p><p>To investigate the effect of NR4A2 on ECM production AdNR4A2 and its negative control AdNC were generated. We verified the MOI (Multiplicity of Infection) of AdNR4A2 and AdNC in HSCs and the preferred MOI was 40.

The rats were sacrificed and hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin, Sirius red and Masson&#x02019;s trichrome staining. The rats in AdNC (AdNC and DMN treated together) group and model (DMN treated only) group exhibited evident and uniform liver fibrosis after 4 weeks of repeated DMN injection. And most rats in the two groups showed stage 3 or 4 liver fibrosis. The severity of the liver fibrosis was markedly milder in the AdNR4A2 (AdNR4A2 and DMN treated together) group than that in AdNC group or model groups with most indicating stage 2 liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>Fibrosis score for the Masson&#x02019;s trichrome staining suggested that fibrosis area increased significantly in AdNC group or model group after hepatic fibrosis was induced.

Accordance with the histological grading the liver hydroxyproline content of the AdR4A2 group was significantly lower than that of AdNC group or model group, and there was no significant difference between AdNC group and model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p><p>RT-PCR analysis for mRNA of rat liver tissue indicated that &#x003b1;-SMA level increased obviously and NR4A2 level reduced sharply in model group or AdNC group than in normal group. The NR4A2 level elevated and&#x003b1;-SMA level reduced significantly in AdNR4A2 group compared with AdNC group or model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>).</p><p>We detected the NR4A2 and &#x003b1;-SMA protein expression in liver tissue.

And the staining of NR4A2 increased significantly in AdNR4A2 group compared with AdNC group or model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining results revealed decreased staining of NR4A2 around portal tract and fibrotic septa after DMN injection, which was accompanied by increased &#x003b1;-SMA expression, implying that AdNR4A2 is involved in the inactivation of hepatic stellate cells. In consequence increased staining of NR4A2 accompanied by decreased expression of &#x003b1;-SMA was found in AdNR4A2 group than in AdNC group or model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The staining of NR4A2 by double &#x02013;label immunofluorescence in AdNR4A2 group was more intense than that in model group or AdNC group. There was no significant difference between model group and AdNC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).

And the number of apoptotic cells elevated significantly after AdNR4A2 treatment than in AdNC group or model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). These data implied that AdNR4A2 therapy may lead to the cell apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Liver fibrosis is the result of sustained hepatic inflammation and characterized with large amount of ECM in which HSCs play an important role. Quiet HSCs can be activated by a variety of insults. Activated HSCs secrete cytokines such as TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, COX2 and TLR4. Among them TGF-&#x003b2; is a central regulator of mesenchymal repair responses and orchestrates the release of extracellular matrix during tissue repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Both reverting activated HSCs to quiet state or apoptosis and inhibiting profibrogenic gene expression of HSCs are effective for anti-fibrotic therapy. Recently it was demonstrated that liver fibrosis is reversible in either human being or animal model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Accumulated evidence suggested nuclear receptors regulate key steps in activation of HSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR-&#x003b3;) inhibits profibrogenic genes expression in quiescent HSCs. Treatment with PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists restrains HSCs from activation and suppresses collagen production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Our previous study indicated that NR4A2 level decreased significantly in fibrotic liver or activated HSCs and knockout of NR4A2 led to the increase of &#x003b1;-SMA and collagen I&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our current study showed that NR4A2 gene over-expression resulted in the reduction of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-SMA in HSC-T6 cells. In addition, we obtained the same results in primary hepatic stellate cells. These cells could be spontaneously stimulated after isolation in which quiet HSCs transform into activated HSCs which resembles the activation process <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; is a master regulator of mesenchymal responses in physiological and pathological conditions and induces the transcription of type I and III collagen in HSCs, promoting liver fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Our previous study showed when HSCs were transiently stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2; the NR4A2 expression increased. Yet persistent stimulation led to reduced NR4A2 level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We further demonstrated that NR4A2 over-expression resulted in decreased levels of TGF-&#x003b2;, Col I and Col III in HSCs. It implied that NR4A2 is a key checkpoint to control TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and chronically activated TGF-&#x003b2; signaling escapes the regulatory effects of NR4A2 by disrupting the NR4A2 feedback loop. Adenovirus mediated NR4A2 enhancement could re-activate an endogenous regulatory loop. When TGF-&#x003b2; expression was inhibited the levels of Col I and Col III reduced in the end. But the detailed mechanism needs to explore in future study.</p><p>NR4A2 is involved in regulating cell cycle and cell apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In our study, AdNR4A2 treatment led to cell cycle arrest such as increased percentage of cells in G1 phase and reduced percentage of cells in G2 phase as well as significant increase of cell apoptosis rate. It implied that NR4A2 enhancement could revert activated HSCs to quiet state via arresting cell cycle and promote cell apoptosis directly. This is consistent with documents that NR4As induces cell death apart from as transcription factor regulating target gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>NR4A2 can relocate from nucleus to mitochondria and bind to Bcl-2 which triggers cytochrome C release and results in cell apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We applied adenovirus carrying NR4A2 to infect HSCs and found that the rate of NR4A2 nuclear translocation increased significantly. To a certain degree our study consistent with previous reports, but the mechanism and details require further exploration.</p><p>During liver fibrosis activated HSCs can migrate vigorously which is a distinctive property of activated HSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Our study showed that NR4A2 enhancement can weaken its migration and invasion ability. It illustrated that NR4A2 down-regulate the function of HSCs from another aspect.</p><p>MAPK pathway is involved in the activation of HSCs and we previously found that knockdown of NR4A2 led to decrease of phosphorylation of MAPK. The Western blotting analysis showed reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P38 and JNK when NR4A2 was knocked down in HSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. And on the contrary we observed NR4A2 gene over-expression in HSCs caused the increase of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. Glass <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that nuclear receptors were involved in regulation of signaling pathways and some nuclear receptors could inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways directly in macrophages and T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Our results are similar with Glass <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s. And it implied NRA42 may suppress the activation of HSCs via phosphorylation of MAPK pathway.</p><p>In addition we validated AdNR4A2 effect in liver fibrosis <italic>in vivo.</italic> Histological examination results showed AdNR4A2 therapy reverted fibrotic degree to stage 2 from stage 3 and decreased the collage content. Fibrosis score analysis indicated that the fibrotic area reduced sharply after AdNR4A2 treatment. We also observed that the NR4A2 protein and mRNA level reduced obviously and &#x003b1;-SMA levels elevated significantly when DMN was applied to induce liver fibrosis in rats. Meanwhile AdNR4A2 therapy gave rise to the increase of NR4A2 protein and mRNA level and the reduction of &#x003b1;-SMA protein and mRNA level. Taken together, AdNR4A2 treatment ameliorated liver fibrosis significantly <italic>in vivo</italic>. At the same time we noticed high expression of NR4A2 in hepatocytes in liver tissue. It is not contradictory as other cells express NR4A2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taura <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that hepatocytes are not involved in liver fibrogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. There were similar reports on NR4A member. Yin <italic>et al</italic>. discovered that the expression of NA4A1, NR4A2 and NR4A3 in leiomyoma was remarkably lower than that in myometrium and the reductions in NA4A2 and NR4A3 were significantly higher than NR4A1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Our investigation is consistent with Yin <italic>et al</italic>. that NR4A2 level in fibrotic liver is lower compared with normal liver tissue. Leuprolide acetate is usually applied for the treatment of uterine fibroid. Yin <italic>et al</italic>. further found that Leuprolide acetate could suppress uterine fibrosis lesion via increasing NR4A2 level. In our study, we raised NR4A2 level through AdNR4A2 treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> and NR4A2 gene over-expression suppressed liver fibrosis in the end. It is evident that Yin <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02019;s report strongly supports our view.</p><p>NR4A2 involved in regulating cell cycle and cell apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.

NR4A2 may be an ideal gene target for anti-fibrotic therapy and developing some agents increasing NR4A2 expression is very valuable for future clinical application.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (SLAC, Shanghai, China), weighing approximately 250&#x02013;270&#x02009;g were maintained in a 12-hour dark/12-hour light cycle.
