Here we use a simple, sorghum system with abundant sampling to show that stochastic forces (drift or stochastic dispersal) act on fungal community assembly in leaves and roots early in host development and when sorghum is drought stressed, conditions when mycobiomes are small. Unexpectedly, we find no signal for stochasticity when drought stress is relieved, likely due to renewed selection by the host. In our experimental system, the&#x000a0;host compartment exerts the strongest effects on mycobiome assembly, followed by the timing of plant development and lastly by plant genotype.

In contrast, studies of the total communities of fungi associated with plants are few and far fewer than those of total communities of bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, despite the fact that, in terrestrial environments, fungi account for more biomass than bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Here we tackle this gap in knowledge of fungal communities associated with plants by adding the fungal mycobiome to studies of the bacterial microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We use an approach that accounts for the variation in plant compartment (leaf, root, rhizosphere and soil), plant development (from seedling emergence to grain maturation), physical environment (irrigation and drought), and host genotype (drought response to either retain or suppress photosynthesis) as summarized in Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>. We chose drought as the key environmental variable for our study because it will be a defining feature of this century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and will not only directly affect plants and their fungal communities, but also indirectly affect plants through changes in the fungal community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Positive, indirect effects of fungal communities on plants could best be harnessed by modern agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, if the mechanisms of community assembly were better understood.</p><p id="Par4">The assembly of communities rests on the activity of the four processes that influence constituent species: selection, drift, diversification, and dispersal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Selection is wholly deterministic and drift is wholly stochastic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but both dispersal and diversification have stochastic and deterministic components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Of the four processes, drift, the stochastic extinction caused by random species abundance fluctuation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, is the most difficult to demonstrate because one must first rule out the other three processes, two of which have stochastic components, although one of these&#x02014;the evolutionary process of diversification&#x02014;can reasonably be ignored for fungi over a period as short as a season.</p><p id="Par5">Ecological drift has been estimated in ecological model fitting as the &#x02018;unexplained&#x02019; compositional variation, or has been estimated from empirical data as the dispersion of beta diversity (an approach also termed compositional variance)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, neither of these methods of estimation necessarily represent the consequences of ecological drift due to possible undermeasurement of the processes of selection, dispersal and diversification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Drift is thought to most strongly influence community assembly when (i) communities are small or when (ii) they have recently been released from selection imposed by a stress such as drought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; However, due to the difficulty of detecting drift, even in these two situations its demonstration in nature remains rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Adding our study to those already in existence raises the question of universal features of mycobiome assembly and temporal change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, in particular, are the underlying ecological dynamics of microbiomes universal across all communities or unique to individual communities? To address this point, we employed the recently developed, dissimilarity-overlap curve (DOC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The DOC approach has been applied to recent studies of human-associated bacterial microbiomes, finding universal ecological dynamics across all communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although many attempts have been made to assess the universality of microbial community assembly, assessment of universality by the DOC method has been applied to just two types of fungal mycobiomes, both of which are arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities. These studies found both universal and unique ecological dynamics depending on ecosystem type (natural v. agricultural) and phosphorus availability (low v. high)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">To thoroughly address the mechanism of community assembly, we combined a simplified environment with one crop species, sorghum [<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.)

To test these hypotheses, we characterized fungal communities associated with sorghum plants growing in the field from seedling emergence to plant senescence under conditions of regular irrigation and also when stress imposed by pre-flowering drought was relieved by resuming irrigation.</p><p id="Par9">Here, we present results that support, as hypothesized (H<sub>1</sub>), a significant role for drift early in fungal community assembly by observing a negative correlation between the strength of stochasticity on one hand and community size on the other, and note that we cannot rule out some role for the stochastic aspect of colonization. Conversely, our hypothesis, H<sub>2</sub>, that release from pre-flowering drought stress would enhance the importance of stochasticity was falsified, likely due to the strong selection exerted by the plant host in the sorghum system. Moreover, where DOC analysis shows a reduced dissimilarity among fungal communities as the fraction of shared taxa increases and where this reduced dissimilarity is supported by the bulk of all possible pairwise comparisons, we find that the underlying ecological dynamics are largely universal across mycobiomes of the different sorghum compartments and also universal across functional guilds of fungi, which include diffusion-feeding yeasts as well as filamentous plant pathogens, AM fungi, and saprotrophs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sorghum mycobiome structure</title><p id="Par10">First, we characterized overall fungal communities in an agricultural field of sorghum from samples taken before sorghum seed was sown and over the ensuing seventeen-week period from seedling emergence to grain maturation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In roots the turnover of compositional variance is more predictable than in leaves and turns over until the 12th week followed by stability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). In contrast to leaves and roots, the situation in rhizosphere and soil is different with little turnover from weeks 1 through 7 or 9, and again from weeks 13 through 17, the two periods of relative stability bridged by one of turnover (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">We also found evidence for turnover using a second analytical approach, threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), which is based on increases (z+) or decreases (z&#x02212;) in the abundance of indicator fungal OTUs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. With the leaf mycobiome, our results showed that indicator fungal OTUs showed both z+ and z&#x02212; beginning in the 7th to 8th weeks which largely ceased by the 9th week (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>).

Thus, should we detect stochasticity, it could be attributed to drift or stochastic dispersal in the period of initial colonization.

These methods compare the matrix of dissimilarities calculated for observed communities to those calculated from communities randomly assembled by sampling, with replacement, from the pool of all observed taxa. The proportion of the matrix of dissimilarity calculated from observed data with respect to the distribution of those calculated from multiple rounds of resampling determines the probability that the null hypothesis of stochasticity can be falsified.

In light of our test of H<sub>1</sub>, which was consistent with small populations promoting stochasticity, we also considered the possibility that drought might reduce population size and allow stochasticity to be important before release from drought as well as after.</p><p id="Par27">Contrary to expectations, the hypothesis (H<sub>2</sub>) that release from pre-flowering drought would favor stochasticity was not supported because stochasticity, as indicated when |&#x003b2;NTI|&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2 and |RCI|&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.95, did not increase when drought was lifted at week 9 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24</xref>). However, the prediction that stochasticity would be favored under pre-flowering drought was supported in leaves where stochasticity as judged by |&#x003b2;NTI|&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2 and |RCI|&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.95 was generally higher under pre-flowering drought as compared to control plots, with the strongest difference just before and shortly after drought was lifted at weeks 8&#x02013;9 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24</xref>). Because fungal community size was smaller under pre-flowering drought than irrigated controls (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>), these results are consistent with the results of the test of our first hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>), that ecological drift is favored when community size is small. Our rejected hypothesis, H<sub>2</sub>, was based on the thought that drought would be a strong, deterministic factor in fungal community assembly, however our results show that plant compartment (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;42.1%) and development (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.7%) exert much stronger effects on fungal communities than drought (<italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.6%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Given the dominant effect of plant compartment and development, our results can be explained by pre-flowering drought lessening the plant effect and, thereby, leading to smaller fungal populations and rising stochasticity. Similarly, drought relief would restore the plant-driven selection to pre-drought levels, obscuring any stochasticity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24</xref>). In line with these explanations, pre-flowering drought also delayed the development of sorghum in terms of both flowering time and biomass accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, as well as delaying dynamics of leaf fungal community size and abundance of individual fungal species, principally yeasts (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">25</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Our test of H<sub>2</sub> necessarily focused on pre-flowering drought because its stress could be relieved, unlike that of post-flowering drought. To compare the effects of pre- and post-flowering drought on fungal community composition over time, we turned to Random Forest (RF) models. Given that the key difference was most likely to be temporal, we needed to identify the most important age-discriminant fungal OTUs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">26</xref>) to use them to develop a more accurate sparse RF model, i.e., the trained model. To identify the most important age-discriminant fungal OTUs and use them to develop a trained model, we used a random subset of 50% control samples to construct a full RF model that treated sampling age as the response variable and all fungal OTUs as independent variables. Subsequently, the trained model was used to predict the ages of both drought samples and a second subset of 50% control samples, and the discrepancy between predicted ages of control and drought samples was then used to assess the extent of the drought effect. For fungi, similar effects of pre- and post- flowering drought were seen in all four compartments (leaf, root, rhizosphere, and soil) because the discrepancies between sampling ages and the predicted ages for pre-flowering drought communities were not larger than that predicted for post-flowering drought (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Neither was a stronger effect of pre- than post-flowering drought seen by the results of permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Our fungal results differ from those of bacterial microbiomes characterized from the same DNA samples used for our study, which showed that pre-flowering drought exerted a stronger effect on bacterial community composition than that post-flowering drought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Drought responses of sorghum mycobiome.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Pre-flowering drought effect on OTU abundance and fungal community composition.

We firstly assessed universality using pairwise comparisons of all 1026 different fungal communities and then, again, as their several, component guilds, i.e., saprotrophs, plant pathogens, endophytes and yeasts, as well as just the AM fungal communities. In each pairwise comparison, dissimilarity is calculated for just the shared OTUs, those that overlap between the two communities. These dissimilarities are then plotted against the fraction of taxa that overlap to create a DOC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Where the DOC dips as the overlap grows, universality is supported and the level of support is determined by the fraction of pairwise comparisons found where the DOC slope is negative (termed the fraction negative slope, Fns).</p><p id="Par31">For our sorghum mycobiomes, the DOCs had significant negative slopes with Fns of 63.3% for the total fungal community comparisons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), 36.1% for endophytic community comparisons, 91.0% for plant pathogenic fungal community comparisons, 44.4% for yeast community comparisons, 89.2% for saprotrophic fungal community comparisons, and 75.3% for the AM fungal community comparisons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d&#x02013;h</xref>). The initiation of negative slope in each case represents the median of initiation of negative slopes calculated from DOCs of 1000 bootstrapped data sets. Thus, the results with sorghum mycobiomes and AM fungi in an agricultural field are similar to each other and to those reported for human-associated, bacterial microbiomes (Fns&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23*&#x02013;0.99*)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and partially similar to those reported for AM fungi in natural and agricultural fields (Fns&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28*&#x02013;0.94*)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

This stochasticity, negatively correlated with fungal community size, was likely caused by ecological drift, but we cannot rule out a contribution by the initial, stochastic aspects of dispersal, i.e., stochastic colonization. Our likely detection of ecological drift in sorghum mycobiome almost certainly rests on our ability to capture and detect small fungal communities in early leaves and roots by weekly sampling beginning with seedling emergence, the choice of an extremely simple agricultural system with one species of plant and mechanical homogenization of soil, and the recent development of statistical methods that allow us to retrieve the stochastic component of compositional variance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Our likely detection of drift in a very simple system raises the possibility that drift is also important in community assembly in truly natural systems. However, in these systems, which are complex, detection of drift would be far more difficult. The action of drift and stochastic colonization early in the development of leaves and roots, when selection and competition are relatively weak, may provide a temporal window to artificially introduce beneficial microbes and suppress harmful ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Later in the growth period, the sorghum mycobiome and its component functional guilds, e.g., plant pathogens, yeasts, AM fungi, and saprotrophs, are largely shaped by homogenous selection exerted by host over temporal, spatial and genetical dimensions, as well as by drought at pre- or post-flowering stages. At critical times in the growth cycle, such as drought, the detection of flowering-dependent responses of fungal pathogens in root and rhizosphere might be useful in agricultural management. Our detection of a plant genotype effect on fungal pathogens could also be useful in plant breeding. The different temporal behaviors of fungal communities found with leaves, roots and the rhizosphere highlight the underappreciated diversity of ecological patterns in temporal community assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Our results also show that the fungal mycobiome is different from the bacterial microbiome in patterns of temporal structure, drought response and heritability at different compartments, despite the finding of universal underlying ecological dynamics. As noted at the outset, the number of studies of total bacterial communities far exceeds those of total fungi.

Indicator species for selected sampling times were identified and their threshold values were calculated using threshold indicator species analyses (TITAN) in the TITAN2 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup> in R. Manhattan plots were constructed in the ggplot2 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup> in R to visualize the P-values for the pairwise comparison of fungal OTUs between cultivar BTx642 and cultivar RTx430, and between control and either pre- or post- flowering drought.

Therefore, where possible, we use both count and compositional methods to both permit comparisons with prior studies and to analyze the data as compositional. For the count approach (dataset 1), we rarefied the number of fungal sequences per sample to 362 (the smallest read number among all the 1026 samples) using the rrarefy command in package vegan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>. Detail about the compositional method (dataset 2) can be found at our previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

PERM ANOVA was carried out to assess the effect of compartment (leaf, soil, rhizosphere or root), time period (weeks 1&#x02013;17), cultivar (BTx642, RTx430) and drought treatment (control, pre-flowering drought, or post-flowering drought) on the fungal community variation either detected by Bray&#x02013;Curtis dissimilarities or Aitchison distances using the adonis command in vegan package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup> in R. To visualize the variations in fungal community compositions, the Bray&#x02013;Curtis dissimilarity was subjected to principal coordinate analysis using the pcoa command in the Ape package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>, and the Aitchison distance was subjected to principal component analysis in base package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup> in R.

Mantel tests were carried out to explore the correlations between geographic, temporal and community composition distance matrices in the vegan package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup> in R. To remove the effect of richness variation on fungal community composition, the Simpson metric of community dissimilarity was calculated based on presence/absence data using the beta.pair command in the betapart package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup> in R, and then ordinated by the principal coordinate analysis in the Ape package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup> in R.

The DOC emerges by plotting, for each possible pair of communities, the dissimilarity on the <italic>y</italic> axis (root Jensen&#x02013;Shannon divergence as calculated from only the OTUs shared by the two communities) against the fraction of taxa that overlap on the x axis. Where the DOC dips as the overlap grows, universality is supported and the level of support is proportional to the fraction of pairwise comparisons under the graph where the DOC slope is negative (termed the fraction negative slope, Fns). For the smoothed curve of a given DOC, the initiation of negative slope represents the median of initiation of negative slopes calculated from DOCs of 1000 bootstrapped data sets.
