Conventionally, CAP was directly applied to irradiate cancer cells or tumor tissue. Over past three years, the CAP irradiated media was also found to kill cancer cells as effectively as the direct CAP treatment. As a novel strategy, using the CAP stimulated (CAPs) media has become a promising anti-cancer tool. In this study, we demonstrated several principles to optimize the anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media on glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells. Specifically, using larger wells on a multi-well plate, smaller gaps between the plasma source and the media, and smaller media volume enabled us to obtain a stronger anti-cancer CAPs media composition without increasing the treatment time. Furthermore, cysteine was the main target of effective reactive species in the CAPs media. Glioblastoma cells were more resistant to the CAPs media than breast cancer cells. Glioblastoma cells consumed the effective reactive species faster than breast cancer cells did. In contrast to nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide was more likely to be the effective reactive species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>During the past decade, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), a near room temperature plasma mainly composed of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, has been extensively investigated for its promising application in anti-cancer therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. So far, CAP has shown a significant anti-cancer capacity over a wide range of cancer cell lines, including carcinomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, melanomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, neuroectodermal malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and hematopoietic malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In addition, the CAP also strongly resists tumor growth in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Several general conclusions about the anti-cancer mechanism of CAP have been acknowledged. First, the rise of intracellular ROS always occurs in cancer cells upon CAP treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, which causes a noticeable damage on the antioxidant system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and subsequently DNA double strands break (DSB) to a fatal degree<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Second, serious DNA damage and other effect of CAP on cancer cells result in the cell cycle arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, apoptosis or necrosis with a dose-dependent pattern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Third, among diverse reactive species generated in CAP, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO are proposed to be key molecules to kill cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Fourth, untransformed normal cells always show stronger resistance to CAP than cancer cells do<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Such killing preference on cancer cells is always accompanied with the distinct ROS levels and DSB among cancer cells and normal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Conventionally, the CAP is directly used to irradiate cancer cells or tissue. Over past three years, the CAP irradiated media was also found to kill cancer cells as effectively as the direct CAP treatment did<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In contrast to the direct CAP treatment, the CAPs media has advantages. The CAPs media can be stored in the refrigerator and maintain its anti-cancer capacity for at least 7 days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Thus, the CAPs media might be a good fit for the condition where a CAP device is not available. Moreover the CAPs media can be injected into tissues and effectively prevent tumor growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. These tissues may not be easily penetrated by the CAP jet, which only causes the cell death in the upper 3&#x02013;5 cell layers of the CAP touched tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To date, the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media has been researched less than the direct CAP treatment. Therefore, basic principles to guide its application remain elusive.</p><p>In this study, four factors have been found to be capable of optimizing the anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media on glioblastoma cells (U87), breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7): the treatment time, the well size, the gap between plasma source and liquid, and the volume of media,. Glioblastoma is the most lethal form of brain cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Due to its strong resistance to conventional therapy, the median survival time of patients is only 15 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. CAP has shown promising anti-cancer capacity on glioblastoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Breast cancer is the most common women malignancy in United States<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cells and estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells are highly invasive and poorly invasive breast cancer cells, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The vulnerability of these three cell lines to the CAPs media was compared. In addition, we investigated which amino acids reacted most significantly with the effective reactive species by using the amino acids rich DMEM and the cell probes we invented. It was determined that, compared with NO, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was more likely to be main effective reactive species. Because the diffusion speed of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> across the cellular membrane might directly affect the intracellular ROS level, the consumption speeds of effective reactive species and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by cancer cells were studied. Ultimately, the anti-cancer effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rich DMEM was investigated to explore whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was the only effective reactive species. All detailed protocols were illustrated in Methods. This study built principles to guide the application of the CAPs media and provided insight to understanding the anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>CAP device and general research strategy</title><p>The CAP device was a typical cold plasma jet generator using helium as the carrying gas, which has been used in the study about the CAP effect on the cell surface integrins expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and the response of glioblastoma cells upon the CAP treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, CAP was generated between central electrode and ring electrode and flowed out of the quartz tube via the helium gas. A flow meter controlled the helium flow at a rate of 4.7&#x02009;L/min. The input voltage of DC power was 11.5&#x02009;V. The output voltage was 3.16&#x02009;kV. The power supply was about 5&#x02009;W.</p><p>The general research strategy is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>. A plasma jet vertically irradiated the media in the wells in a 6-well plate. After treatment, the CAPs media was transferred to culture cancer cells, which had been seeded in a 96-well plate. Before this step, the initial media which had been used to culture cancer cells overnight was discarded. Then, cancer cells were cultured in the incubator under the standard conditions (a 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> and humidified environment) for 72&#x02009;hours. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), a colorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich) was harnessed to qualify the cell viability.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The reactive species accumulate in the CAPs media with a dose-dependent and liquid surface-dependent pattern</title><p>Among dozens of species, NO in RNS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in ROS are thought to play key roles in killing cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In addition, hydroxyl free radicals (.OH) in CAP are also proposed to kill cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. To date, most of these conclusions are based on the research for the direct CAP treatment on cancer cells. The understanding on the RNS and ROS accumulation in the CAPs media is far from clear. In this study, we first studied the generation of NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAPs complete media (90% DMEM&#x02009;+&#x02009;10% FBS) via Griess Reagent System (Promega) and Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.</p><p>Next, we harnessed methylene blue (Fisher) to qualify the generation of .OH. In contrast to terephthalic acid, which has also been used to qualify the .OH generation after plasma treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, methylene blue (MB) is a cheaper and more convenient probe. MB strongly reacts with .OH in the aqueous solution and changes its color from blue into colorless, which can be detected by spectrophotometer at 664&#x02009;nm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The atmospheric plasma jet is a proven MB decomposition tool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. We proved that MB was just sensitive to the species with a short half-life (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Because MB is strongly absorbed by the proteins in the complete media, we investigated the generation of .OH in the CAPs deionized water in this study.</p><p>Reactive species accumulate in the CAPs media with different patterns. To better illustrate these patterns, all data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> have been normalized to be the relative values via dividing the data from experimental group by the data from corresponding control group. RNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) in the CAPs media both increase as the treatment time increases. Because MB will be consumed after the reaction with .OH, corresponding relative absorbance of the CAPs MB solution should be less than 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, noticeable .OH generation was not observed even the treatment time was extended to 2&#x02009;min. We performed the same experiment in the MB solution with a larger volume (2&#x02009;mL) and found that the generation of .OH was proportional to the plasma treatment time again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This volume-dependent pattern may be due to the interaction between plasma jet and solution. During the CAP treatment, the liquid below the plasma jet would be extruded, pushing the solution to the perimeter of well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a</xref>). When the volume of liquid was just 1&#x02009;mL, the plasma jet could not touch liquid due to the exposure of the bottom of well. When the volume of liquid was up to 2&#x02009;mL, the extrusion of liquid would be weaker and enabled the plasma jet to touch the liquid layer. However, even when the plasma jet does not touch the liquid, the reactive species are still able to dissolve into the liquid. Yonemori <italic>et al.</italic> observed that when an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet touched a glass surface, it flowed radically over the glass surface and formed a large area containing reactive species on the glass surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Thus, the reactive species in the plasma jet should affect an area of liquid that is significantly larger than the diameter of the jet. The half-life of .OH is only a few microseconds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, however, which eliminates the possibility that .OH diffuses over the liquid surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a</xref>). In contrast, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO with much longer half-life may enter the media by the diffusion over the whole surface of liquid. We denote that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO area and .OH area to represent the area mainly affected by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO and .OH on the liquid surface covered by plasma flow, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a</xref>). Together, when the volume of media is relative small, .OH will not be a main factor to directly affect the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media. .OH may react with .OH to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and affects the anti-tumor capacity indirectly.</p><p>If H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO area and .OH area do exist as we depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>, it is reasonable to deduce that the surface of media irradiated by the plasma may affect the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO but not .OH in the CAPs media. We proved this deduction by measuring the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO and .OH in the CAPs media and CAPs MB solution in distinct multi-well plates, respectively. The well diameters on 48-well, 24-well, 12-well, and 6-well plate were 10.2&#x02009;mm, 15.4&#x02009;mm, 21.4&#x02009;mm, and 35.0&#x02009;mm, respectively. We found that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO concentration in the CAPs media varied significantly with the well size on the plate. The larger diameter of well, the more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO accumulated in the CAPs media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). By contrast, the .OH generation in the CAPs MB solution doesn&#x02019;t significantly vary with the well size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), even when the volume of MB solution is up to 2&#x02009;mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The .OH generation in the CAPs MB solution from a 6-well plate is noticeably lower than that from other plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p>A schematic illustration in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2b</xref> depicts the underlying mechanism of the well size-effect on the reactive species accumulation. A smaller well creates a smaller H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO area on the media surface. More H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO will diffuse into the CAPs media when the well size becomes larger. Additionally, the thickness of media in the well increases as the well size decreases. The calculated liquid thickness of 1&#x02009;mL media in 48-well, 24-well, 12-well, 6-well plate are 12.2&#x02009;mm, 5.4&#x02009;mm, 2.8&#x02009;mm, and 1.0&#x02009;mm, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2b</xref>). Thus, the extrusion of media due to the plasma jet pressure will be weakened as the diameter of well decreases. When the volume of MB solution is just 1&#x02009;mL, compared with the MB solution in 6-well plate, the MB solution in other multi-well plates is more likely to contact the .OH in the CAP. Thus, more MB is consumed in the CAPs MB solution from 48-well, 24-well, and 12-well plate than that from 6-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Even when the volume of MB solution is 2&#x02009;mL, .OH is only able to affect a small area on the media directly touched by the CAP jet, so the .OH generation in the CAPs MB solution changes little when the well size is noticeably altered. In short, the distinct half-life among H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO and .OH underlies the different well size-effect of reactive species observed in this study.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media is dose-dependent and well size-dependent</title><p>We further investigated the anti-tumor capacity of CAPs media on glioblastoma cells (U87), breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) with distinct cell confluences. It was found that the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media increases as the treatment time (dose) increases and decreases as the cell seeding confluence decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). Thus, it is the dose of CAP treatment exerting on a unit cell, rather than the whole CAP treatment dose, that determines the fate of cancer cells. In addition, MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells are more vulnerable to the CAPs media than U87 cells. The response of MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells to the CAPs media is similar, though MCF-7 cells are a little easier to be killed.</p><p>We further investigated effect of well size on the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media on the same three cancer cell lines. We found that the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media decreased as the size of the wells decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d&#x02013;g</xref>). For U87 cells, the residual viability of cells cultured in the CAPs media from a 6-well plate is about 1/3 of the viability of cells cultured in the CAPs media from a 48-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In other words, at least 2/3 of the anti-cancer ability of the CAPs media is wasted in the 48-well plate. A similar trend is also observed on MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). However, the well size-effect on MCF-7 cells only appears when the seeding confluence is as high as 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;cells/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>), which may be due to the fact that even the CAPs media from a 48-well plate is adequate to kill almost all MCF-7 cells with a seeding confluence as low as 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;cells/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Accordingly, the 96-well plate should waste more reactive species. By surveying all publications about the application of plasma jet on cancer treatment, it was determined that only 25% publications used 6-well plate or dish with same size in their CAP treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, most investigations wasted significant amount of plasma, gas and media over the past decade. The dose-dependent and the well size-dependent anti-cancer features of the CAPs media is consisted with the dose-dependent and liquid surface-dependent reactive species accumulation patterns in the CAPs media.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media varies with the gap between plasma source and media</title><p>For the media in the well with identical volume, when the well size decreases, the height of the media in the well increases. Thus, the well size-dependent effect may be due to the altered size of the gap between the surface of the media and the plasma source. We investigated the generation of NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in CAPs media by altering the gap between the bottom of plate and the nozzle of quartz tube. We found that the NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAPs media shown a distinct response to a change in gap. As the gap increases from 2&#x02009;cm to 4&#x02009;cm, the concentration of NO in the CAPs media shows a parabolic response. It reaches a peak at the gap of 3&#x02009;cm and then decreases as the gap is increased to 4&#x02009;cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The distribution of NO along the axial direction of the atmospheric pressure plasma jet has been measured by laser induced fluorescence and showed similar trend as we observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In contrast, the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> shows a stepwise change upon the gap increase. The concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAPs media remains fairly constant over the gap of 2&#x02009;cm to 3&#x02009;cm. When the gap increased from 3&#x02009;cm to 4&#x02009;cm, the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAPs media decreased about 26% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Next, we investigated the viability change of three cancer cell lines upon the gap change. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c&#x02013;e</xref>, the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media dose not noticeably change until the gap increases to 3.5&#x02009;cm or 4&#x02009;cm. The gap-effect on the anti-cancer capacity is consistent with the gap-effect on the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but significantly differs from the gap-effect on the generation of NO. It indicates that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rather than NO may dominate the death of cancer cells. Ultimately, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> proves that the well size-effect on the CAPs media is not due the gap-effect. Because the smaller gap only tends to generate more reactive species, the actual well size-effect should be stronger than that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The anti-cancer capacity is volume-dependent</title><p>As early as 2007, it was found that melanoma cells could be protected in FE-DBD treatment by varying depth of cell growth media<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, the mechanism underlying the protecting role of media remains obscure. As we have demonstrated, the strong anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media always accompanies a high concentration of species in the media. Because the increase of media depth means the increase of media volume in the same container, the protecting role of media may just due to the dilution of reactive species in the media. We investigated the volume-effect on the anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media. It was found that both the concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>) and NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>) decreased as the volume of media increased. Furthermore, the killing capacities of the CAPs media on three cancer cell lines significantly decreased as the volume of media increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c&#x02013;e</xref>). In short, the protecting role of media is due to the dilution-effect of the reactive species. According to this principle, the optimized anti-cancer capacity of CAP treatment, direct or indirect, can be achieved when cells are surrounded by a few media.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cysteine and tryptophan are the main targets of effective species in the CAPs media</title><p>Here, we denote effective species to represent the effective reactive species which kill cancer cells. Understanding the chemical essence of the reaction between the effective species and the intracellular molecules is a prerequisite to understanding the mechanism underlying the anti-cancer capacity of CAP treatment. However, to study the intracellular reaction between RNS/ROS with the thousands of intracellular molecules directly is too challenging to be performed. In this study, we focused on revealing which amino acids significantly reacted with the effective species. The interaction between CAP and the amino acid solution have been studied via mass spectra. It was found that the sulfur-containing and aromatic amino acids in the aqueous solution were preferentially consumed in the CAP treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Methionine, cysteine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine were the five most consumed reactive amino acids upon the CAP treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. However, some amino acids may be consumed by the species which do not kill cancer cells. The revealed reaction types between amino acids and plasma have not answered the question of which amino acids tend to react with the effective species.</p><p>We harnessed a novel strategy to reveal the reaction strength among effective species and specific amino acids. We used cancer cells as a cell probe to investigate whether the effective species in the CAPs media would be consumed by particular amino acids via comparing the anti-cancer capacity of a specific 2.4&#x02009;mM CAPs amino acids rich DMEM with the corresponding untreated amino acids rich DMEM. Each amino acids rich DMEM was prepared by dissolving specific amino acids powers in DMEM.</p><p>Among 20 amino acids, cysteine and tryptophan showed the strongest reactivity towards the effective species in CAPs media. In contrast to DMEM, the cysteine rich DMEM consumes most effective species and almost completely eliminates the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs DMEM on U87 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>), and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Tryptophan has a similar but weaker capacity to consume effective species. A control group was also analyzed for each amino acid tested, because if a specific amino acid rich DMEM is toxic to cancer cells, the corresponding control group has a very low cell viability, which makes the relative cell viability in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> appears very large. As a result, we may get a delusion that a toxic amino acid consumes most effective species. In this study, for U87 cells and MCF-7 cells, tryptophan shows a strong resistance to growth of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4a,c</xref>). The mechanism underlying this toxicity is unclear. We also found that the tryptophan-rich DMEM did not resist the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4b</xref>). Thus, the weak anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs tryptophan rich DMEM on MDA-MB-231 cells conclusively demonstrates that tryptophan is the second most sensitive amino acid to the effective species. In addition, the CAP treated DMEM tends to cause the most cell death among most CAPs amino acid rich DMEM. Thus, the effective species in CAP reacts with wide range of amino acids. Other than cysteine and tryptophan, arginine, lysine, asparagine, and glutamine also react significantly with the effective species in the CAPs media. Thus, they should also be the hot targets of effective species.</p><p>Furthermore, we studied the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO in the CAPs amino acid rich DMEM, which will reveal the species reacting strongly with specific amino acids. In contrast to NO, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is more likely to be the effective species, because no significant difference of NO generation exists between different CAPs amino acids rich DMEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>), while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAP simulated amino acid DMEM varied specifically with the amino acids in DMEM. Most of the hot targeted amino acids of effective species are also capable of consuming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> significantly in the CAPs DMEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). There are 15 amino acids that consume the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in the CAPs DMEM, which is consistent with the conclusion made above that many amino acids react with the effective species in the CAP treated DMEM. Among them, cysteine rich DMEM consumes almost all H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Despite tryptophan is the second most sensitive amino acids to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, it just consumes about 23% of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as cysteine does.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer cells consume the reactive species with a cell line-dependent pattern</title><p>Due to the obscure essence of the effective species in the CAP, the consumption speed of the effective species by cancer cells has not been reported. Briefly, in this study, we harnessed one cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) as the cell probe to investigate how much the effective species were left in the CAPs media which had been used to culture three cancer cell lines for a period of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). We denoted such CAPs media and such time as residual media and consumption time, respectively. The viability of cell probes (MDA-MB-231) was inversely proportional to the concentration of residual effective species in the residual media. The detailed protocols were illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>. It has been found that the effective species in the residual media are gradually consumed by all three cell lines, which causes the viability of cell probe (MDA-MB-231 cells) cultured in residual media to increase as the consumption time increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). In addition, the cell probe (MDA-MB-231 cells) cultured in the residual media which has been used to culture U87 cells obtains higher cell viability than the cell probe cultured in the residual media which has been used to culture MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). In other words, U87 cells consume the effective species significantly faster than MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells. For U87 cells, the residual CAPs media almost completely lose its anti-cancer capacity 3&#x02009;hours after treatment. In contrast, for MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells, the CAPs media still maintain significant anti-cancer capacity 3&#x02009;hours after treatment. MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells consumes the effective species similarly.</p><p>Because H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was regarded as the main effective species in the CAPs media, we further investigated the decay speed of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the residual media by measuring the evolution of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAPs media which had been used to culture three cell lines. We found that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the residual media which had been used to culture U87 cells decayed noticeably faster than the cells in the residual media which had been used to culture MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>). Thus, U87 cells are capable of consuming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> faster than MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone does not equal to the CAPs media</title><p>To investigate whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was the sole factor in causing the death of cancer cells, we studied the response of three cancer cell lines to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rich media. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rich media was prepared by adding 30&#x02009;wt % H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution (Sigma-Aldrich) into the complete media. Because H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reacted with proteins in the complete media, the real concentration measured by Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) was much less than the nominal concentration based on calculation in preparation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10</xref>, the growth of three cell lines presents a similar concentration (dose)-dependent response to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rich media. The growth of three cell lines will not be drastically suppressed until the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is adequately large. It is not surprising, because high dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produces cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. However, the responses of three cancer cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are quite different. Generally, U87 cells and MCF-7 cells show stronger resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than MDA-MB-231 cells. U87 cells and MCF-7 cells share a similar response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> except when the nominal concentration is between 20 to 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. Clearly, the selective anti-tumor capacity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on three cells lines are distinct from that of the CAPs media on these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). U87 cells are more resistant to the CAPs media than both MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells are a slightly more resistant to the CAPs media than MCF-7 cells. These differences demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not the only reactive specie to cause the death of cancer cells. Some other species also play necessary role. Cysteine may react with not only H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but also other effective species in the CAPs media.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>So far, the anti-tumor capacity of CAP treatment has been regulated by controlling the treatment time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, the gas sources composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, the gas flow rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and the supply voltages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.

In this study, we demonstrated several methods to obtain stronger anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media. Specifically, the CAP treatment should be performed in a container with a large diameter. In addition, the gap between the plasma source and the media should be adequately small. To obtain high reactive species concentration, the volume of media should be relative small. Because these principles are fit for all cell lines involved in this study, they may be universal for other cancer cells.</p><p>Because 20 amino acids are the building blocks of all proteins, cysteine, the most reactive amino acid determined by cell probes, should also be the main targeted amino acid residue on the intracellular proteins or other small molecules. Intracellular ROS levels and redox balance are tightly regulated by multiple antioxidant defense systems, including small antioxidant molecules such as glutathione, NAD(P)H and ROS-scavenging enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Redox status of thiol group on the cysteine residue directly determines the function of glutathione peroxidase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, thioredoxin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, thioredoxin reductase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, and peroxiredoxin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. When thiold group on the cysteine residue was oxidized, corresponding normal function of some anti-oxidant enzymes or small molecules will be completely lost. Here, we take glutathione, the most abundant small molecular thiol inside mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, as an example. Reduced form of glutathione (GH) is a tripeptide with a cysteine residue in the middle. When GH is oxidized, the cysteine residue will form a disulfide bond with the cysteine residue on another GH. Such product is denoted as GSSG. GSSG loses the ability to be a anti-oxidant molecule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Actually, the weakend antioxidant system has been observed in the plasma treated cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.

Only the high dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can produce cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The toxicity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is exaggerated by the Fenton reaction between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> in cells, which generates high reactive .OH and causes damage to DNA and other important intracellular molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been proposed as a key species to cause the death of cancer cells after CAP treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.

Our study revealed that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rich media could not generate the same selective killing on cancer cell lines as well as the CAPs media did. Thus, the CAP treatment can not equate to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p><p>In contrast to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NO was not likely to be the main effective species. However, the real role of NO in killing cancer cells has not been deeply explored in this study. Theoritically, NO may result in the general observed ROS increase and the death of cancer cells after CAP treatment. NO is able to increase intracellular ROS levels by blocking the electron transport chain in mitochondria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref> and inactivating the glutathione peroxidase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. NO reacts with superoxide to generate peroxynitrite, which will not only attack DNA but also weaken the antioxidant system via the inactivation of manganese-superoxide dismutase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>, glutathione peroxidase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, glutathione reductase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>, catalase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>, and peroxiredoxin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. In addition, other effective species which have not been studied may also contribute to the death of cancer cells. Thus, the number of species that codetermine the anti-cancer capacity of CAPs media is still unknown.</p><p>Recently, two trends regarding the response of cancer cells to the CAP treatment have been found. First, the anti-tumor capacity of CAP on cancer cells is proportional to the growth speed of cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Second, the cancer cells carrying mutated p53 genes are more vulnerable to the CAP treatment than the cancer cells carrying wild p53 genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. The second trend might explain the first trend to some extent. Cancer cell lines carrying the mutated p53 gene tend to obtain malignant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref> or metastasis phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref> and overcome growth arrest and senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>. The cancer cells in metastasis stage own prosperous metabolism and high ROS level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>. Thus, the fast growing cancer cells without a normal, functional p53 gene are more vulnerable to the CAP treatment. In this study, however, we found a new trend that the cancer cells that could absorb or eliminate the effective species in the surrounding environment faster would be more resistant to the CAPs media. Despite the fact that the intrinsic relationship between these trends was obscure, we demonstrated that the absorption capacity on the effective species and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by cancer cells significantly varied with the cell lines.</p><p>The absorption of reactive species, mainly H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in this study, directly relates to the diffusion speed of reactive species across the cellular membrane. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been regarded as a molecule that is able to freely cross the phospholipid membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>. Recent investigations revealed that diffusion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> across phospholipid membrane was limited by the membrane composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>. Due to the highly similarity among H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and water, aquaporins (AQPs), a membrane protein family facilitating the transport of water across the cellular membrane, also plays an important role in facilitating the passive diffusion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>. Not all AQPs are able to transport H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. So far, only the transport of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by AQP1 and AQP8 has been investigated. AQP1 with a relative smaller pore diameter in the selectivity filter region (2.7&#x02009;&#x000c5;) cannot transport H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>. By contrast, due to the larger pore diameter (3.2&#x02009;&#x000c5;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, AQP8 is able to transport H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> across the cellular membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref>. AQPs are expressed to varying degrees in different types of human tumors. For example, AQP1, 4, and 5 highly express in breast cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>. AQP1, 4, 8, and 9 highly express in glioblastoma cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">81</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">82</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">83</xref>. The distinct expression pattern of AQP8 in glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells can explain why H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is consumed faster by U87 cells than MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Nonetheless, if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the main effective species to kill cancer cells, the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level should be at least codetermined by the diffusion speed of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> across the cell membrane and the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>. Thus, we may not be able to predict the vulnerability of cancer cells to the CAPs media only based on the distinct consumption speeds of cancer cells. More research focusing the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging capacity in distinct cancer cells should be carried out in the future.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we demonstrated several principles to optimize the anti-tumor capacity of the CAPs media on glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells. Specifically, a larger well, a closer gap between plasma source and media, and a smaller volume of media produce a stronger anti-cancer CAPs media. Breast cancer cells are more vulnerable to the CAPs media than glioblastoma cells. In addition, compared with NO, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAPs media is likely to be the main effective species to kill cancer cells. The effective species in the CAPs media mainly react with cysteine, which explains the rise of intracellular ROS in the CAP treated cancer cells. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the CAPs media cause distinct selective killing patterns in cancer cells, indicating that other reactive species may also affect the death of cancer cells. Glioblastoma cells are able to consume effective species and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the CAPs media significantly faster than breast cancer cells, which may relate to the distinct expressions of cell membrane proteins on cancer cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Human U87 cells were provided by Dr. Murad&#x02019;s Lab at the George Washington University.

The equivalent CAP treatment time (eqT) is shown in the bottom of figure. eqT was calculated based on the formula that eqT&#x02009;=&#x02009;(measured H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rich media, mC)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(conversion coefficient, cC). Here, cC is 0.03. For example, eqT of 1.211&#x02009;=&#x02009;mC of 40.35 times cC of 0.03. To obtain cC, we first measured the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the media which has been treated by CAP for 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2&#x02009;min. Then, the linear fitting between the measured H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration and the treatment time helped us to get cC.
