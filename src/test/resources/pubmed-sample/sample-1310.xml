Previously, we reported an association between SNP markers of SCNN1B gene and disease severity in cystic fibrosis-affected sibling pairs. We hypothesized that factors interacting with the SCNN1B genomic sequence are responsible for intrapair discordance. Concordant and discordant pairs differed at six <italic>SCNN1B</italic> markers (Praw&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0075, Pcorr&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0397 corrected for multiple testing). To identify the factors binding to these six SCNN1B SNPs, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and captured the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes. Based on protein mass spectrometry data, the epithelial splicing regulatory protein ESRP2 was identified when using <italic>SCNN1B</italic>-derived probes and the ESRP2-<italic>SCNN1B</italic> interaction was independently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays. We observed an alternative SCNN1B transcript and demonstrated in 16HBE14o&#x02212; cells that levels of this transcript are decreased upon ESRP2 silencing by siRNA. Furthermore, we confirmed that mildly and severely affected siblings have different ESPR2 genetic backgrounds and that ESRP2 markers are linked to the response of CF patients&#x02019; nasal epithelium to amiloride, indicating ENaC involvement (Pbest&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0131, Pcorr&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.068 for multiple testing). Our findings demonstrate that sibling pairs clinically discordant for CF can be used to identify meaningful DNA regulatory elements and interacting factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Gene regulation</kwd><kwd>Genetic association study</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Fritz Thyssen Stiftung (Fritz Thyssen Foundation)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Az.20.08.0.044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Deutsche Zentrum f&#x000fc;r Lungenforschung (German Center for Lung Research)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Projekt DEAL</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Genetic variation in humans contributes significantly to phenotypic variation. The question of which single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) determines disease outcome and/or severity, has been addressed in more than 2000 genome-wide association studies (GWAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, the results have revealed that more than 90% of the polymorphisms identified by GWAS do not directly alter the gene&#x02019;s coding sequence. This has led to the conclusion that clinically relevant variation of the human genome mediates gene regulation, i.e., the transcript expression level or the composition of transcript isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Recent genome and epigenome studies have substantiated this hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Enrichment of elements known for covalent modifications of DNA bases or their associated nucleosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> among disease- and trait-associated genetic variants determined by GWAS has also been noted.</p><p id="Par3">The gene affected in cystic fibrosis (CF), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), encodes a chloride- and bicarbonate channel of epithelia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> that localizes with the epithelial sodium channel ENaC at the apical membrane of many<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, albeit not all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, epithelial cells. Both CFTR and ENaC act synergistically to regulate salt and fluid transport across the epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and the SCNN1B gene, encoding the beta subunit of ENaC, is a highly plausible modifier gene of CF.</p><p id="Par4">Previously, we focused on the three genes encoding the subunits of ENaC as candidate genes in the European CF twin and sibling study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In an association study on extreme phenotypes, anthropometry and lung function data were used to select patients whose clinical data fell below the 25th centile (severely affected) or above the 75th centile (mildly affected) for both clinical parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Three groups of affected patient pairs were defined as follows by a ranking algorithm used to describe the severity of CF: concordant mildly affected sibling pairs, concordant severely affected sibling pairs and discordant sibling pairs. Discordant sibling pairs were composed of one mildly and one severely affected sibling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">When discordant sibling pairs were compared to concordant sibling pairs, one <italic>SCNN1B</italic> haplotype defined by SNPs rs238547&#x02013;rs152730&#x02013;rs250563 occurred more frequently among discordant than among concordant siblings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We concluded that this signal cannot be fully explained by a variant observed within <italic>SCNN1B</italic> because discordant siblings have a dissimilar phenotype by definition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and yet these siblings share an <italic>SCNN1B</italic> intragenic haplotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Our working hypothesis relied on the idea that the association signal in <italic>SCNN1B</italic> delineates a functional regulatory element, whereby a DNA-binding protein encoded <italic>in trans</italic> interacts with this regulatory element, stably binding to the haplotype of the regulatory element that is predominant among discordant siblings. Hence, the genetic variation of the interaction partner can determine the phenotype causing intrapair discordance in affected sibling pairs.</p><p id="Par6">In association studies involving affected patient pairs, interaction between a regulatory element and a DNA-binding protein may result in a paradoxical situation. The regulatory element is recognized through an INTERpair comparison by an association with the phenotype &#x0201c;discordance of sibs&#x0201d;. However, genetic information at the regulatory element is shared by both siblings within a pair, which provides an opportunity to identify the DNA-binding protein encoded <italic>in trans</italic> by an INTRApair comparison. If the phenotype is caused by interaction of the DNA-binding protein with the regulatory element, mildly and severely affected siblings of discordant pairs must carry different genetic information at the locus encoding the DNA-binding protein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Six SNPs within SCNN1B differ between concordant and discordant CF patient pairs</title><p id="Par7">We previously reported that intrapair discordance for CF disease severity is associated with three intragenic markers spanning <italic>SCNN1B</italic> from codon 3 to codon 293. To describe the genomic fragment for which concordant and discordant pairs carry different genetic information, we analyzed 7 previously typed markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and 49 SNPs genotyped for fine-mapping in the 16p12 region, encompassing the entire <italic>SCNN1G/SCNN1B</italic>-locus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Next, we employed a haplotype-based fine-mapping strategy previously used to identify causative variants within this cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To determine whether concordant and discordant pairs carried the same or different genetic information, we employed the software package FAMHAP to construct two-marker haplotypes composed of two informative markers. By using this approach, we found a significant difference in two-marker-haplotype distributions for two adjacent genomic fragments defined by markers rs152730&#x02013;rs152745 and rs152745&#x02013;rs152740 (Praw&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0075 and Praw&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00869, respectively; corrected for multiple testing of all informative markers at the <italic>SCNN1G/SCNN1B</italic>-locus Pcorr&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0397, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We concluded that the variant(s) that determine intrapair discordance are located on the genomic fragment between rs152730 and rs152740. Based on the allele frequency distribution among concordant and discordant pairs, we selected representatives for the contrasting haplotypes for Sanger resequencing of the mapped genomic fragment (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We chose three homozygotes for the haplotype TTAGA, two homozygotes for the haplotype GGAAT and one homozygote for the haplotype GTCAT for sequencing of the rs152730&#x02013;rs152740 genomic fragment on contrasting alleles at markers rs152730&#x02013;rs8044970&#x02013;rs63982&#x02013;rs152745&#x02013;rs152740. We used long-range PCR to amplify an 8269&#x000a0;bp and an 8856&#x000a0;bp product encompassing the sequence of interest (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Sanger sequencing was performed using internal primers positioned every 500&#x000a0;bp on the forward and reverse strands. Using the software CodonCode Aligner, 476 primary reads with a median length of 737&#x000a0;bp were aligned to the reference sequence, assuring coverage of at least 4 reads per haplotype at each genomic position. Based on this alignment, we identified 6 SNP positions for carriers of the contrasting haplotypes for which concordant and discordant pairs had different genetic information. At the six SNPs rs152730&#x02013;rs152731&#x02013;rs152745&#x02013;rs152744&#x02013;rs152741&#x02013;rs152740, alleles associated with intrapair concordance carried the haplotype GCAGTT; in contrast, alleles associated with intrapair discordance carried the haplotype TTGACA. None of these six SNPs reside within the coding sequence of <italic>SCNN1B.</italic> However, according to in silico analyses, they possibly alter the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA (SupplTab. 1, SupplTab. 2, SupplFig. 1).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mapping of the association signal determining intrapair discordance among F508del-CFTR homozygous CF sibling pairs, identification of an alternative SCNN1B transcript and position of SNPs analyzed by EMSA-PSeq.

The position of genetic markers was derived from the genomic sequence on NC_000016 (assembly 03-Feb-2014; GRCh38; region 23302270&#x02013;23381299). Nomenclature of <italic>SCNN1B</italic> exons was derived from Voilley et al. 1995<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> and Saxena et al. 1998<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, who have described exon/intron borders and the coding sequence for a 640 amino acid SCNN1B protein encoded by 13 exons (NP_000327.2; GI: 124301196; CCDS10609.1). The position of intragenic primers and expected sizes of amplicons covering exon 1&#x02013;5 of <italic>SCNN1B</italic> are based on this coding sequence.

A second independent association signal with intrapair discordance in the SCNN1G locus colocalizes with the previously noted survivor effect at SCNN1G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and was excluded from further analysis because of this confounding factor.

Interaction partners of SNPs rs152730, rs152731 and rs152744, indicated by red star symbols, have been characterized by EMSA-PSeq. Equivalent amounts of cDNA from T84 (I), 16HBE14o-(II), CFTE29o-(III) and CFBE41o-(IV) or no template (negative control, N) were analyzed by combinatorial PCR with 5 amplicons. The grey intronic sequence (amplicon 1, 2, 3) was derived from ESTs BM694355 and BU730506 (see text and supplement for details). Intron-spanning primers targeting the SCNN1B reference mRNA (amplicons 4 and 5) as well as amplicon 1 targeting the alternative transcript and the 5&#x02032; UTR were observed in all cell lines. The size of amplified products from all amplicons was in accordance with the expected length. Size markers are loaded in lanes indicated by &#x0201c;&#x02014;&#x0201d; and contain either a 100-bp-ladder or PCR products of 697&#x000a0;bp, 329&#x000a0;bp, 280&#x000a0;bp and 170&#x000a0;bp as indicated adjacent to the gel.

epithelial cell lines</title><p id="Par8">Because none of the six identified SNPs affect the amino acid sequence of the SCNN1B protein, we next aimed to determine whether <italic>SCNN1B</italic> undergoes alternative splicing. Alternative transcripts were inferred from mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs, SupplFig. 2). As a source for polyA&#x02009;+&#x02009;RNA, we used T84 cells, which are derived from colon carcinoma, 16HBE14o-cells, which are virus-transformed non-CF respiratory epithelial cells, and CFBE41o- and CFTE29o-cells, both of which are immortalized respiratory epithelial cells derived from F508del-CFTR homozygous CF patients. Primers for combinatorial reverse-transcription PCR were designed to reflect ESTs reported for SCNN1B in the area of interest defined by SNPs rs152730&#x02013;rs152740 (SupplFig. 2A). By using primers located in exons 3 and 4 or exons 3 and 5, we detected wild-type SCNN1B in all four epithelial cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Additionally, we amplified a 280&#x000a0;bp product using one primer located within exon 3 and one primer located 100&#x000a0;bp 3&#x02032; of the splice site at the end of exon 3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and SupplFig. 2). We specifically investigated this intronic sequence because it has been reported to be retained in EST clones BM694355 and BU730506, which are generated from a cDNA library prepared from retinal pigment epithelium of a healthy adult male. Primers designed to detect ESTs AW844136, CV337204 and BX485038 did not amplify a product (SupplFig. 2). The 280&#x000a0;bp product, derived from the alternative SCNN1B transcript generated by exon read-through, was reliably amplified from T84 derived cDNA even when the RNA was pretreated with DNAse (SupplFig 2). Moreover, Sanger sequencing of the alternative product confirmed its identity at the exon 3/intron 3 border. Hence, the alternative mRNA was generated by an exon read-through event and matched the genomic sequence by the base (SupplFig 2E). Furthermore, primers placed upstream in exon 1 encoding the 5&#x02032; UTR of SCNN1B in combination with a primer placed on the retained intron sequence yielded a product from cDNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Conversely, no signal was observed when using a primer located in the downstream exon 5 in combination with the retained intron sequence (data not shown). To summarize, cancer-derived intestinal epithelial cells as well as virus-immortalized respiratory epithelial cells expressed an alternative <italic>SCNN1B</italic> transcript in which intron 3 was partially retained. If translated, this alternative transcript would preserve the reading frame at the end of exon 3 and would be translated into a protein that terminates prematurely after an 26 additional amino acids derived from the retained intron sequence, producing a severely truncated SCNN1B protein of 221 amino acids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The <italic>SCNN1B</italic> haplotype found in discordant pairs is enriched for predicted transcription factor binding sites</title><p id="Par9">We next assumed that an allelic association with a discordant manifestation of CF severity is mediated by factors that recognize the allele enriched among discordant pairs. To test our hypothesis, we assessed whether the 6-marker-haplotype that is associated with intrapair discordance for CF severity, i.e., whether TTGACA at the six SNPs rs152730&#x02013;rs152731&#x02013;rs152745&#x02013;rs152744&#x02013;rs152741&#x02013;rs152740 attracts different DNA-binding proteins compared to the GCAGTT allele that is observed among concordant sibling pairs. To identify potential transcription factor binding sites, we used the tool &#x0201c;Match&#x0201d; (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gene-regulation.com/">http://www.gene-regulation.com/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which is based on a library of mononucleotide weight matrices from TRANSFAC6.0.

As an input sequence, we used both alleles at each of the six divergent SNPs and&#x02009;+&#x02009;/&#x02212; 20&#x000a0;bp flanking sequences. Next, we compared the list of putative transcription factor binding sites between the input sequences derived from haplotypes associated with concordance and discordance and noted those predicted to interact with only one of the two contrasting alleles at each SNP. Surprisingly, only 6 binding sites were predicted for the haplotype observed among concordant sibling pairs; 21 predicted interactions were exclusively related to the six-marker-haplotype associated with intrapair discordance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, SupplTab 3a).

Briefly, we used nuclear extracts derived from epithelial cells and biotinylated 35-mer dsDNA probes that centrally carry one of the contrasting alleles of the SNPs as bait. To separate the unbound probe from the probe-protein-complexes, we performed native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the probe-protein-complexes were visualized after transfer of the separated samples to a membrane. The gel fragment corresponding to the signal generated by the probe-protein-complex was excised, and proteins within the excised gel fragment were identified by protein mass spectrometry. We used the NFkappaB-P65-consensus sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> for optimization of the experimental setup. Protein mass spectrometry and MASCOT analysis identified several hundred proteins per high-molecular weight complex. To enable the recognition of proteins that incidentally comigrate together with the probe/protein complex and/or that bind to any DNA unspecifically, and/or are introduced to the sample as contaminants during handling of the gel fragment, a set of 25 EMSA-PSeq experiments were performed in parallel for noise filtering (SupplFig 3).

However, high-molecular-weight DNA&#x02013;protein-complexes were observed with probes representing the two contrasting alleles at SNPs rs152730, rs152731 and rs152744.

Due to the high power of this approach, it was estimated that the genotyping load for studies undertaken with an extreme sib-pair design, selecting for patient pairs who exhibit phenotypes below the 30th or above the 70th centile, can be reduced by up to 40-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Pulmonary and gastrointestinal disease manifestations were assessed quantitatively by CF population centiles for the normalized forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV1) and by weight as a percentage of predicted weight for height. For these two parameters, we selected sibling pairs with extreme phenotypes in the upper and lower 25%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Our selection criteria were in line with recommendations proposed by Risch and Zhang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, however, these criteria resulted in a small study population, thus limiting the power of the genetic association study. Moreover, since our study population is of white European descent, a group in which F508del-CFTR is the most common mutation causing CF, we cannot be certain that our findings can be applied to other populations.</p><p id="Par21">Risch and Zhang concluded from their simulation studies that &#x0201c;extremely discordant sibling pairs represent a powerful design for the association studies of candidate genes&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and our findings fully support this idea. The use of sibling pairs with extreme clinical phenotypes has been applied before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and our data support the notion that gene&#x02013;gene interactions mediated by factors encoded <italic>in trans</italic> of the studied locus can be distinguished in an association study when mildly and severely affected siblings of discordant pairs are compared (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Identifying <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory elements in SCNN1B.

The genetic variation at ESRP2 contributes to the manifestation of SCNN1B functionality. In this model, binding sites for DNA interacting partners are shown as a triangular groove (for interaction partners shaped as a triangle) and as a square groove (for interaction partners shaped as a square). In the context of this work, ESRP2 is represented by a square and fits into its binding side at the SCNN1B locus. As a consequence, the phenotype of a sib within a discordant pair is shaped by the interaction of ESRP2 and SCNN1B: the allele rs152731-T, associated with intrapair discordance (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>,<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), is more vulnerable to ESRP2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and its genetic variations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Functionally divergent ESRP2 alleles, visualized as green and blue squares, thus determine the phenotype of carriers with ESRP2-receptive SCNN1B alleles that are shown with a square groove.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of Hannover Medical School and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parental guardians. All methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The clinical characteristics of the patients have been described in detail elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Briefly, the 12% most informative pairs from the entire sample of 318 CF twin and sibling pairs for whom pulmonary function data and weight and height were available in 1996 were selected by a ranking algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To study genetic modifiers, we aimed to reduce the effect of the disease-causing CFTR gene on the disease phenotype, thus deciding to study only one CFTR mutation genotype. F508del-CFTR, present on 70% of CF chromosomes from white populations of Central and West-European countries, is the only CFTR mutation for which such an approach is feasible. Moreover, patient subsamples were examined to assess the manifestation of the basic defect of impaired ion conductance in the respiratory tissue, as determined in vivo by nasal potential difference measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and in intestinal tissue, as determined ex vivo by intestinal current measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Genetic information obtained from the case and reference populations with contrasting phenotypes was compared using the software package FAMHAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, which allows family-based analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, accepts data evaluation in association studies on unrelated individuals as well as on affected sibling pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and is adapted to handle intrapair comparison of genotype data in sibling pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Correction for multiple testing at loci typed with more than one marker was performed by haplotype permutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. For this purpose, the entire data set of cases and references was used to estimate haplotype frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. To ensure a consistent assignment of rare haplotypes in small subsamples, the genotype data of 101 families with a total of 171 patients from the European CF twin and sibling study were used as a training set in all comparisons. Haplotype, or, in cases of noninformative phase or haplotype uncertainty, weighted haplotype explanation lists were assigned to each individual whereby the haplotype frequencies of the entire data set were taken into account to compute conditional likelihood weights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Permutation was performed by randomly assigning the affection status to the individuals in each replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. For the comparison of case sibling pairs to reference sibling pairs, the affection status was permuted or not with an equal chance for both siblings simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.
