The standard comorbidity measure was compared to revised algorithms which included outpatient medications for diabetes, hypertension and smoking; an expanded timeframe encompassing the mastectomy admission; and an adjusted time interval and number of required outpatient claims. A &#x003c7;2 test of proportions was used to compare prevalence estimates for 5 conditions in the mastectomy population to national health survey datasets (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). Medical record review was conducted for a sample of women to validate the identification of smoking and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to the standard claims algorithm, use of the modified algorithms increased prevalence from 4.79 to 6.79&#x000a0;% for diabetes, 14.75 to 24.87&#x000a0;% for hypertension, 4.23 to 6.65&#x000a0;% for deficiency anemia, 1.78 to 12.87&#x000a0;% for smoking, and 1.14 to 6.31&#x000a0;% for obesity. The revised estimates were more similar, but not statistically equivalent, to nationally reported prevalence estimates. Medical record review revealed low sensitivity (17.86&#x000a0;%) to capture obesity in the claims, moderate negative predictive value (NPV, 71.78&#x000a0;%) and high specificity (99.15&#x000a0;%) and positive predictive value (PPV, 90.91&#x000a0;%); the claims algorithm for current smoking had relatively low sensitivity (62.50&#x000a0;%) and PPV (50.00&#x000a0;%), but high specificity (92.19&#x000a0;%) and NPV (95.16&#x000a0;%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Modifications to a standard comorbidity measure resulted in prevalence estimates that were closer to expected estimates for non-elderly women than the standard measure.

This is especially true when studying healthcare utilization, costs, and patient outcomes, in which underlying comorbid conditions are associated with the outcomes. The Charlson index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], a widely-used measure of 19 comorbidities, was adapted for administrative data using ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 9<sup>th</sup> Revision, Clinical Modification) codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A second commonly used comorbidity measure with claims data developed by Elixhauser includes 29 medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These measures were developed and validated in hospitalized patients, and therefore may be more applicable to older, sicker populations.</p><p>A number of studies have compared the performance of the Charlson and Elixhauser measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The best measure has generally been determined based on improvement in explanatory power with regard to a specific outcome, usually mortality. Many studies have concluded that that these measures perform equally well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], while others have found the Elixhauser classification improved prediction of in-hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and longer-term mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several investigators have expanded the parameters of these two comorbidity measures to include physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], outpatient, and auxiliary claims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and different look-back periods relative to the index event (e.g., one or two years of prior data and/or including the index admission) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>We have an ongoing study of risk factors for postoperative complications in women under the age of 65&#x000a0;years after mastectomy and breast reconstruction using commercial insurer claims data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Breast reconstruction is most commonly performed in younger women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] who have fewer underlying medical conditions (M. Olsen, unpublished results, National Inpatient Data) and lower annual healthcare costs than elderly women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], suggesting less healthcare utilization. Fewer healthcare encounters and hospitalizations could limit the identification of comorbid conditions in claims data. For example, methods that perform well in elderly populations, e.g., using only diagnoses on inpatient hospital claims, may not be optimal for younger, generally healthy populations with infrequent hospitalizations.</p><p>To address some of the challenges of capturing comorbidities in younger populations, we selected diabetes, hypertension, anemia (including iron, folate, vitamin B12, protein, and other nutritional deficiency anemias), smoking, and obesity as representative examples of commonly occurring underlying health conditions in younger persons, and to illustrate the impact of modifications to the standard claims algorithm to improve capture of comorbidities. One alteration included the addition of diagnosis codes during the index hospital admission, to capture conditions that might be more commonly coded during a hospitalization than during prior outpatient encounters. All five conditions we included in our study pertain to this example, since they may be considered relevant to care provided during an inpatient hospitalization, but may not be relevant to service(s) or procedure(s) rendered during an outpatient visit, a requirement for health insurance coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Another alteration included allowing only a single diagnosis code to identify conditions for which testing is not necessary, such as obesity and smoking. A third alteration consisted of relaxing the requirement for spacing of diagnoses coded during outpatient encounters at least 30&#x000a0;days apart, because of the potential for clustering of care within a short time frame in younger women diagnosed with breast cancer. We also examined the effect of prescription drug claims to identify a condition, using hypertension and diabetes as relevant conditions. Our objective was to compare the impact of these modifications to the standard claims algorithm to identify a comorbid health condition, using the expected population prevalence of the comorbid health condition and medical record review to signal improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data source</title><p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD<sup>SM</sup>). We used data in the HIRD<sup>SM</sup> from individuals enrolled in 12 Anthem-affiliated plans for this study. Anthem is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and serves its members as the Blue Cross licensee (California), and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee (Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC), and Wisconsin). Data in the HIRD<sup>SM</sup> include all fully-adjudicated claims submitted for reimbursement from providers, facilities, and outpatient pharmacies linked to health plan enrollment information.</p><p>Fully insured women with health plan enrollment that included non-capitated medical coverage of hospital and physician services and prescription drug coverage were eligible for inclusion in the study cohort. Men were excluded due to the rare incidence of breast cancer in men. Women lacking continuous coverage from 365&#x000a0;days before through 30&#x000a0;days after mastectomy were excluded since comorbid conditions could not be fully measured. Additional exclusions included women with diagnosis codes for end-stage renal disease because of potentially incomplete claims, ICD-9-CM diagnosis code or prescription claim suggesting HIV positive status at any time for privacy considerations, and organ transplant in the year before mastectomy due to the rare nature of their underlying illness. Claims were restricted to paid claims.</p><p>The study data contained up to 5 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and 5 ICD-9-CM procedure codes per claim among women with a mastectomy in 2004&#x02013;2008 and up to 12 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and 8 ICD-9-CM procedure codes among women with a mastectomy in 2009&#x02013;2011. Inpatient facility claims also included Uniform Billing (UB-04) revenue and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, while outpatient facility and provider claims included Current Procedural Terminology, 4<sup>th</sup> edition (CPT-4) and HCPCS codes. Pharmacy claims contained National Drug Codes, which were linked to Generic Product Identifier codes to identify medications and drug groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient population</title><p>We identified mastectomy operations among women aged 18&#x02013;64 years from 1/1/2004&#x02013;12/31/2011 using ICD-9-CM procedure codes 85.41&#x02013;85.48 from inpatient facility claims and/or CPT-4 procedure codes 19180, 19200&#x02013;19240, 19303, and 19305&#x02013;19307 from outpatient facility and provider claims. We included only the first mastectomy per woman during the time period. The patient population was further refined by excluding operations coded by a provider- or facility-only without additional evidence for operation (i.e., anesthesia, pathology, or surgery revenue code) and mastectomy with codes for breast-conserving surgery if provider and other claims suggested breast-conserving surgery was more likely to increase the chance that a mastectomy was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Comorbidity algorithms</title><p>We used the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes from the Elixhauser classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] to define diabetes, hypertension, anemia, and obesity (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Since smoking is not included in the Elixhauser list of comorbidities; we used ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for history of tobacco use and tobacco disorder to define smoking. We did not restrict the identification of conditions by diagnosis-related group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] since we wanted to identify all relevant comorbid conditions at the time of mastectomy. We examined the impact of outpatient prescription claims for medications used to treat diabetes, hypertension, and smoking cessation to enhance the detection of these conditions (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In order to focus on diagnoses recorded by clinicians, we excluded provider and outpatient facility claims containing only CPT-4 or UB-04 revenue codes for pharmacy, diagnostic radiology/cardiology/pulmonology, clinical laboratory, physical/occupational therapy, speech pathology or ambulance services. The timeframe used to identify comorbid conditions, frequency and interval between outpatient and provider claims, and use of prescription drug claims were changed sequentially to determine how the changes impacted the final prevalence calculated for each underlying condition (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Parameters for each algorithm used to identify comorbidities</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Algorithm</th><th>Comorbidity</th><th>Timeframe relative to mastectomy date (in days)</th><th>Number of inpatient facility medical claims required</th><th>Interval and number of provider or outpatient facility medical claims required</th><th>Number of prescription drug (Rx) claims required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Algorithm 1</td><td>Diabetes, hypertension, deficiency anemia, smoking, obesity</td><td>&#x02212;365 to &#x02212;1</td><td>1+</td><td>2+ more than 30&#x000a0;days apart</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Algorithm 2</td><td>Diabetes, hypertension, deficiency anemia, smoking, obesity</td><td>&#x02212;365 to +7</td><td>1+</td><td>2+ more than 30&#x000a0;days apart</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Algorithm 3</td><td>Diabetes, hypertension, deficiency anemia</td><td>&#x02212;365 to +7</td><td>1+</td><td>2+</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Smoking, obesity</td><td>&#x02212;365 to +7</td><td>1+</td><td>1+</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Algorithm 4</td><td>Diabetes</td><td>&#x02212;365 to +7<break/>&#x02212;365 to &#x02212;1 Rx</td><td>1+</td><td>2+</td><td>1+</td></tr><tr><td>Hypertension</td><td>&#x02212;365 to +7<break/>&#x02212;365 to &#x02212;1 Rx</td><td>1+</td><td>2+</td><td>1+ Rx plus 1 hypertension medical claim</td></tr><tr><td>Smoking</td><td>&#x02212;365 to +7<break/>&#x02212;365 to &#x02212;1 Rx</td><td>1+</td><td>1+</td><td>1+</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

For algorithm 2, we expanded the timeframe to capture comorbid conditions in medical claims through 7&#x000a0;days after mastectomy. While the standard claims algorithm described by Klabunde does not include identification of comorbid conditions during the hospital admission because some conditions could have new onset during the hospital admission (e.g., blood loss anemia, electrolyte disturbances), the comorbid conditions we selected for these analyses were most likely pre-existing at the time of mastectomy. Additionally, our study population consisted of younger, privately insured women with a low frequency of inpatient hospitalizations in the year prior to mastectomy, giving little opportunity to identify comorbid conditions in prior inpatient admissions. We suspected that some health conditions would be more likely to be coded during the mastectomy hospitalization (e.g., smoking) because of its relevance to surgery, so this provided additional motivation to determine the impact of adding the surgical hospitalization to the algorithm to identify underlying health conditions.</p><p>The frequency and interval requirements for provider/outpatient facility claims were altered in algorithm 3. Because of potential clustering of medical encounters in women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, we considered&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 provider/outpatient facility claims consistent with the diagnosis of interest (i.e., dropped the requirement for spacing of outpatient diagnoses&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;days apart). For smoking and obesity, we considered single provider/outpatient facility claim(s) sufficient evidence since these conditions do not require diagnostic workup.</p><p>One or more prescription claims for medications to treat diabetes (oral hypoglycemic, insulin), hypertension, and smoking cessation from &#x02212;365 to &#x02212;1&#x000a0;days before mastectomy were added to algorithm 4 to detect these conditions (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At least one medical claim with a hypertension diagnosis was required in addition to a prescription claim for an anti-hypertensive medication, since drugs used for hypertension may also be used to treat other conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Comparison populations</title><p>Survey results from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and 2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] were used for the national estimates of the prevalence for each of the comorbid conditions. To best approximate our privately insured mastectomy cohort, weighted estimates for diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and obesity were calculated from female BRFSS respondents aged 18&#x02013;64 years old with health insurance. In the surveys diabetes and hypertension were captured by the question &#x0201c;Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have (diabetes/high blood pressure)?&#x0201d; In both surveys BMI was defined using reported height and weight, and current smoking was defined on the basis of two questions: &#x0201c;Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Do you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?&#x0201d; The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (used as a proxy for all nutritional deficiency anemia) among adult females was available in a publication referencing NHANES data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the NHANES survey iron deficiency anemia was defined based on laboratory results from the respondent&#x02019;s blood sample. The age group level prevalence estimates from the NHANES publication were averaged for 20&#x02013;64 year olds to establish a single prevalence estimate for deficiency anemia. Because obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and hypertension and diabetes are more prevalent in obese persons, we assumed that women undergoing mastectomy would have higher rates of the selected conditions than the survey populations. While the survey populations may not be a gold-standard, the prevalence rates should serve as a baseline threshold for comparison to our study population.</p><p>For additional comparisons, a subset of the privately insured mastectomy population with postoperative ICD-9-CM diagnosis code(s) suggestive of wound complications was selected for medical record review. We selected this subset in order to validate the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for wound complications (manuscript in preparation), in addition to validation of the codes for obesity and smoking. For this subset height, weight, and current and past smoking history were abstracted from the medical records. Body mass index (BMI)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30 was used to define obesity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analysis</title><p>Wald confidence intervals were calculated for each condition prevalence estimate. A chi-square test of proportions was used to compare the different algorithms in the mastectomy cohort and estimates from BRFSS and NHANES. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to compare smoking and obesity data from the claims to the medical record results. All data management and statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

For all comorbid conditions, each change to the algorithm resulted in additional women detected with the underlying health condition and prevalence values closer to the national estimates for insured adult women, particularly for the younger women in our population. These five comorbid conditions served as illustrative examples of the range of opportunities to increase capture of comorbid conditions depending on the specific characteristics of the condition.</p><p>The inclusion of diagnosis codes from the mastectomy admission resulted in substantially increased prevalence of smoking, obesity, and hypertension. This finding is in agreement with previous studies which found the addition of diagnosis codes from the index admission was important to more accurately capture underlying comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One explanation for this increase in prevalence could be the relevance of these conditions at the time of surgery. In the month prior to mastectomy in this younger population, 64&#x000a0;% of the diagnoses coded on medical claims concerned the acute diagnosis (e.g., breast cancer, mammographic abnormality). Diagnoses of comorbid conditions may not have been considered relevant until the inpatient surgical admission, when hypertension, obesity, and smoking are important considerations in the administration of anesthesia and operative care. The inclusion of diagnoses from the mastectomy admission is justified for the comorbid conditions we chose to analyze since they are unlikely to arise during the mastectomy hospitalization.</p><p>There was a small but significant increase in the prevalence of hypertension and anemia when any two coded provider/outpatient facility claims were considered evidence for the condition, dropping the requirement for coding during encounters spaced at least 30&#x000a0;days apart. This may also be due to the younger mastectomy population we studied, in which healthcare encounters for workup and treatment are clustered during a relatively short time interval. We are unaware of any other studies that have assessed the spacing of outpatient claims. There was a large increase in prevalence of smoking and obesity when only one provider/outpatient facility claim was required to establish the diagnosis. The requirement of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 outpatient/provider claims to identify a condition was incorporated in comorbidity algorithms to account for inaccuracy in coding on outpatient claims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and the lack of specific codes for diagnostic workup. Since no testing is required to establish the diagnosis of obesity or smoking, we removed the requirement for coding during multiple encounters, resulting in an 88 and 70&#x000a0;% increase in the prevalence of obesity and smoking, respectively. The resulting increase put the calculated 12.65&#x000a0;% smoking prevalence in our privately insured population much closer to the 2007 national estimate of current smoking in non-elderly adult women of 17.63&#x000a0;%.</p><p>Finally, the addition of outpatient prescription claims significantly increased the calculated prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and in fact prescription claims identified more women with diabetes than medical claims. Medications have been used to identify chronic conditions alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], or in combination with diagnosis codes on medical claims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Adding medications to a medical claims algorithm improved identification of osteoporosis in a Canadian study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In contrast, prescription claims for smoking deterrents were uncommon and did not add to the prevalence estimate for smoking. Other investigators have used outpatient pharmacy data to estimate the prevalence of several chronic conditions, and found good agreement with health survey data for chronic conditions treated with specific agents, including diabetes and thyroid disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The estimated prevalence of chronic conditions based on prescription drug utilization was higher than national estimates based on survey data in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>We found that the calculated prevalence for diabetes and hypertension in the mastectomy population were higher than prevalence estimates for women aged 18&#x02013;64 years using the BRFSS and NHANES data. This could be due to the association of diabetes and hypertension with increased incidence of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our calculated prevalence of anemia, which included iron deficiency and other anemias, may be higher than the national estimate since the NHANES testing was limited to iron deficiency anemia. In addition, the prevalence of anemia may be higher in the mastectomy population since some women may have developed anemia secondary to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which could have been coded using a diagnosis code in our algorithm for &#x0201c;deficiency&#x0201d; anemia.</p><p>In contrast, our calculated prevalence of obesity was much lower than the estimated national prevalence of 26&#x000a0;% in non-elderly adult women, likely due to the low sensitivity (18&#x000a0;%) of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to identify obesity that we found in medical record review. The very low sensitivity and high PPV of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to identify obesity in our study has also been reported for ICD-10 codes in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our medical record validation we found that the median BMI for obese women with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for obesity was higher than the BMI of obese women who were not coded for obesity in the prior year, suggesting that morbid obesity is more likely to be coded than obesity per se. Supporting this is the similarity of the 6.31&#x000a0;% prevalence of coded obesity in our mastectomy population to the 8.29&#x000a0;% prevalence of morbid obesity in the NPCR Breast Cancer study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, the prevalence of smoking in the mastectomy population defined by one or more encounters coded for tobacco use disorder was 12.87&#x000a0;%, lower than the 2007 national estimate of 17.63&#x000a0;% from the BRFSS. Our lower prevalence may be due to the relatively low sensitivity (62.50&#x000a0;%) of coding for smoking we found compared to current smoking documented in the medical records. Coding of tobacco history or disorder had higher sensitivity to identify current smokers than ever smokers (62.50&#x000a0;% vs. 37.31&#x000a0;%, respectively), but the PPV was lower for current compared to ever-smoking. These results suggest that tobacco use coding has relatively high specificity, but may not distinguish between current and former smokers.</p><p>For all comorbid conditions other than anemia, the prevalence estimates were higher when 12 diagnosis code fields were available in the later time period of the database rather than 5 fields. The trends of increasing prevalence with sequential changes in our coding algorithm were the same in both time periods. The reason for the lower prevalence of anemia in the later years of the study (2009&#x02013;2011) may be due to the addition of a specific diagnosis code for antineoplastic chemotherapy-induced anemia in 2009, which is not included in the standard comorbidity category of anemia.</p><p>We found greatest improvement in our final algorithm in the younger third of the population compared with the older women in the cohort for diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. We hypothesized that comorbidities may not be captured as well among younger women with existing algorithms, owing to their different patterns of healthcare utilization compared to older women, which proved true for these three comorbid conditions. While improvements in capture of the five conditions we studied were evident in the older age groups as well (albeit to a lesser extent), particularly for anemia and smoking, these women in our cohort may be more similar to the older, sicker populations that were used to develop the traditional comorbidity algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have compared claims-based comorbidity measures or modifications based on improvement in ability to predict an outcome, rather than improved accuracy of condition identification. Most investigators have based improvement in comorbidity measures on improvement in model performance (e.g., concordance statistic) to predict mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], although other outcomes such as healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], readmissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and progression of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] have also been assessed. In contrast, we compared the prevalence of comorbidities calculated using claims data to health condition estimates in adult women of the same age reported in the BRFSS and NHANES survey populations. While we compared survey respondents with similar demographics to our population with respect to age, sex, and insurance status (BRFSS only), these national estimates may still not be completely comparable to the breast cancer population. The prevalence of a given comorbid condition in our commercially insured population may vary by other demographics that we could not account for, such as state of residence and type of insurance. In addition, the national estimates from the BRFSS survey are subject to limitations including self-report and recall bias.</p><p>We utilized a population of younger women undergoing mastectomy in order to assess modifications of a comorbidity algorithm in a non-elderly population. The patterns of healthcare utilization in our population of women, the majority of whom were newly diagnosed with breast cancer, may be different from other populations; therefore the generalizability of our findings is unknown. Future studies to determine if our findings hold in other non-elderly surgical and non-surgical populations, in men, and in patients with other types of health insurance are warranted. Men in particular have different patterns of healthcare utilization that may impact the performance of the algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found progressively increasing prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and anemia using claims data from a large population of non-elderly adult women undergoing mastectomy by altering the standard claims-based comorbidity algorithm to include diagnosis codes assigned during the surgical admission and removal of the requirement for spacing of diagnosis codes in outpatient encounters. Addition of outpatient pharmacy claims resulted in further increases in the calculated prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. We found progressively increasing prevalence of obesity and smoking by including diagnosis codes assigned during the surgical admission and by requiring only one coded inpatient or outpatient encounter, although medical record review to verify coding accuracy revealed low sensitivity of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to identify both health conditions. An important strength of our study is the large, longitudinal, population-based sample of younger persons representing hundreds of facilities from different geographic regions and different practice patterns. We assessed improvement in the coding algorithms compared to national survey estimates of the prevalence of the conditions in adult, non-elderly, insured women. Our results suggest a &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; approach to identifying comorbid conditions in claims data may not be the best way to identify individuals with a particular condition, and that investigators performing studies using claims data in younger, privately insured individuals may want to modify their strategy based on the particular comorbid conditions of interest. Additional research investigating strategies to optimize identification of comorbid health conditions in younger populations is needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12913_2016_1636_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Diagnosis Codes and Drug Categories Used to Identify Comorbidities and Prevalence ofComorbidities Among Women From 2004&#x02013;2008 vs. 2009&#x02013;2011.&#x000a0;(DOCX 15 kb)</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BRFSS</term><def><p>Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence Interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPT-4</term><def><p>Current Procedural Terminology, 4<sup>th</sup> edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCPCS</term><def><p>Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIRD<sup>SM</sup></term><def><p>HealthCore Integrated Research Database</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD-9-CM</term><def><p>International Classification of Diseases, 9<sup>th</sup> Revision, Clinical Modification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHANES</term><def><p>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPV</term><def><p>Negative Predictive Value</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPV</term><def><p>Positive Predictive Value</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UB-04</term><def><p>Uniform Billing Revenue</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank Cherie Hill for database and computer management support.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding for this project was provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (5R01CA149614 to MAO).
