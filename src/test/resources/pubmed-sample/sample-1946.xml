Amongst the most impacted are the elective medical and surgical services in order to conserve resources to care for COVID-19 patients. As the number of infected patients decrease across Canada, elective surgeries are being restarted in a staged manner. Since Otolaryngologists &#x02013; Head &#x00026; Neck Surgeons manage surgical diseases of the upper aerodigestive tract where the highest viral load reside, it is imperative that these surgeries resume in a safe manner. The aim of this document is to compile the current best evidence available and provide expert consensus on the safe restart of rhinologic and skull base surgeries while discussing the pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative care and tips. Risk assessment, patient selection, case triage, and pre-operative COVID-19 testing will be analyzed and discussed. These guidelines will also consider the optimal use of personal protective equipment for specific cases, general and specific operative room precautions, and practical tips of intra-operative maneuvers to optimize patient and provider safety. Given that the literature surrounding COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, these recommendations will serve to start our specialty back into elective rhinologic surgeries over the next months and they may change as we learn more about this disease.</p><p id="Par2">

A literature review of the current evidence regarding rhinologic surgery yielded several national position statements and recommendations. These were primarily composed of consensus expert opinion based on relatively small series as well as application from experiences with other similar diseases. The aim of this document is to summarize the current evidence and provide expert consensus recommendations surrounding the pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative care for rhinology and skull base patients in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. As well, these recommendations endeavour to provide general principles ranging from triaging of cases, pre-operative COVID-19 screening, personal protection equipment (PPE) use to general and specific precautions in the operating room as well as practical tips of intra-operative maneuvers to optimize patient and provider safety while providing a high level of patient care.</p><p id="Par17">The literature surrounding COVID-19 is evolving rapidly. These recommendations will serve as a &#x0201c;starter&#x0201d; document to get our specialty back into elective rhinologic surgery over the next weeks to months. As the epidemiology of the disease changes, these recommendations may change. This text represents a living document that will be updated over time.

If substantial changes in clinical information arise, this taskforce will endeavour to keep this information updated periodically.</p><p id="Par18">The guidelines and recommendations of each applicable regional health authority should be respected and checked regularly for updates. The information in this document is meant to be an adjunct to local recommendations, but not to supersede them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Timing of surgery and prioritization</title><p id="Par19">There are currently no evidence-based recommendations for rhinologic surgical prioritization other than the French [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], American [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and European [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] expert opinion guidelines. Depending on the rate of community spread, local infection and control measures, and availability of resources, it is recommended that previously scheduled cases be deferred until local circumstances allow for a return to more normal clinical activities. Consideration for urgent and emergent pathologies are outlined below and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Patient factors such as COVID-19 positivity status, age, and associated comorbidities should also be taken into account when triaging these cases. For COVID-19 positive patients, we recommend those with emergent surgeries proceed with necessary PPE; urgent and semi-urgent surgeries may be delayed for a short time if feasible; and expedited and standard surgeries be delayed until the infection clears and the patient&#x02019;s COVID-19 status is negative. The definition of a cleared COVID-19 infection may differ between health jurisdictions and regional health authority guidance should be followed (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Symptomatic and known exposed patients who are asymptomatic should get tested for COVID-19 pre-procedure, and the procedure should optimally be postponed until 1) the test result is back, 2) a patient with significant exposure is no longer in self-isolation, and/or 3) symptoms have resolved. While the benefit of testing symptomatic patients is clear, the potential benefit of asymptomatic testing in the non-exposed and asymptomatic population is more controversial, and heavily depends on the local epidemiology and individual preferences of surgeons and patients.</p><p id="Par21">Pre-operative COVID-19 testing has been highlighted as one of the important and necessary components of elective surgical reopening in a joint statement from the American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses and American Hospital Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, given issues with accessibility to tests, administrative challenges and limitations of locoregional laboratories, it is important to consider why pre-operative testing may be considered. The first consideration is whether a positive test would lead to a change in management. Changes in management can be: a) postponing the case if tested positive for either health care provider (HCP) or patient safety, or b) impact on the choice of PPE.</p><p id="Par22">From a patient safety perspective, patients with a COVID-19 infection appear to have an increased risk of mortality following elective surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In one study from Wuhan, the rate of ICU admission following elective surgery in asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients was 44.1%, and the mortality rate was 20.5%, which was higher than the expected morbidity and mortality following these surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Significance of pre-operative COVID-19 testing is further highlighted by the high incidence of 30-day mortality of 38% in patients with peri-operative COVID-19 infection in an international study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it remains unclear to what extent COVID-19 contributed to this higher than expected mortality rate given that the 7-day post-operative mortality was much lower, and to what extent the mortality could have been reduced by not operating on these patients. It also remains unclear to what extent these findings are generalizable to the surgical procedures discussed in this document as the vast majority of procedures were orthopedic and general surgical procedures, in regions with a high local prevalence of COVID-19.</p><p id="Par23">Missing COVID-19 positives in screening that are infectious can result in harm to HCPs. COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory virus. During the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in the early 2000s, aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) were associated with an increased risk of viral transmission to HCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the case of SARS CoV-2, the nasal and oral cavities have an especially high viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many otolaryngologic surgeries involve manipulation of the upper aerodigestive tract, with an unknown risk of aerosol generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While the appropriate PPE for operating in COVID-19 positive patients has been debated, many sources have advocated for a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) when surgery is necessary in COVID-19 positive patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this level of PPE is often unavailable within Canada, and requires training for safe donning and doffing. Similarly, in the post-operative phase, COVID-19 positive patients generate an increased risk of transmission to HCPs involved in their care, as well as other patients in the hospital.</p><p id="Par24">This risk relates to asymptomatic individuals who screen negative for symptoms and exposures, but are pre-symptomatic within 48&#x02009;h of onset of symptoms or currently asymptomatic carriers during the infectious period. These patients can be identified by pre-operative COVID-19 testing. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections may contribute to a significant proportion of infections. Approximately 17% of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was made up of asymptomatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Iceland, 50% of COVID-19 infections were asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Within Canada, a voluntary study in Calgary, AB screened asymptomatic participants and identified COVID-19 infections in 17.5% of the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These studies emphasize that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients exist and are relatively common. In New York, asymptomatic testing during the peak of the pandemic for obstetrical patients discovered 14% of patients presenting for delivery were COVID-19 positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A study examining universal pre-operative testing in Alabama found 1% of patients scheduled for surgery tested positive for COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While the rates of asymptomatic carriers vary significantly, likely related to local disease prevalence, asymptomatic but infectious individuals can be an important source of transmission. But it is also important to emphasize that a positive test does not equate infectivity (see Section 3.2).</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Types of COVID-19 tests</title><p id="Par25">As of June 7, 2020, there are twenty-two COVID-19 tests approved for use in Canada, with an additional thirty-three under review by Health Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Of the approved tests, 20 are lab-based tests, one is a point of care test approved for research only and one is both a point of care and lab-based test. Nineteen are nucleic acid technology based, utilizing reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 3 are serologic tests for immunoglobulins.</p><p id="Par26">The RT-PCR tests are the predominant form of testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at this time. These are typically meant to be performed on specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs, though oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, endotracheal specimens, and bronchoalveolar lavage samples can be used in some tests as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The current Center for Disease Control (CDC) approved test amplifies two separate genome regions. Where both regions are found, the test is positive. Where only one is found, the result is inconclusive, and where neither are present, then the test is negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The other set of tests that are emerging are the serological tests, which test for immunoglobulins, primarily IgM and IgG. These tests currently have no significant role in testing for active disease, and rather look for evidence of previous infection and immunity. Over time, serological testing will provide a better retrospective assessment of the true extent of the pandemic to date within Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interpreting COVID-19 test results</title><p id="Par28">RT-PCR has a specificity rate typically estimated to be in the range of 99&#x02013;100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A high specificity means that a positive test can be generally considered a true positive in the context of a symptomatic patient in a community where COVID-19 is epidemic. The same would largely apply to an asymptomatic patient from a region with not-low prevalence of COVID-19, and especially during a local wave of infections. However, in an asymptomatic patient in a community with a low prevalence, the pre-test probability would be lower than the false-positive rate (1:100 to 1:1000 based on assumed specificity of 99&#x02013;99.9%), as such there is a risk of finding multiple false-positives until one true-positive case can be identified. Furthermore, even a true-positive finding does not necessarily imply that a patient is infectious: it has been shown that infectivity declines significantly after onset of symptoms until day 8 in uncomplicated cases and that patients are less likely to be infectious thereafter; this is likely felt to be similar in asymptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, a positive result can either be a pre-symptomatic or active/infectious asymptomatic carrier, a previously infectious but still PCR-positive individual, or a false-positive result. The latter two are responsible for the majority of positive results in a low prevalence setting, while the epidemiologic relevant/infectious cases are more likely the majority in a higher prevalence setting.</p><p id="Par29">The sensitivity, quoted to be as low as 70% in the early stages of the pandemic based on studies from China, is reported to be as high 97% (92&#x02013;100%) for nasopharyngeal swabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The viral testing sensitivity may also vary by assay and as such by laboratory to which the specimens are sent. Hence, key is to identify new and changing symptoms as part of the screening process as outlined above, and if there is still a doubt after one negative test, one can consider postponing the procedure, or to-retest the patient. When pre-operative testing identifies an asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patient in the setting of a reasonable high pre-test probability, surgery should be postponed if possible. The CDC has recommended these patients should be quarantined for a minimum of 7&#x02009;days and be asymptomatic with two negative RT-PCR results performed 24&#x02009;h apart to confirm clearance of SARS-CoV-2 before the surgery is rescheduled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, many Canadian jurisdictions have moved to a symptom-based clearance 14&#x02009;days after onset of symptoms or positive test in asymptomatics. The main reason is the evidence that patients are no longer considered infectious after 14&#x02009;days, and the fact that the PCR can remain positive for weeks or even months without implying infectivity.</p><p id="Par30">The limitations are further compounded by the fact that the specificity and in particular sensitivity of the COVID-19 RT-PCR test in asymptomatic patients is less clear. This being said, the local prevalence of COVID-19 cases will substantially affect test interpretation based on pre-test probability, but also the surgical work. Regions with a low case prevalence will be in a different category, and should be more able to perform routine surgical work than regions with a high case prevalence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Who should receive pre-operative COVID-19 testing</title><p id="Par31">Given the significant consequences of an unidentified COVID-19 positive patient undergoing operative care, universal pre-operative testing is recommended by many experts at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This approach has been implemented in the majority of centres in North America during peak COVID-19 activity, and is recommended in the joint statement referenced above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This is particularly important in patients undergoing otolaryngologic surgery, which may represent an additional risk to the OR staff. While the risk of aerosolization during upper aerodigestive surgery is unclear, and whether this potential aerosolization presents a significant risk to HCPs is also unclear, at this time one of the easiest ways to mitigate these concerns is to test patients pre-operatively in a non-low prevalence setting. With low and very low prevalence of COVID-19, the potential benefit can be outweighed by the potential harm of testing: false positives and non-infectious patients who are not infectious having to comply with quarantine, having their procedures unnecessarily delayed, patient thinking they have an active infection resulting in distress and unnecessary anxiety, as well as administrative inconveniences. With this in mind, surgeons and institutions must risk stratify and balance the pros and cons of pre-operative testing based on local epidemiology and the type and risk associated with surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Optimal pre-operative testing</title><p id="Par32">Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of recommendations produced by otolaryngology and rhinology communities worldwide. Uniformly, the recommendations include a thorough and comprehensive pre-operative COVID-19 symptom and risk factor questionnaire (e.g. one from Ontario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), and as well as at least a single COVID-19 test, typically a nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR which has repeatedly been shown to have the highest sensitivity. Several groups have recommended an addition of chest imaging, such a chest x-ray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] or CT chest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A study from Wuhan looking at correlation between chest CT and RT-PCR found chest CT to be more sensitive in detecting COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Others have recommended employing two RT-PCR testing in sequence, several days apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Finally, some have advocated for two RT-PCR tests, followed by chest imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Given the more recent data, the sensitivity of NPS testing is much higher than originally reported, and given that the CT and chest x-ray findings are nonspecific, a single pre-operative NPS seems reasonable for asymptomatic patients who require testing. There is also a paucity of evidence to advocate for a more resource intensive protocol that included a CT scan or chest x-ray as recommended in some guidelines. The test is unable to identify a patient who is incubating the infection with minimal viral replication at the time of the test. Therefore, in an optimal setting, patients would receive the pre-operative nasopharyngeal swabs for the RT-PCR test 24(&#x02212;&#x02009;48) hours prior to surgery to limit the window of time during which the patient may be pre-symptomatic but not tested.</p><p id="Par33">There have been many concerns about whether there are &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; otolaryngology surgeries which may warrant more comprehensive testing. Currently, there is no literature available to guide whether some surgeries require more testing than others. Recent publications suggest that surgeries involving drilling generate a significant amount of aerosols compared to surgeries without a drill. Surgeries involving lasers in the aerodigestive tract have a known risk of aerosol generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and cautery may result in aerosolization into the surgical plume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. With the understanding that the respiratory mucosa harbours high levels of COVID-19 in infected individuals, this may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission in these patients. However, there is not a clear, definitive path to recommend additional testing in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Special considerations</title><p id="Par34">There are many additional factors that should be considered when assessing the need and practicality of pre-operative testing. Many health regions within Canada face logistical issues that affect the timeliness of the RT-PCR results. For example, most testing sites are not at the same location as the lab that performs the test. This necessitates pick up and delivery of the swabs from the testing site to the lab, which often means the lab will not receive the specimen until the day after it was performed. The RT-PCR test itself takes upwards of 6&#x02009;h to be performed, not including the set up time or the interpretation time. The test also requires the appropriate reagents to be available, which were in short supply at the beginning of the pandemic. While turn-around times vary from region to region, the fastest test results are typically available in approximately 8&#x02009;h. In areas where there is increased testing or increased travel times from testing sites to labs, additional time to receive results is required. It is important for the ordering physician to be familiar with the current wait times of the COVID-19 assay in their region, and request patients be tested as close to the procedure date as possible.</p><p id="Par35">The testing of pediatric patients is another area for consideration. One must acknowledge that testing can be challenging in the pediatric population. Children are unsurprisingly the least compliant population with nasopharyngeal testing. It is still unclear whether children are more likely to remain entirely asymptomatic than adults, but clearly, paediatric patients are far less likely to develop severe infections. Hence, many children exhibit non-specific, albeit COVID-like symptoms at baseline, such as rhinorrhea. Careful screening for any even quite minor symptoms can help guide clinicians on the safety of proceeding with surgery in light of these considerations.</p><p id="Par36">Further considerations in the pre- and post-operative period may include COVID-19 testing methodology. As rhinology patients may have intranasal pathology including crusting/infection, tumour, stents and skull base defects, they may be inappropriate subjects for nasal/nasopharyngeal swab testing. As such, alternate diagnostic strategies including sputum or oropharyngeal testing should be considered and discussed on a case-by-case basis in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is important, however, to consider the lower sensitivity of such testing.</p><p id="Par37">A final consideration is whether to have patients isolate pre-operatively. In the early stages of surgical reopening, strict pre-operative quarantine of the patient and their household was implemented to varying degrees throughout Canada. As the case volume of COVID-19 has decreased, strict quarantine was reduced to isolation, then reduced to physical distancing and now in some regions, no pre-operative isolation is required. While the reason for pre-operative isolation is intuitive to many (to avoid exposure to the virus and provide a self monitoring period for symptoms), this comes at a great economic burden to most patients. It is preferable for patients to adhere to strict physical distancing, at the very least, as they await their surgery. Otherwise, pre-operative isolation should be determined by individual health regions based on their current caseload and degree of community spread, among other factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>COVID-19 pre-operative testing recommendation</title><p id="Par38">

This is particularly important in those undergoing potentially high-risk AGMPs, such as rhinologic procedures. Still there will be some asymptomatic patients, who are asymptomatic and may falsely test negative, or were incubating when the specimen was obtained, and are unknowingly brought to the operating room. The frequency of this occurrence heavily depends on the local epidemiology as outlined above. Understanding that this may occur, systematic alterations that can be made in the operating suite, including configuration and room pressurization, as well as pre-operative medication strategies that may be employed in rhinology patients to minimize potential disease transmission.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Operative suite configuration and negative pressure rooms</title><p id="Par46">The single most important measure to reduce the risk of transmission to personnel in the ORs is minimizing the amount of personnel in the operating theater (particularly during AGMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and ensuring that the amount of thoroughfare is minimized during AGMPs, to reduce the potential risk of escape of bioaerosols into the surrounding areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Airflow principles in the operating room have become an important topic in minimizing risk of COVID-19 and any other respiratory pathogens to the operating room personnel. The majority of the operating rooms in Canada are considered &#x02018;positive pressure&#x02019; relative to the surrounding hallways and corridors. The advantage of positive pressure is a purported reduction in surgical site infections (SSI), as the air is continuously pushed &#x02018;out&#x02019; into the hallway, to prevent pathogens in the surrounding hallways from entering the operating theatre. Conversely, a &#x02018;negative pressure&#x02019; room denotes a theatre for which air is continuously drawn into the room from the surrounding hallways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The advantage of a negative pressure room is that, in a patient who may contaminate the room with infectious aerosols, there is less escape and dispersion of the aerosols to the rest of the surrounding hallways and rooms. This is felt to help prevent spread of pathogens beyond the operating theatre. The risk within the theatre, however, is only affected by the number of air cycles per hour regardless of whether the relative pressure is positive or negative. Other potential strategies to minimize aerosol dispersion risk are ensuring rooms have a high rate of air exchange, whether positive or negative pressure, and/or the use of portable High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters within positive pressure rooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">The evidence regarding air pressurization in COVID-19 is limited. Many of these protocols are drawn from similar prior outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), as well as other pathogens like tuberculosis (TB). The majority of the guidelines support the use of negative pressure rooms. The ENT UK Epistaxis guidelines, The Italian Skull Base Society, and the International Head and Neck Scientific Group have all published on the recommendation for negative pressure operating theatres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Couloigner et al. have recommended against negative pressure rooms in their article about COVID-19 and ENT surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. There are two main drawbacks to a negative pressure room. First, many hospitals do not have access to many, if any, negative pressure operating rooms, and as such it is not realistic to do all elective potentially aerosol generating surgeries in this setting. Secondly, theoretically the negative pressure room increases surgical site infections (SSI) by drawing pathogens into the operating theatre from the surrounding areas. However, in the head and neck, SSI from bacterial airborne contamination are very rare due in large part to the robust vascular supply.</p><p id="Par50">Beyond the pressure settings in the operating room, there are other considerations that must be taken into account in order to optimize patient flow. In March 2020, Ti et al. described their operative suite setup of a negative pressure room for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

A HEPA filter can be used to reduce the risk if no negative-pressure OR is available for these patients. Negative-pressure ORs are not required or do not need prioritization for screen negative patients (with or without testing). Regardless of the direction of the pressure, the frequency of air exchanges in the OR should be maximized. Furthermore, the use of strategies to create a local negative pressure environment within the nose (see section 6.3 and 6.4) or in close proximity to the patient (for example via the use of portable HEPA filter units, or smoke evacuation tubing) may be beneficial.</p><p id="Par52">It should be noted that these recommendations are based largely on consensus statement and expert opinion, and not on firm, experimental data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Pre-operative preparation for Rhinologic procedures</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Pre-operative medications</title><p id="Par53">Pre-operative systemic antibiotics and/or systemic steroids are frequently prescribed for rhinology patients to control underlying inflammation and to improve surgical visualization and outcomes.</p><p id="Par54">International consensus guidelines suggest that pre-operative antibiotics are useful when a chronic rhinosinusitis patient&#x02019;s clinical presentation indicates a potential for increased bleeding and longer surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Minimizing proximity to the patient&#x02019;s face during the procedure is recommended and may be improved with use of video endoscopy tower systems if available. In cases of localized anterior epistaxis, particularly in Little&#x02019;s area, a decongestant or a use of vasoconstrictor topical medication on a pledget or sponge can be used to temporize the bleeding. Avoiding (especially powered) nebulized medications to decrease theoretical risk of aerosolization of nasal secretions may be beneficial. Silver nitrate, as opposed to electrocautery is ideal to minimize cautery plume. If possible, keep a suction close to patient&#x02019;s nare to minimize aerosol spread and capture any blood or viral particles. This can be done by the patient holding the suction device such as a Yankauer near their nose or with the help of an assistant. If packing is required, it would be ideal to use dissolvable packing to eliminate the similar risks of packing removal at the next encounter. For non-dissolvable packing options, avoid ribbon gauge packs as they are more tedious and time consuming to complete, instead, if appropriate, consider a simple lubricated Merocel(&#x02122;) or Rapid Rhino(&#x02122;) nasal pack which requires a simple one push technique and easier to remove in the subsequent visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Posterior epistaxis</title><p id="Par100">Similar strategies to anterior epistaxis should be considered to minimize risk of aerosolization and transmission of blood-born and respiratory pathogens.

If a patient requires surgical exploration, consider surgical clips for sphenopalatine ligation over cauterization if the patient is COVID-19 positive. Otherwise, a point of care risk assessment can be performed to determine which approach is best in the surgeon&#x02019;s experience. If cautery is utilized, use suctioning in the contralateral nostril when cautery is used. Furthermore, it would be prudent to consider bipolar cautery over monopolar as it limits the area of thermal injury and decreases risk of unnecessary aerosolization from normal nasal tissue.

The indication and the risk/benefit ratio of the technique for turbinate reduction should be weighed against the potential for aerosol generation in each individual patient. During any potential aerosol-generating procedure, a suction should be used in the contralateral nare placed in the nasopharynx. Prior to any surgical procedures of turbinates, a vasoconstrictor applied topically such as epinephrine or oxymetazoline on pledgets and injecting the turbinate with local anesthetic should be considered to decrease risk of bleeding during the procedure. Radiofrequency technique may provide the least risk of aerosolization and thermal injury to surrounding tissue. Performing the reduction in the OR under general anesthetic allows for control of the patient&#x02019;s airway and will limit the potential for patient sneezing and bleeding. We suggest not using any post procedure stents or packing which may be needed to be removed in the post-operative visit (see Section 6.1).

The addition of concurrent suction use while drilling eliminated the contamination. Running a contaminated drill outside the nasal cavity resulted in gross droplet spread, as expected, indicating that the soft tissue confines of the nasal cavities function as a barrier in preventing droplet splatter.

If possible, the microdebrider insertion and removal from nasal cavities should be minimized. The use of an irrigation sleeve to help with visualization will help to minimize moving scope in and out of the nasal cavity as well.

The area at home where patients perform their nasal irrigation will need to be disinfected after use if being used by other household members. Similarly, other household members should utilize contact/droplet precautions or avoid the area while irrigation is underway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Skull Base surgery</title><sec id="Sec42"><title>Background</title><p id="Par107">CoVID-19 emerged in early 2020 as a global pandemic and with it came significant concern and recommendations to help guide surgical practice in the field of endoscopic skull base surgery. Early opinions were based on limited evidence and anecdotal reporting of transmission of disease amongst HCPs. A clear understanding of the facts surrounding the early cases is important as we try to emerge from a near complete global shut down of endoscopic skull base surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>How did we get Here?</title><p id="Par108">In their original letter to the Editor in Neurosurgery, Patel et al. summarized the evidence they had gathered with respect to COVID-19 and its effects on OR personnel in Wuhan, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. They stated that more than 14 members of the patient care team both within and outside the operating room became infected with COVID-19 after a trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS) in early January in Wuhan on a patient with mild flu-like symptoms. In addition, a second TSS later in January on a patient with pituitary apoplexy and fever with imaging changes to suggest viral pneumonia was operated on with &#x0201c;appropriate&#x0201d; PPE. During this second case the neurosurgeon and 2 OR nurses wore N95 respirators and the anesthesiologist wore a homemade positive pressure helmet. Within 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;days, the surgeon and the 2 OR nurses developed fever and respiratory symptoms compatible with pneumonia. However, no confirmed COVID-19 positive testing was reported. The anesthesiologist did not develop any symptoms and the others all fully recovered.</p><p id="Par109">The group from Stanford also commented on personal communications with Otolaryngologists in Iran and stated that at least 20 Otolaryngologists were hospitalized (COVID-19 swab positive) and 20 more were at home in isolation with no swab results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. Media reports from the United Kingdom stated that the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology confirmed 2 consultants were COVID-19 positive and on ventilatory support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Understandably, these very concerning reports led to significant anxiety in the skull base community and quickly, most non-life-threatening endoscopic skull base surgery was halted globally.</p><p id="Par110">The neurosurgical group from Wuhan formulated a rebuttal to clarify the facts surrounding the sentinel case that was being discussed widely in several surgical societies and forums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. They stated that one patient underwent TSS on Jan 6th and was diagnosed with COVID-19 13&#x02009;days later. Notably, none of the medical staff who participated in the surgery were infected with COVID-19. There were 10 nurses and 4 surgeons who were infected and only 4 nurses had direct patient contact with this individual. It was presumed they all became infected during post-operative care as the patient was transferred between 3 different hospital wards after surgery. In addition, they have no data to support the story on the second case of fever and respiratory symptoms in OR personnel wearing appropriate PPE within the neurosurgery group in Wuhan.</p><p id="Par111">To the best of our knowledge after a review of the literature there are no other reports of intraoperative spread of COVID-19 in personnel wearing appropriate PPE following endoscopic skull base surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Experimental evidence of high-speed instruments</title><p id="Par112">The literature is rapidly evolving and currently contains 3 objective cadaveric studies exploring droplet and aerosol generation in transnasal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Their collective findings suggest that limited droplet spread could occur during microdebrider use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], and aerosolization occurs with use of electrocautery and a high-speed drill. However, they also describe a lack of aerosol formation with nasal suctioning, cold surgical instrumentation such as cutting forceps, as well as with the microdebrider, due to a relatively low speed of rotation, and aspiration through its large-bore suction (assuming the suction remain unplugged) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The obvious weakness of these cadaver studies is that they do not assess viral load/content and infectious transmissibility (Also see Section 6.3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Similarities to other aerosol generating procedures in the head and neck region</title><p id="Par113">The early response to concerns about aerosol generation during skull base surgery and possible increased risk of infectivity, in addition to systematic down-scaling of OR activity, has led to a large reduction of performance of skull base surgery. Knowledge about infection prevention and risk mitigation can be gained from within the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery specialty community and from other specialties who perform procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract. Many regional authorities, including Public Health Ontario, have defined aerosol generating procedures to include tracheostomy, surgical procedures with high-speed instrumentation in the aerodigestive tract, and dental procedures requiring high speed drilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Parallels can be drawn from these areas.</p><p id="Par114">Early studies have suggested that the lower respiratory tract and not the upper respiratory tract may have the highest viral loads of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that tracheal or bronchial surgery may be higher risk than procedures of the upper respiratory tract and skull base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Guidance issued for performance of tracheostomy procedures in COVID-19 positive patients suggests the need for negative pressure rooms or in the absence of negative pressure rooms, consideration for high efficiency particulate air filtration (HEPA) air filtration systems as an alternative. Recommendations for protective equipment include the use of PAPRs in addition to fluid repellent disposable gowns, eye protection, and gloves in presumed or known COVID-19 positive patients. As an alternative in the absence of PAPR&#x02019;s, at a minimum the use of fit-tested N95 or FFP3 masks in addition to the aforementioned measures. In the COVID negative patient, the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology task force on performance of tracheostomy has suggested performance by the most experienced person, the use of N95, and full facial and neck protection, and either 1 or 2 pre-operative tests given the uncertain false negative rate of the test at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. The same group recommended use of PAPR in patients who have unknown or presumed COVID-19 positive status to mitigate risk understanding that not all centres have access to this level of protective equipment.</p><p id="Par115">Although it is not entirely clear which procedures are the highest risk for aerosolization of viral particles, previous studies have shown that electrocautery, drilling, ultrasonic devices such as the harmonic scalpel, and suction irrigation may cause aerosolization of viral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. These types of surgical instrumentation are not unique to skull base surgery and are used in head and neck cancer procedures, otologic procedures, as well as dental procedures.</p><p id="Par116">For management of head and neck cancers, because of the importance of time-sensitive surgery to avoid adverse outcomes such as stage migration and inoperability, there have been relatively fewer reductions in surgical volumes compared to other surgical subspecialties. Recommendations have been variable but include pre-operative testing (in some cases two pre-operative tests or the addition of chest imaging to minimize false negative tests), use of full protective equipment including disposable gowns and caps, N95 respirators and face shields, and preference for the use of negative pressure ORs where possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Some groups have recommended use of PAPRs as a preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Creation of barriers to prevent aerosolization of mucosal surfaces has similarly been recommended where possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Early recommendations from an expert panel suggested that in COVID-19 positive patients requiring urgent surgery, consideration should be given to use of PAPR or at least a single-use N95 respirator with face-shield and/or goggles, gown, and double gloves, while in patients who are COVID-19 negative or low risk, practitioners should consider N95 respirator and eye protection, or if unavailable surgical mask with goggles or face shield, gown, and double gloves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>].</p><p id="Par117">The Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Canada have recently issued guidance for our dental colleagues, who perform similar procedures with powered instrumentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. This advisory body has suggested screening of all patients with routine questions, but does not specifically require COVID-19 testing prior to performance of AGMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Based on this screening process, patients are classified as screen positive or negative. For patients screening positive and who are undergoing AGMPs, recommendations for use of PPE include use of fit-tested N95 respirator, gloves, eye protection and face shield and protective gowns. For patients who screen negative and are undergoing AGMPs, use of N95 or surgical mask in addition to gloves, eye protection and/or face shield, and a protective gown has been recommended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Neurotropism of COVID-19</title><p id="Par118">As mentioned above, SARS-Cov-2 is found in high density in nasal and nasopharyngeal tissue.

Other measures mentioned above such as prepping the operative field including the nasal cavity with (0.5%) Povidone-Iodine are generalizable to expanded endonasal skull base approaches (see Section 4.2.2).</p><sec id="FPar4"><title>Creating a negative pressure zone within the Nasopharynx</title><p id="Par121">As mentioned previously, due to the frequent use of powered instrumentation and electrocautery which may be difficult to avoid, the creation of an aerosol/droplet plume during more advanced endoscopic skull base procedures is a potential significant risk to the surgical team members. One option used by some of the members of the task force has been to direct the airflow away from the nostrils. This may be accomplished through the use of dynamic suctioning while drilling or cauterizing. As well, the use of a flexible endotracheal suction catheter inserted either via the non-dominant nostril, under the inferior turbinate or trans-orally to constantly suction air and fluid throughout the entire surgery is a recommended option. This serves to orient the airflow posteriorly to the nasopharynx and serves to minimize the risk of bioaerosol exiting through the nostrils (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Technical nuances include having the suction secured with a stapler to the drapes so that it rests approximately 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;mm from the back of the nasopharynx. The suction should be checked periodically to ensure it is not obstructed with clot or debris. If a naso-septal flap is required, it may be best to tuck it into a maxillary sinus so it does not obstruct the suction catheter in the nasopharynx.

Droplets were identified at the tip of the smoke evacuator in cases with prolonged high-speed drilling, leading the authors to hypothesize that this apparatus may effectively capture fluid in the form of droplets or aerosols. Utilization of these types of methods may complicate the facility of introduction and freedom of movement of surgical instruments into the operative field.</p><p id="Par125">Common sense interventions such as minimizing surgical time and bleeding are also recommended especially in high risk patients and communities.

Light packing of the sphenoid sinus or nasal cavity using fully dissolvable materials such as gelfoam, oxycellulose, or starch-based packings should be considered at the conclusion of surgery. Patients should irrigate their nasal cavities with a sterile pressurized saline spray 3&#x02013;6 times a day for the initial post-operative period; this may be required beyond a month if no debridement is performed in the office or clinic.</p><p id="Par127">Although some sources have advocated for the shift of extended endonasal approaches to intracranial corridors (e.g. pituitary pathology, CSF leak repair), we believe that in the considerable majority of cases, this may not be prudent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>].

The use of pledgets for topical anesthesia and decongestion locally is preferred over powered atomizers, however manual spray is considered safe. Local anesthesia should be injected as per usual procedure. There is some evidence for the use of Povidone prep pre-operatively (see Section 4.0). The use of Ativan 1&#x02009;mg sedation can be considered to help keep the patient calm. Tranexamic acid (IV, oral, or topical) can be used to decrease risk of bleeding post-operatively.
