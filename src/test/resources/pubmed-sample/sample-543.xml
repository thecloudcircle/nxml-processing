A number of Abs administrated to human/animals are partially metabolized in the digestive track and discharged in the hospital/communal effluents, which end up in environmental water bodies, either treated/untreated [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) from human/animal sources, along with excessive use of Abs in the human, veterinary and agricultural settings are currently considered as a serious environmental problem [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a growing global public threat with serious health, political and economic implications. New forms of AR could spread with ease across international boundaries and between continents [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the environment the increased dissemination of ARB is possibly caused by mechanisms involving horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, selective pressure induced by various contaminants (Abs, metals, biocides) in the environment, gene mutation and recombination [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In recent years, research studies outside the clinical settings on AR have begun to receive attention. Understanding the diversity patterns of antibiotic resistance genes and biological role of AR mechanisms will help to control its threats to human/animal health [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In many parts of the globe freshwater resources polluted by microbial contaminants is still a major problem [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp., (ENT)) residing in the gastrointestinal tract of warm blooded animals are generally used to monitor the microbial quality of water sources. Additionally, polluted surface waters and sediments can contain a variety of pathogenic microbes including bacteria, viruses and protozoa [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The choice of bacterial indicators is thus very important. Bacteria belonging to the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus are extensively present in the environment, such as water soil and sediment. Being known for its innate resistance mechanisms, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. are capable of staying viable in the aquatic environment for long periods [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which carries the hazard of spreading ARGs and mobile genetic elements and can cause infections in humans [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Sediments may contain 100&#x02013;1000 fold higher bacterial counts than the overlying water [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Estimation of microbial contaminants in sediments serves as a stable index for long-term water quality risks [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, sediments provide us with the opportunity to address the persistence of microbial contaminants/ARGs and the potential impact of the emergence of resistant bacteria from wastewaters and its transfer to the freshwater microbial community.</p><p>Effluents from hospital, industrial waste, domestic sewage, and urban/agricultural runoff in developing countries represent a significant source of emerging contaminants (metals, ARGs, ARB) for the receiving environment as the effluents are discharged to the sewer systems, rivers, lakes, and seas without prior treatment, which then may accumulate in the sediments [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Rivers and lakes are considered as putative reservoirs of emerging contaminants (drugs, metals, ARGs), since they collect wastewaters containing various contaminants from different origins [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies investigating rivers as a potential reservoirs of ARGs are still very limited in tropical areas, including South India [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, a few of such studies have reported the prevalence of clinically relevant ARGs in environmental samples from North India [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The presence of emerging pollutants such as ARB/ARGs, metals in wastewaters and their dissemination to the environmental compartment have become a topics of scientific interest over the last few decades [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In developing countries (under tropical conditions). A few studies [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported on the physical-chemical characteristics of sediments receiving untreated hospital and urban effluent waters, however, little information is available on the development of microbial contaminants in receiving water systems. Hence there is a paucity of information regarding the microbial water quality in the tropics tropical rivers as well as about the prevalence of clinically relevant ARGs resulting from untreated urban and hospital effluents. The aim of the research presented in this study is to assess the role of untreated hospital and urban wastewaters on the accumulation of microbial contaminants in the sediment of receiving systems in the Cauvery River Basin, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. This assessment was based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on ARGs (<italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>SHV</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub> and <italic>aadA</italic>), total bacterial load, and selected bacterial marker genes FIB and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. ARGs selected for this study were based on the following criteria: (i) clinically relevant genes (human risk); (ii) genes conferring resistance to frequently used Abs (eg: penicillins and aminoglycosides) and newer extended-spectrum &#x000df;-lactams (carbapenems and cephalosporins); (iii) ARGs previously reported in mobile genetic elements; and (iv) prevalence of metallo-&#x000df;-lactamases (<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub>) in South India [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This research presents useful tools for the evaluation of emerging microbial contaminants in tropical aquatic ecosystems which can be applied in similar environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area and sample collection</title><p>This study was carried out in the Cauvery River Basin (Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India) [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cauvery River, located in the southern part of the Indian sub-continent is estimated to cover a drainage area of 81,555 km<sup>2</sup>, with many tributaries generally flowing to the south and east of the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The river flows between 75&#x000b0;27' to 79&#x000b0;54' east longitude and 10&#x000b0;9' to 13&#x000b0;30' north latitude. From Coorg in the Western Ghats to the river mouth at the Bay of Bengal, the river flows through a densely populated area. The climate is tropical and its main tributaries include Hemavati, Kabini, Bhavani and Amaravati. Cauvery River is primarily supplied by monsoon rains, and the discharge of this rain-fed river fluctuates seasonally. Cauvery River water is mostly used for irrigation, household consumption and the generation of electricity. The river, during its course, receives a substantial amount of industrial effluents, untreated municipal sewage, urban runoff and agricultural runoff [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149211.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Located in the central part of Tamil Nadu, at a latitude of 10&#x000b0;10' and 11&#x000b0;20' north and a longitude of 78&#x000b0;10' and 29&#x000b0;0' east Tiruchirappalli has a tropical climate with ca. 0.75 million inhabitants as of 2001 and the recent estimates measures to be ca. 1 million. The city generates an average of 68 million liters day<sup>-1</sup> of wastewater and collects 42 million liters day<sup>-1</sup> in its existing sewage system with the end point being the nearby water sources (Cauvery River) after a partial treatment. At Tiruchirappalli, large industries (steel plants, distilleries and chemical factories, leather tanning and pesticides production) discharge their wastewaters to Uyakkondan canal. This irrigation canal serves as a major source of water for more than 32,000 acres of agricultural land, 36 tanks, and also serves as the major conduit for receiving the effluent waters from large industries. The sampling locations and the collection points for our study are identical to a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hence the sampling site E1 (effluent discharge point) is free from wastewater from large industries, but does receive wastewater from domestic sources, hospitals and small-scale industries [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, the surface sediments (n = 45) were collected from: (1) five selected hospital outlet pipes (HOP), before being released into the municipal sewers, for a period of 4 months (June to September), during 2 calendar years (2012 and 2013) and (2) in the Cauvery River Basin (CRB),Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. The surface sediments (2&#x02013;6 cm) in the CRB were collected at 5 specific points labelled as R0&#x02013;5 km upstream of the effluent discharge point on the river as a control sample; E1 &#x02013;effluent discharge point to the river; R1, R2, and R3 located respectively 5, 10 and 15 km downstream on the river from the E1 site. In CRB the sediments were retrieved from 1m water depth during September 2013. The sediments were collected in sterile plastic bags and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until they were shipped to Institute F.A. Forel, University of Geneva, Switzerland for further analysis. Seepage samples are not listed in the DGFT Notification number 27/2007 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of Commerce, and therefore no permit is required for export [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Sediment samples were collected from public areas and facilities.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Total DNA extraction and Quantification of FIB and ARGs</title><p>The total DNA from sediment samples was extracted using the Ultraclean soil DNA Kit (Mo Bio Labs, Solana Beach, CA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. The isolated DNA concentration was measured using Qubit assay kit (Life Technologies, Switzerland) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. For each sediment sample, DNA extraction was performed with three replicate samples (from the same sampling point) to take heterogeneity into account. The DNA samples were diluted to 10x and 50x to avoid inhibitors to the PCR reaction. Specific genes targeted included ARGs (<italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>SHV</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub> and <italic>aadA</italic>), and selected bacterial marker genes {<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<italic>uidA</italic> gene); ENT and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. (16S rRNA gene)}. The selection of ARGs conferring resistance to &#x000df;-lactams and aminoglycosides were based on criteria of clinical relevance, i.e. frequently used Abs, ARGs often reported to be present on mobile genetic elements [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and to better understand the prevalence of metallo-&#x000df;-lactamases in Southern India. The total abundance of the16S rRNA gene was also quantified to estimate total bacterial population size and used for the normalization of ARGs and selected bacterial marker genes abundance relative to total bacterial community size. The primers, qPCR reactions (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149211.s001">S1 file</xref>), control plasmids, calculation for absolute gene copy numbers (gene concentration) and the gene copy numbers normalized to 16S rRNA gene (abundance) were performed as described in previous study [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, all genes were quantified with KAPA SYBR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> FAST qPCR Master Mix Universal Kit (KAPA Biosystems, MA, USA) on Eco<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Real-time PCR system (Illumina, Switzerland) using the primers (Invitrogen, USA) for selected gene targets (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149211.s001">S1 file</xref>).

Data were acquired at 72&#x000b0;C. A melt curve was run at the end for the presence of unique PCR reaction product. All reactions included a negative and a positive control (10 x dilutions of control plasmids). Samples were considered to be below the limit of detection (LOD) or negative for a target gene if &#x02265;2 out of 3 technical replicates were negative or if sample Ct values were &#x02265;Ct of negative controls. For each reaction, the efficiency of the assay was calculated by using the measured slope of the standard curve (E = 10<sup>(&#x02212;1/slope)</sup> &#x02212; 1).

However, the expression of genes is not the central query of this study when the purpose of this study is to address the evaluation of the tropical aquatic environment to serve as reservoirs of ARGs that could be potentially transferred to other bacterial cells through HGT.</p><p>In most developing nations rivers are not only an important part of the country&#x02019;s economy but also can act as a dumping site for communities and industries situated along the river. Wastewater discharges from various sources (industries, hospitals, and communities) have a direct influence on the proliferation and dissemination of emerging contaminants along the receiving river system. Overall, this study supports the hypothesis that the natural environment (i.e., sediments) can act as a reservoir for emerging microbial contaminants such as FIB and ARGs. The relative abundance of ARGs vary according to the seasonal sampling period at HOP and it is likely that these ARGs released/accumulated in the sediments of the sewer systems could be transported to the receiving systems in large quantities during floods and periods of rain. Sediments receiving wastewaters from contemporary sources offer the opportunity to restructure the pollution history and allow us to evaluate the potential impacts of pollution [<xref rid="pone.0149211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The quantification of ARGs in the aquatic ecosystem will facilitate improved risk assessments for the prudent use of Abs in human, animal and agriculture, and will provide baseline information for developing strategies to limit the spread of antibiotic resistance. The results of this study suggest that the discharge of hospital and urban wastewaters into the aquatic systems leads to the dissemination of emerging microbial pollutants. Therefore, the river receiving systems under tropical conditions such as CRB which has average daily peak temperatures reaching 30&#x000b0;C, could potentially favor the transfer of mobile genetic elements carrying ARGs to susceptible bacterial pathogens. Hence further studies are required to unravel the pathways involved in the spread of ARGs and FIB for assessing the human and environment potential risks in similar geographical locations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149211.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>This file includes Tables A and B; Figures A, B and C.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149211.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This result presents the tripartite collaboration between University of Geneva (Forel Institute), University of Kinshasa and Pedagogic National University of Congo (Democratic Republic of Congo), and Jamal Mohamed College-Bharathidasan University (India).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0149211.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kummerer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>. <article-title>Resistance in the environment</article-title>. <source>J Antimicrob Chemoth</source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>54</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>311</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>20</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0149211.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">CDC.
