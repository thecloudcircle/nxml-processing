To date, immunotherapeutic approaches to Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease have mostly targeted amyloid beta as it is a secreted protein that can be found in plasma and CSF and is consequently accessible to circulating antibodies. Few recent publications have suggested the utility of treatment of tau pathology with monoclonal antibodies to tau. Our laboratory has begun a systematic study of different classes of tau monoclonal antibodies using mutant P301L mice. Three or seven months old mutant tau mice were inoculated weekly with tau monoclonal antibodies at a dose of 10 mg/Kg, until seven or ten months of age were reached respectively. Our data strongly support the notion that in P301L animals treated with MC1, a conformational monoclonal antibody specific for PHF-tau, the rate of development of tau pathology is effectively reduced, while injecting DA31, a high affinity tau sequence antibody, does not exert such benefit. MC1 appears superior to DA31 in overall effects, suggesting that specificity is more important than affinity in therapeutic applications. Unfortunately the survival rate of the P301L treated mice was not improved when immunizing either with MC1 or PHF1, a high affinity phospho-tau antibody previously reported to be efficacious in reducing pathological tau. These data demonstrate that passive immunotherapy in mutant tau models may be efficacious in reducing the development of tau pathology, but a great deal of work remains to be done to carefully select the tau epitopes to target.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by NIH grant R37 AG022102 and a grant from Eli Lilly and Co.

The last few years has seen major developments in the tau field that seem likely to have a significant impact on the development of strategies to target insoluble tau aggregates. The idea that tau pathology can diffuse from cell to cell in a prion-like fashion has been shown by different laboratories <xref rid="pone.0062402-Clavaguera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0062402-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Additional publications seem to confirm the spreading of pathological tau in certain transgenic mouse models <xref rid="pone.0062402-deCalignon1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062402-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, again implying the existence of an extracellular tau species that is important in the development of the disease. These studies together with more recent data showing that tau is actively released from cultured cells <xref rid="pone.0062402-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062402-Plouffe1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> suggest that, even under normal conditions, a significant amount of tau is present in the extracellular space. In this context, assuming that tau is at least in part an extracellular protein, efforts to target tau pathology with antibodies appear to be a reasonable exercise.</p><p>Recent studies from different laboratories have strongly suggested that immunotherapy can be an effective means of preventing the development of tau accumulation <xref rid="pone.0062402-Chai2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0062402-Sigurdsson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our initial approach to passive immunotherapy was to attempt to classify the available tau monoclonal antibodies into groups, based on specificity for tau pathology relative to reactivity with normal tau. The assumption was that the nature of the extracellular tau responsible for the spread of tau pathology was distinct from the normal tau form present in CSF of healthy individuals. In the present study, we have selected three tau monoclonal antibodies that were produced and characterized in our laboratory: MC1, DA31 and PHF1 <xref rid="pone.0062402-Jicha1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062402-Acker1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. DA31 is a pan-tau antibody that maps in the amino acid region 150&#x02013;190 of tau; PHF1 detects the pSer396/404 tau epitope present on both normal adult brain tau and PHF-tau, while MC1 recognizes a very specific early pathological tau conformation produced by the intramolecular association between the extreme N-terminus and the third microtubule repeat domain of tau. P301L mice at different ages were immunized with the tau monoclonal antibodies previously described, in an attempt to reduce insoluble tau aggregates and increase their survival rate. Here we show that, in tau mutant P301L mice, monoclonal antibody specificity rather than affinity plays a crucial role in clearing tau pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Animals were used in full compliance with the National Institutes of Health/Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.

JNPL3 mice express 0N4R human tau with the P301L mutation that causes frontotemporal dementia in humans, under the mouse prion promoter. These mice develop neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and in later stage progressive deterioration of the motor function. The main advantage of this model is the relatively early onset of the pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Antibodies</title><p>P301L mice were treated for 4 months with weekly intraperitoneal (IP) injections of purified mouse monoclonal antibodies or saline. MC1, DA31 and PHF1 were used at a dose of 10 mg/Kg. The dose of monoclonal antibody was chosen based on the use of monoclonal antibodies in humans, which is usually in the range of 1&#x02013;10 mg/Kg. The duration of the treatment was established by preliminary experiments in which the extent of pathology was monitored in untreated animals of different ages. Although there is considerable variability in the rate of development of tau pathology in the P301L mice, power calculations suggested that a 40% reduction in pathology would be detectable over 4 months with 15 animals per group.</p><p>MC1 (IgG1) is a well-characterized antibody that recognizes only tau in a pathological conformation, while DA31 (IgG1) is a high affinity tau sequence antibody that recognizes all forms of tau. PHF1 (IgG1) belongs to the group of antibodies directed to phospho-epitopes present on both normal adult brain tau and on PHF-tau, pSer396/404. Measurement of relative affinities of these antibodies is difficult, due to variation in the source of the tau. We have used PHF-tau (0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml) purified from the Alzheimer&#x02019;s brain in a simple ELISA assay to determine the relative binding abilities of several of our monoclonal antibodies. In this type of assay, DA31 and PHF1 have been shown to have much higher relative affinities for PHF-tau than MC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062402-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0062402-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0062402.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Relative affinities of tau monoclonal antibodies.</title><p>PHF-tau (0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml) purified from Alzheimer brain was used in ELISA in order to determine the relative binding abilities of a battery of tau monoclonal antibodies.

Hence, a second series of mice were treated with MC1 to determine if this antibody was also effective when given later in the course of the disease. P301L mice aged 7 months were injected with MC1 (250 &#x000b5;g) once weekly for 14 weeks. There were two control groups: 13 P301L mice were killed at 7 months of age (zero time for this study - no treatment), and 13 P301L mice were injected with saline once weekly for 14 weeks. The study was terminated after 14 weeks because 8 of 13 saline-injected mice showed signs of hind limb weakness. Only 1 of the MC1-injected mice presented such signs, and the study was terminated with the mice approximately 10.5 months old. Immunohistochemical analysis showed reduced staining for pS202 and pT231 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus following MC1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062402-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;C</xref>).

MC1 recognizes an AD specific tau conformational epitope, while DA31 and PHF1 are high affinity antibodies detecting pan-tau or p-tau in both normal and Alzheimer&#x02019;s brain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062402-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, the monoclonal antibodies MC1 and DA31/PHF1 stand on the polar opposites in terms of affinity for PHF-tau, and so does their specificity for pathological tau. Weekly intraperitoneal injections (250 &#x000b5;g) of MC1, DA31 or PHF1 were administered to different cohorts of mice carrying the P301L tau mutation responsible for frontotemporal dementia in humans. We performed three distinct studies: a) 3 months old mice were injected until the age of 7 months with MC1 or DA31; b) 7 months old mice were treated until the age of 10.5&#x02013;11 months with MC1; c) 6 months old mice were administered MC1 or PHF1 to detect their survival rate until 14 months of age maximum. A mock-treated group of age-matched mice was included in each study and injected with saline. As stated previously, we have been reluctant to use a &#x0201c;non-specific&#x0201d; mouse IgG as a control, because of reports of efficacy of intravenous IgG in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease <xref rid="pone.0062402-Relkin1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The selection of a particular mouse monoclonal antibody as a &#x0201c;non-specific&#x0201d; IgG seems inappropriate, given that it is currently unknown if there are &#x0201c;non specific&#x0201d; effects on the human disease; in that particular experimental model we would be undervaluing the effect of tau antibodies in immunotherapy.</p><p>The first experiment of the series was performed on 3 months old P301L mice in order to test if early treatment with tau monoclonal antibodies could &#x0201c;prevent&#x0201d; tau pathology. Biochemical analysis of total and insoluble tau together with hippocampal staining showed a striking superiority of MC1 at reducing the tau burden compared to DA31. Since we were not able to detect any antibody within the neurons, and assuming that tau is physiologically released to the extracellular space, we can support the notion that the mechanism by which these antibodies work is by targeting extracellular PHF-tau. However, why a conformational antibody would work better at reducing tau pathology compared to a pan-tau antibody is still unclear. Our thought is that MC1 specificity in targeting PHF-tau allows this antibody to find pathological tau even if present at a very low concentrations. On the contrary, DA31 targets every form of extracellular tau without any specificity for PHF-tau. Considering that in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease the amount of &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; extracellular tau is probably higher overall, the inability to discriminate between PHF-tau and &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; tau could result in losing therapeutic effect.</p><p>Due to the effectiveness of MC1 in reducing the pathology when used early in the disease, the second study focused on &#x0201c;clearing&#x0201d; preexisting tau pathology: MC1 was injected in older P301L mice, from 7 to almost 11 months of age. The hippocampal CA1 staining showed significant reduction of pathological tau aggregates in the injected mice, in parallel with biochemical data showing decreased phosphorylated insoluble tau. We were not able to detect any effect analyzing total tau or insoluble tau levels. Furthermore, 8 of 13 saline-injected mice showed signs of hind limb weakness whereas only 1 of the MC1-injected mice presented such manifestation. We conclude that MC1 is more effective at prevention of development of tau pathology than at reducing pre-existing pathology, although some benefits were apparent.</p><p>With this in mind, the third study was carried out to determine if antibody therapy was effective at prolonging the life of the P301L mice. Six months old P301L mice were injected with MC1 or PHF1 until severe signs of motor dysfunction occurred. Since DA31 did not exert any beneficial effect in clearing the NFT burden in tau mutant mice, we selected PHF1 as representative of the high affinity tau antibodies to be used in this investigation. PHF1 has already been shown to be efficient at reducing tau pathology when used early in immunotherapy treatments <xref rid="pone.0062402-Chai2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Mice were killed when exhibiting severe lack of escape extension (clasping) together with weakness and paralysis, but both MC1 and PHF1 treated mice did not differ from the saline injected cohort in terms of survival time or amount of insoluble tau. The reason why we were not able to increase the vitality of the immunized mice is unknown. It could be speculated that an earlier intervention (3 months of age) could have been more effective in improving the survival rate of the injected mice, since both MC1 and PHF1 were efficacious in reducing tau pathology in previous studies.</p><p>In summary, this work strongly supports the idea that passive immunotherapy in mutant tau mice can be efficacious in reducing the development of tau pathology. The conformational antibody MC1 appears overall to be superior at reducing tau pathology in P301L mice compared to the high affinity pan-tau antibody DA31: this may shed light on the idea that specificity is more important than affinity in therapeutic applications. Unfortunately, the vitality of the injected mice did not benefit from tau immunotherapy, independently from specificity or affinity of the antibody selected. It is still far from clear if mice with normal human tau transgenes would benefit from treatment with these antibodies. It is also extremely important to establish what characteristics define an effective antibody in different mouse models. Further exploration of possible mechanism of efficacy using both in vivo and vitro systems is clearly important. Considering the potential future translation to human therapeutic trial, it is obvious that a great deal of work remains to be done before suggesting that treatment of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease with humanized tau antibodies should proceed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0062402-MoralesCorraliza1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Morales-Corraliza J, Schmidt SD, Mazzella MJ, Berger JD, Wilson DA, <etal>et al</etal>..
