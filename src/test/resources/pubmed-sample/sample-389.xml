With population rapidly shifting from rural locations towards the cities, urban areas have dramatically expanded on a global scale and represent crystallization points of social, cultural and economic assets and activities. This trend is estimated to persist for the next decades, and particularly the developing countries are expected to face rapid urban growth. The management of this growth will require good governance strategies and planning. By threatening the livelihoods, assets and health as foundations of human activities, another major global change contributor, climate change, became an equally important concern of stakeholders. Based on the climate trends observed over the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and a spatially explicit model of urbanization, this paper investigates the impacts of climate change in relation to different stages of development of urban areas, thus evolving a more integrated perspective on both processes. As a result, an integrative measure of climate change trends and impacts is proposed and estimated for urban areas worldwide. We show that those areas facing major urban growth are to a large extent also hotspots of climate change. Since most of these hotspots are located in the Global South, we emphasize the need for stakeholders to co-manage both drivers of global change. The presented integrative perspective is seen as a starting point to foster such co-management, and furthermore as a means to facilitate communication and knowledge exchange on climate change impacts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We thank the AXA foundation, the BiodivERsA project ENABLE (01LC1615A), and the GREEN SURGE EU FP7 collaborative project (FP7-ENV.2013.6.2-5-603567) GREENSURGE for financial support of this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="27"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The dataset used in the analysis has been made publicly available without restriction in the Zenodo data repository under doi <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.835650">10.5281/zenodo.835650</ext-link>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.835650">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.835650</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The dataset used in the analysis has been made publicly available without restriction in the Zenodo data repository under doi <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.835650">10.5281/zenodo.835650</ext-link>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.835650">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.835650</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rapid urbanization is a key driver of global change, and a significant contributor to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Today, cities are already home to more than half of the world's population and focal points of economic and financial activities, as well as hubs of innovation. Built-up urban areas are expanding dramatically, and at exceptional rates, demanding increasingly more land and natural resources. The total global urban population is estimated to double by 2050, when compared to 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As exemplified most recently when the city of Houston was hit by hurricane Harvey, cities are particularly prone to natural hazards due to their high populations and the high concentration of a wide range of exposed assets. Cities are also prone to the impacts of climate change and climate change-related hazards, which may considerably affect human health and well-being.</p><p>Of these various hazards, water scarcity, drought, flooding and heatwaves are considered the primary climate change-related threats for the urban space [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Water scarcity and drought can be considered as long-term stresses, that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Both conditions can already frequently be observed in many cities, e.g., in the large urban agglomerations of California and Arizona [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the contrary, short-term shocks, such as extreme weather events, can be shown to be further exacerbated by the unique characteristics of urban space [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, the large areas of ground that are impervious to groundwater penetration in cities and their hinterland may contribute to flooding after heavy precipitations events. Cities in low-lying, coastal areas are also at risk of coastal flooding. In addition, extreme temperatures during heat spells or heatwaves may be further exacerbated by urban heat islands [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Climate change may thus exacerbate both hydrological risks&#x02014;i.e., risk of riverine and coastal flooding&#x02014;as well as climatological/meteorological risks such as the risk of excess temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this context, it needs to be noted that this paper considers the aforementioned shocks and stresses, i.e., types of natural hazards, as manifestations of climate change, or as the impacts of climate change, respectively, and these are in turn conceptualized as observed trends in various selected indicators.</p><p>There is an increasing need to estimate the magnitude and impact of climate change on cities and the subsequent derivation of risk management and climate change adaptation options because of the increasing shift of urbanization towards the Global South. Today, more than one third of the world's total population already lives in urban areas of low- and middle-income developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which are expected to absorb the majority of urban growth within the next decades [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, it is also these developing regions that are most often especially vulnerable to climate change due to factors such as their high proportion of poorer communities and lack of proper governance [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Here, vulnerability is defined as a system&#x02019;s susceptibility or inability to cope with the adverse effects of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, vulnerability analysis focuses on the assessment of sensitivity and capacity for adaptation to specific climate change-related hazards, where sensitivity and adaptation capacity of the anthropogenic system are often measured using comprehensive sets of biophysical and socioeconomic indicators [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to both the high need for adaptation in cities, as outlined above, as well as the increasing urban commitment to action on climate change, the assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities is increasingly shifting towards the urban space [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Estimating climate change impacts, sensitivity and adaptive capacity further allows the identification of gaps in current adaptation efforts, i.e., impact-specific adaptation options not yet covered in urban adaptation strategies [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The identification of the need for, and gaps in adaptation allows actions to be prioritized for an effective allocation of limited financial resources. Furthermore, such an identification can aid in focusing available resources on areas where the need for action is highest. However, it has been found that in 2014 out of 401 urban agglomerations worldwide with more than one million inhabitants, 81% provided no evidence of any kind of adaptation to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This included most of the Eastern European, African, Central American, Central and South-Asian cities that were studied. In contrast to this, in 2016, more than 6,700 European cities are in the process of committing to mitigation or are in an early state of assessing vulnerabilities to climate change. Only a few cities, most notably Barcelona, Rotterdam, Copenhagen and Helsinki, have advanced to the point of exploring monitoring schemes for actions that have already been put into action [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Determining adaptation needs and identifying adaptation gaps relies heavily on knowledge about the magnitude of climate change at local level. Unfortunately, local knowledge is a heavily fragmented body of knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This fragmentation&#x02014;in combination with a lack of scientific research and evidence at local levels, as well as a lack of public awareness, funding, and cooperation&#x02014;poses an important barrier to adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In particular, the lack of scientific knowledge at local levels needs to be addressed. Consequently, in this paper, urban hotspots of climate change are identified, i.e., urban land where climate change will likely have a comparatively high impact. In so doing, land and water managers, mayors and risk management shall be provided with a common view of climate change impacts in order to facilitate the transfer of knowledge, stimulate a wider stakeholder discussion on the scope and magnitude of required adaptation measures, and subsequently enable adaptation strategies to resonate between distal urban locations [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been shown that such an exchange of scientific knowledge and international expertise on climate change adaptation is urgently needed by decision-makers [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, the approach presented here will provide anchor points for more specific future research and may also serve as an additional indicator for the discovery of adaptation gaps.</p><p>To establish the aforementioned common perspective, this paper presents an integrative assessment in the form of an observation of changes over the 20<sup>th</sup> century at a global level, however, it looks at urban land on a local scale. This approach assesses climate change impacts as trends or changes, respectively, in mean annual surface air temperature and mean annual precipitation, which in turn are seen as possible drivers of long-term stresses. These observed trends will subsequently be used to derive an integrative, quantitative measure of climate change. In so doing, a quantitative frame of reference for the magnitude of climate change impacts at the local level is elaborated for the global urban land, and hotspots, which are identified accordingly. These long-term trends are further contrasted with selected indicators of heat as an example for the determination of likely trends in short-term shocks.</p><p>The assessed trends and proposed measure of climate change &#x0201c;magnitude&#x0201d; will additionally be put into context with a spatially explicit model of urbanization, that elicits different states of urban development. These states include, e.g., rapidly developing, comparatively young cities that are characterized by extensive spatial extension and large population growth as well as relatively old cities that are spatially and demographically stagnating [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In line with the literature [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this model of urbanization also shows that hotspots of urbanization are predominantly located in the Global South [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In these developing countries, it is more likely that governance performs poorly due to factors such as a lack of efficiency, lack of economic or democratic freedom and widespread corruption. Thus, these countries are not able to meet the demands of sustainable planning and risk management [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this paper, as outlined above, it will be shown that these cities may also be hotspots of climate change where the demand for scientific knowledge to support adaptation is high. In so doing, we make a case for the need to co-manage urbanization and climate change.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The following section proposes an integrative measure of climate change and presents the materials and methods used. Furthermore, attention is given to the aforementioned spatially explicit model of urbanization [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], from which the most important findings that are relevant to this paper will be summarized. Results are presented in a step-by-step manner in section 3 in which firstly, the observed changes and trends in climatic parameters over the 20<sup>th</sup> century are summarized. Secondly, the proposed integrative perspective on climate change is developed, and subsequently exemplified by selected case cities across the globe. Finally, these findings are put into the context of urban development, i.e., the assessed magnitude of climate change observed over the 20<sup>th</sup> century will be aggregated on the level of hypothesized stages of urban development. Thereby, attention will be guided towards specific hotspots of urbanization and climate change. The paper closes with a discussion and conclusions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Climate data</title><p>To determine long-time temperature trends, this study makes use of gridded monthly mean terrestrial surface air temperature data (in &#x000b0;C) for the years 1901&#x02013;2014 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Long-term trends in the total monthly precipitation (in mm) are assessed using the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Full Data Reanalysis dataset for the years 1901&#x02013;2013 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Both datasets have been chosen due to the available length of the time series, and their comparatively high spatial resolution of 1/2&#x000b0; x 1/2&#x000b0;, which is identical for both datasets. This high spatial resolution makes both datasets better suited for the scope of this case study when compared to datasets with a coarser resolution, and also facilitates the integration of both datasets, e.g., by avoiding resampling of grid values. Moreover, both datasets are also well suited for this study due to their global coverage and completeness, thus avoiding missing data.</p><p>The subsequent determination of heat indicators is based on the daily maximum temperature, which has been derived from the NOAA-CIRES 20<sup>th</sup> Century Reanalysis version 2 dataset, which provides 4 times daily temperature estimates for the years 1871&#x02013;2012 as a Gaussian grid with a spatial resolution of approximately 2&#x000b0; by 2&#x000b0; [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], again covering the whole terrestrial surface.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Urban land-use data</title><p>A gridded urban land-use dataset with a resolution of 1/6&#x000b0; x 1/6&#x000b0; has been derived on a global scale from the HYDE 3.1 land-use database [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to approximate the age, total spatial extent, and variability of the spatial extent of urban areas for the period 1900&#x02013;2000. A spatially explicit model of urban development has been proposed on the basis of these indicators [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. From this model, the concept of &#x0201c;maturity&#x0201d; of urban land is of interest for the case made in this paper. Maturity can be understood as the relationship between the age of urban land and its spatial and demographic &#x0201c;stability&#x0201d;. It is conceptualized using local indicators of spatial association (LISA), i.e., four clusters representing spatial autocorrelation [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Matured cities are considered as stable, i.e., lacking substantial large-scale urban growth; this refers to both their spatial extent and their population, either growing relatively slowly or being in stagnation or decline [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Many European core cities fall in this category. Less matured cities, on the other hand, could be referred to as unstable, i.e., still experiencing (rapid) population growth in conjunction with a high variability of their spatial extent due to often fast-paced and tremendous spatial expansion. Cities in developing countries are typical examples of this category.</p><p>In this context, it needs to be noted that the terms urban land, urban area, city, or urban space are used interchangeably in this paper. This is primarily a consequence of the scale of analysis. Due to the global-scale approach, individual cities may be coarsely delineated compared to using e.g. administrative data. Furthermore, since the underlying data source is gridded, the paper refers to grid cells which are classified as urban, thus containing urban area of a given extent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec006" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Integrative measure of the magnitude of climate change</title><p>As previously described, this paper proposes an integrative, quantitative measure of the overall &#x0201c;magnitude&#x0201d; of climate change at local level to subsume the observed long-term trends in mean annual surface air temperature and mean annual total precipitation for the years 1901&#x02013;2000.

Due to the excessive warming and the increase in precipitation in higher latitudes, urban areas located there are mainly affected by this combination of trends. Here, hydrological risk, i.e., risk of flooding, will likely increase for the urban land [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As mentioned earlier, this flood risk may be exacerbated in low-lying regions, which are not only affected by riverine flooding, but also coastal flooding due to sea-level rise. For this, the Netherlands is a prime example. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g005">Fig 5</xref> indicates that warming and an increase of precipitation is observed for many Dutch cities over the 20<sup>th</sup> century. National and communal policies anticipate this trend to continue [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]; amongst other measures, adaptation strategies include an increase of retention capacities and the strengthening of coastal defences to avoid riverine and coastal flooding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189451.t002">Table 2</xref>). Long experiences with flooding and water management help to devise and implement these strategies. Older cities such as Rotterdam, with nearly 80% of the city below sea level and one of the largest ports in the world, have gained centuries of disaster and water management experience. Moreover, it is the maturity of comparable cities&#x02014;i.e., their relatively low population growth or possibly stagnating or declining population, in combination with comparatively low rates of spatial expansion and the application of good governance principles [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]&#x02014;that fosters the implementation of adaptation measures. In this study, it is estimated that in Rotterdam, during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the mean annual surface air temperature increased by approximately 3%, and precipitation by about 10%, with <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>air</italic></sub> &#x0003c; 0.10, however, with <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>prc</italic></sub> &#x0003e; 0.10.

This magnitude of change puts Rotterdam in the 5<sup>th</sup> decile globally, i.e., including all observations of urban land (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189451.t003">Table 3</xref>).

Moreover, although the number of heat days per has increased, there are indications of declining mean daily maximum temperatures of these heat days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

For Surat, this is expected despite the comparatively low increases in surface air temperature of about 2% (p &#x0003c; 0.10), and of about 3% in precipitation (p &#x0003e; 0.10). Consequently, on a global scale, Surat might be considered as only slightly affected by climate change with <inline-formula id="pone.0189451.e015"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0189451.e015.jpg" id="pone.0189451.e015g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M15"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02192;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.041</mml:mn></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, corresponding to the 2<sup>nd</sup> decile. However, compared to e.g. Rotterdam, Surat is in a much less matured state of development, thus featuring extraordinary population growth rates. From 1961 to 2001, the population increased tenfold to approximately 2.4 Mio people, with a decadal growth rate of 93% in the period 1981&#x02013;1991, and 62.4% in the period 1991&#x02013;2001 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; the population is projected to reach 8.5 Mio in 2031. Similarly, the city experienced rapid spatial expansion, from 8.12 km&#x000b2; (1961) to 326.5 km&#x000b2; in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Unregulated urban growth resulted in urban developments within flood-prone areas with a subsequent restriction of water flow. Implementing adaptation measures and lessons learned from past experiences of flooding&#x02014;between 1949 and 1979, Surat was flooded approximately once every four years [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]&#x02014;is substantially hampered by this rapid development. Also regarding heat, Surat faces increased risks, which may severely affect human well-being and human health. Although the average heat spell duration is stagnating, and thus not showing a clear trend, Surat faces an increase of (non-consecutive) heat days, individual heat spells and daily maximum temperatures as risk factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Also the city of Daman (India), located to the south of Surat on the mouth of the Daman Ganga River, experienced an extraordinary population growth of 69.25% in the decade starting in 2000 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

This combination of trends will most likely affect flood risk, e.g., due to more severe extreme precipitation events or coastal flooding due to sea-level rise. The related challenges for managing these hydrological risks are likely similar to the previously explored cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189451.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Trends of decreasing precipitation are predominantly observed in urban areas located in tropical and subtropical climates. Notable hotspots include the Caribbean, the Andean range and the Sahel, which are also hotspots of socioeconomic and ecologic vulnerability. Further affected cities are located in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and South-East Asia. In most of these cases, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, trends of decreasing rainfall are combined with trends of warming. For the affected urban areas, this results in an increasing risk of heatwaves, dry spells, water shortages, water scarcity, or drought. Other impacts include an increased risk of forest fire, desertification, and loss of biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, most of the South-Western United States experiences this combination of trends. Particularly affected are the eastern parts of the Los Angeles county, San Bernardino valley (Barstow), and San Diego, where the combined trends of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation are statistically significant, and the areas thus becoming drier and warmer over the 20<sup>th</sup> century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

However, the number of (non-consecutive) heat days per year and the number of heat spells per year remained above the estimated linear trends at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. For this period, also the mean daily maximum temperatures of heat days have been increasing. This coincides with severe drought conditions repeatedly experienced in this region. Starting approximately in the 1990s, large parts of the South-Western United States, and in particular the South of California, started to encounter exceptional drought conditions [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

Both reservoirs feed large urban agglomerations, e.g., the rapidly growing Phoenix metropolitan area with an approximate population of 4.5 Mio in 2015, and projected 6.8 Mio in 2040 and 7.7 Mio in 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The sprawled Los Angeles county region [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with a population of 10.24 Mio (2016) the most populous county in the US [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], is also fed from the Colorado watershed via the Colorado River Aqueduct, and thus possibly at risk of water shortages if conditions are further deteriorating.</p><p>A risk of increasing drought is also estimated for North Africa, West Africa and the Sahel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g005">Fig 5</xref>). More than 40 percent of Africans live in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. The amount of water available per capita in Africa is already far below the global average and is continuously declining&#x02014;with annual per capita availability of 4,000 cubic meters compared to a global average of 6,500 cubic meters [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Drought is endemic to many African regions and repeated drought cycles killed thousands of people. In addition, the groundwater table is lowered and rainfall is declining in many regions [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. For example, in Sudan, in line with our findings, changes in climate parameters are summarized by reduced precipitation, warming, solar dimming, increasing evapotranspiration, intensifying aridity and an increasing recurrence of drought events [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Khartoum also faces an increase in heat; in line with the long-term trend in surface air temperature, the number of heat days per year, as well as the mean maximum daily temperature of heat days, increased significantly over the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The frequency of heat spells per year increased accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p>An increased risk of drought and subsequent aridification and desertification is also estimated for the so-called <italic>Poligono das Secas</italic>, North-Eastern Brazil&#x02019;s (NEB) Drought Polygon [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], which encompasses several federal states, amongst them the state of Bahia, and which&#x02014;to a large extent&#x02014;features semi-arid conditions in the so-called <italic>Sert&#x000e3;o</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The <italic>Sert&#x000e3;o</italic>, as well as NEB as a whole, is repeatedly affected by droughts. For example, the 1997&#x02013;1999 drought affected about 10 Mio people and more than 1200 municipalities [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Typically, and similarly to Sudan, mostly the poor and their livelihoods are affected&#x02014;and following Kenny, about half of Brazil&#x02019;s poor live in the region&#x02014;due to factors such as the loss of livestock and crops, access to water etc. This often leaves migration as the only feasible option for the most vulnerable population [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Climate change projections based on a downscaled HadCM3 model for the A1B scenario suggest warming of up to 2&#x000b0; until 2040 and 4&#x000b0; for the whole region in 2071&#x02013;2100 alongside a reduction of rainfall particularly over the western parts of NEB, which are currently located at the fringe of the semi-arid zone [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].

In line with these findings, also the mean daily maximum temperature of heat days has increased, thus underlining the potentially increasing drought risk and risk of desertification.

This also holds true for Bras&#x000ed;lia, Brazil&#x02019;s capital region located in the <italic>Distrito Federal</italic> (DF), Brazil&#x02019;s Federal District. The DF is another example of water scarcity induced by overstraining natural resources due to the intensification of agriculture, urbanization and population growth. In the DF, expansion of intensive agriculture and urban sprawl have caused severe losses of native savanna vegetation (<italic>cerrado</italic>) and put an enormous pressure on the region&#x02019;s water resources [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].

The situation in the DF is pressing, since 94% of the population lives in urban areas, where system capacities for water supply are already close to their limits. Water demand will continue to increase in the near future, with the population projected to grow from currently 2.5 Mio to 3.2 Mio in 2025 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].

Consequently, we believe that the state of urban development needs to be considered in impact analysis, since certain stages of the urban development cycle may pose additional barriers for adaptation.

A so-called high-low cluster&#x02014;in the following, HL&#x02014;has been considered as representative for recent and ongoing urbanization. A low-low cluster (LL) is thought to typify comparatively recent urban spread, i.e., urban sprawl due to suburbanization or peri-urbanization. Both clusters can be considered as less matured states of cities. A third cluster&#x02014;high-high (in the following, HH)&#x02014;has also been interpreted to indicate urban spread. However, this HH cluster is seen to characterize comparatively old, large-scale planned city expansions that are typical, e.g., for (Eastern) Europe in the 1960s to 1980s. Finally, a fourth cluster, the low-high cluster (LH), is described to embrace a "final", i.e., matured state of urban development, being characterized by comparatively old age and low variability in spatial extent [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>When looking at the different states of the affected urban areas as indicated by the share of each LISA cluster per world region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), major differences between the world regions become apparent.

Hotspots of ongoing urbanization are marked by the LL and HL clusters [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The combined share of both clusters is particularly high in the Global South, i.e., in Asia (50.4%) and South-East Asia/Australia (58.6%), in Africa (86.9%) and South America (89.9%). This is indicative of the ongoing and comparatively rapid urbanization that these regions are experiencing [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. For example, it has previously been shown that urban areas in Africa are amongst those with the highest magnitudes of climate change, giving rise to a relatively high demand for adaptation. The challenges resulting from the rapid urbanization that these cities are experiencing, as indicated by the corresponding LISA clusters, further increase this demand for sustainable planning, and create needs for additional adaptation due to the increasing number of urban dwellers exposed to climate change. Consequently, a co-management of these two major drivers of global change is highly desirable under these circumstances.</p><p>Contrary to that, in Europe, the combined share of the HH and LH clusters is high with 63.5%, compared to Africa with only 13.1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189451.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Both clusters indicate that the affected urban areas can be considered as relatively &#x0201c;mature&#x0201d;, due to factors such as their old founding age, the lack of recent large-scale urban growth, low rates of spatial expansion, and low population growth rates or stagnating or declining populations. Such &#x0201c;mature&#x0201d;, i.e., stable conditions could generally be considered as beneficiary for the implementation of adaptation measures. However, these cities may need to face other vulnerabilities as a consequence of their sociodemographic structure, particularly due to the aging of their population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>In this paper, we used the Theil-Sen estimate, a robust regression method often used in climate change research, to identify (significant) absolute long-term trends in mean annual surface air temperature and mean annual total precipitation as possible drivers of long-term stresses. The identified trends, which were found to be in line with earlier studies, were subsequently normalized relative to an early 20<sup>th</sup> century baseline. The relative changes obtained in so doing were then mapped onto global urban land, and consequently integrated in the form of the Euclidian distance <inline-formula id="pone.0189451.e031"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0189451.e031.jpg" id="pone.0189451.e031g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M31"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02192;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, which has been proposed as an integrative, quantitative measure of the magnitude of climate change, i.e., as a measure of the combined observed changes in both climatic parameters. The observed long-term trends were further classified into four quadrants or directions of change, according to the sign of both observed trends.</p><p>In this study, heat extremes have furthermore been considered as an immediate and direct impact of climate change at local level. In comparison, hydrological extremes and risks of flooding are substantially more dependent on basin characteristics, i.e., the urban hinterland and rural space, and thus more difficult to assess. Consequently, a focus has been put on heat patterns, which were simultaneously assessed by determining trends in the number of (non-consecutive) heat days and the number of heat spells. Attention was also paid to the mean duration and the average daily maximum temperature of heat spells in order to account for these short-term shocks and their changing patterns as a consequence of climate change. However, trends in hydrological extremes should urgently be revisited in future work.</p><p>Firstly, regarding the elicited directions of change, we have shown that warming has been observed as a very likely trend (p &#x0003c; 0.10) for the vast majority of global urban land, i.e., for 94.7% of grid cells that are classified as urban. Looking at the combined trends of warming and very likely trends in mean annual total precipitation (p &#x0003c; 0.10), it can further be concluded that approximately three quarters of global urban land faces trends of increasing precipitation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, urban areas affected by increasing temperatures and wetter conditions are mostly located in Northern and Western Europe, North America, Northern and Central Asia, and South America. Warmer and drier conditions are primarily found in urban areas in Central America, Northern Africa and the Sahel, Eastern Europe, and, to some extent, South-East Asia. By additionally considering the observed trends in heat indicators, it has furthermore been shown that these urban areas are also increasingly affected by heat extremes.</p><p>Secondly, it is assumed that each observed direction of change is associated with specific climate change-related risks. Wetter conditions are likely associated with increasing hydrological (flood) risks. In combination with warming, this trend may pose additional risks for human health due to the spreading of vector-borne diseases [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Drier conditions likely lead to an increasing risk of water scarcity for both humans and ecosystems, and drought. Warming further exacerbates this risk. The associated increase of heat extremes is seen as an additional risk factor.</p><p>Thirdly, regarding the proposed integrative measure of the magnitude of climate change <inline-formula id="pone.0189451.e032"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0189451.e032.jpg" id="pone.0189451.e032g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M32"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02192;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, it has been argued that <inline-formula id="pone.0189451.e033"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0189451.e033.jpg" id="pone.0189451.e033g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M33"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02192;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> is higher when there are higher observed changes in mean annual surface air temperature, or mean annual total precipitation, or both.

In this context, as described above, the elicited directions of change indicate likely risks that need to be considered.</p><p>Fourthly, it has been argued that the state of urban development is an important factor in the implementation of adaptation measures, which may be hampered in case of less mature cities due to their ongoing urban expansion both spatially and in terms of population growth [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is especially true for the fast growing (mega)cities in the Global South, as exemplified by the case of Surat, where such urban expansion is not only more rapid, but also less controlled and policy-guided compared to more developed countries.</p><p>Finally, in conclusion, it becomes clear that, to a large extent, urban areas in the Global South, particularly Africa, Central and South America, and South-East Asia, are hotspots of climate change as well as hotspots of barriers to adaptation. This is due on the one hand to the prevailing direction of change and the comparatively high magnitudes of observed changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) as well as, on the other hand, to the wide-spread immature state of urban space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) in conjunction with low economic development and the large amount of vulnerable people [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, any of the hazards and risks associated with the observed climate trends&#x02014;in particular heat extremes, water scarcity, and drought&#x02014;have further implications for the socioeconomic development of cities. For example, threatening the health and well-being of urban dwellers, their food security, as well as the energy and resource security of the urban economy [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], can potentially result in civil unrest or armed conflicts [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. It has also been shown that urban expansion further exacerbates climatological risks in which a scarcity of water is not only a result of a lack of supply due to a deficit of precipitation, but also a consequence of increasing residential, economic and agricultural demand, especially in conditions of warming [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Despite urban expansion, water demand is also dependent on urban topology. It has been shown that dispersed, low-density (suburban) housing, typical of urban sprawl, is associated with higher domestic water consumption in comparison to compact, high-density developments [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In either case, increasing demands for freshwater can ultimately deplete an ecosystem&#x02019;s ability to provide services and additionally impact human health and regional-to-global migration. This can lead to calls for more sustainable water management [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], but also underlines the need for an effective management of urbanization. Hence, making a case for co-managing urbanization and climate change is particularly needed in the aforementioned areas of the Global South in order to reduce hindrances and barriers to adaptation. Consequently, the assessment of adaptation gaps should also consider such a co-management of driver processes.</p><p>Nonetheless, in order to facilitate individual adaptation towards climate change and increase the resilience of urban space, action is also needed to reduce the vulnerability of exposed societal groups. For example, drought adaptation measures in the <italic>Sert&#x000e3;o</italic> provide a possible blueprint for addressing drought vulnerabilities in Africa. In this case, water tanks to secure livelihoods were constructed that provided access to freshwater for families and municipalities during prolonged dry spells [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Increasing heat stress in the form of prolonged periods of heat or increasing heat days overall, requires that vulnerability to heat, particularly in the elderly population, needs to be addressed. This can be accomplished by adapting cities to warming through residential construction and building codes, reductions of energy consumption, retrofitting of existing systems, and optimization of urban green and blue infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p><p>Together, the measures discussed above may ultimately result in synergies and benefits that not only assist in adaptation to climate change impacts, but also improve the quality of life. For example, the expansion of urban green spaces could help to reduce flood risks and heat stress by providing retention as well as cooling capacities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189451.t002">Table 2</xref>), but this expansion also provides recreational space and contributes to human health and well-being, and may also positively affect urban biodiversity. Here, the intertwined nature of climate change and public health becomes apparent. Within the context of heat extremes in particular, adaptation strategies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189451.t002">Table 2</xref>) clearly seek to reduce the sensitivity of the urban space to climate change. By securing access to livelihoods, adaptation strategies also address the climate change-related risks of water scarcity and drought and, accordingly, bolster public health and human well-being [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Here, we argue that for a more specific assessment of effects, synergies, and trade-offs, the climate change debate and the ecosystem services community should be firmly linked.</p><p>Clearly, the conclusions drawn above rely heavily on the reliability and accuracy of each of the underlying data sources. Here, possible errors arise from stochastic sampling error as a result of heterogeneous data density across the globe, as well as from the interpolation of measurements to gridded surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These errors apply to all climate datasets used. To reduce uncertainty in modelled precipitation, particular care was taken to check for the plausibility of extreme values [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The relative error in gridded monthly precipitation is estimated to be between &#x000b1;7 to 40% of the true mean precipitation in regions in which 5 stations were used for interpolation, and between &#x000b1;5 to 20% in regions with denser data. If less observations are available for interpolation, the results are less certain. This is the case with results in regions of lower certainty like parts of Northern and Central Africa, South America, Siberia, Central Asia and Australia. However, margin of error also reflects the natural variability in precipitation at a given location, and is thus greater when natural variability is higher [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Regarding surface air temperature, it is expected that there is less certainty in summer compared to winter, with the overall error range being comparable to the range of error of a 2- to 4-day numerical weather prediction and still below overall climatological variability [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There is, however, considerable uncertainty particularly in the tropics and the southern hemisphere for the period before 1935 [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This could explain the observed patterns of relatively sharp decreases of heat days, heat spells and heat spell duration for the Brazilian cases, and thus the rather unexpected linear 20<sup>th</sup> century trends.</p><p>Considering the assessed heat extremes indicators, this study&#x02019;s focus on urban land requires consideration of the urban heat island effect (UHI). It has been shown that gridded climate data, i.e., air temperatures, can indeed reproduce UHI effects, thus showing elevated temperatures in urban compared to rural grid cells, however, at very high spatial resolutions of 1x1 km [<xref rid="pone.0189451.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. With a resolution of 1/2&#x000b0; x 1/2&#x000b0;, and 2&#x000b0; x 2&#x000b0; respectively, the underlying climate data used for this analysis is considerably coarser. Thus, the UHI effect is not expected to be directly or reliably observed due to the mixing of urban and rural grid cells. Consequently, since heat stress is further exacerbated by the UHI, the estimated parameters may actually be underestimating climate change impacts on cities.</p><p>Despite these uncertainties, we nonetheless see the approach used in this study, and the proposed measure of change, to be suitable for at-a-glance comparisons of climate change impacts in localities across the globe. We argue that such an easy means of communicating climate change impacts and risks is a valuable tool for stakeholders, and we particularly hope to foster the exchange of knowledge between cities on a global scale. In this regard, the proposed assessment framework could contribute an additional quantitative scale of reference in order to spark further discussion, e.g., within the 100 Resilient Cities network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.100resilientcities.org/">http://www.100resilientcities.org/</ext-link>). Our approach also provides important anchor points for future research. Firstly, it highlights urban hotspots of climate change and thus identifies areas of risk prevention and related action, and secondly, it emphasizes the aspects and needs that should be taken into account in a more detailed and more specific climate change analysis at regional or local scales, as well as for subsequent assessments of adaptation gaps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189451.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Workflow to determine the model variables.</title><p>The climatic parameters mean annual surface air temperature and mean annual total precipitation have been derived from gridded datasets with monthly values.
