Drug&#x02013;induced nephrotoxicity remains especially difficult to predict in both pre-clinical and clinical settings and is often undetected until patient hospitalization. Current pre-clinical methods of determining renal toxicity include 2D cell cultures and animal models, both of which are incapable of fully recapitulating the <italic>in vivo</italic> human response to drugs, contributing to the high failure rate upon clinical trials. We have bioengineered a 3D kidney tissue model using immortalized human renal cortical epithelial cells with kidney functions similar to that found <italic>in vivo</italic>. These 3D tissues were compared to 2D cells in terms of both acute (3 days) and chronic (2 weeks) toxicity induced by Cisplatin, Gentamicin, and Doxorubicin using both traditional LDH secretion and the pre-clinical biomarkers Kim-1 and NGAL as assessments of toxicity. The 3D tissues were more sensitive to drug-induced toxicity and, unlike the 2D cells, were capable of being used to monitor chronic toxicity due to repeat dosing. The inclusion of this tissue model in drug testing prior to the initiation of phase I clinical trials would allow for better prediction of the nephrotoxic effects of new drugs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health (EB002520) and F.

Compounded upon the cost and time, only about 8% of drugs entering Phase I clinical trial testing make it to market <xref rid="pone.0059219-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This low rate is due to numerous factors including the lack of well-established testing methods capable of accurately predicting clinical usefulness and drug toxicity during pre-clinical development. The FDA's Critical Path Initiative calls for the development of better tools to improve the success of drug candidates that proceed from pre-clinical testing to clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0059219-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Included in this process is the development of human tissue models better capable of predicting human <italic>in vivo</italic> responses, including organ toxicity. The kidney is a major site of drug&#x02013;induced toxicity as it receives about 25% of cardiac output and is a site of significant excretion. Only about 7% of drug candidates fail due to nephrotoxicity in pre-clinical testing with 2D cell cultures and animal models <xref rid="pone.0059219-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, while it is estimated that 30&#x02013;50% of all cases of severe acute renal failure in patients are due to drug&#x02013;induced nephrotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0059219-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Pannu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, current pre-clinical testing methods are not rigorous enough to predict the human response to most drugs.</p><p>Currently, drug&#x02013;induced nephrotoxicity is tested in both monolayer (2D) cell cultures <xref rid="pone.0059219-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Garrett1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and animal models <xref rid="pone.0059219-Harpur1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Gautier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. 2D cell culture models offer the advantage of being simple and low in cost. However, 2D cell cultures are incapable of recapitulating the complexity of the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment <xref rid="pone.0059219-Bissell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and have been shown to often require higher doses over longer time periods to induce a toxic response compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity responses in patients <xref rid="pone.0059219-El1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Animal models provide the benefit of a complex system that is lost with 2D cell cultures. However, animal biology differs in many respects from human biology due to differences in physiology and environment, thus making them capable of predicting human responses only to a certain extent <xref rid="pone.0059219-Knight1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. By default animal trials, in particular rodent studies, are highly ordered with the same genetic backgrounds, ages, environmental factors, and disease states examined in large numbers with many testing methods. This is not the case with human drug testing as genetic backgrounds, ages, and environmental factors cannot be as rigorously controlled, especially in early human trials. Importantly, in the case of drug&#x02013;induced nephrotoxicity, the people most susceptible are those with underlying kidney conditions or currently taking other nephrotoxic drugs. These people are normally not included in clinical trials and so their response is not known until they are actually treated with an approved drug. Animal models are also expensive and pose an ethical issue that is currently being addressed by the principles of 3Rs, replace, reduce, and refine. Bioengineered tissues with human cells are expected to better reflect the situation in patients, as they will allow for acute toxicity testing but also for longer exposures. This may reveal cumulative tissue injury with repeated administration of subtoxic concentrations; a situation more relevant to the clinical practice. Moreover, 3D tissues undergoing compound exposure can be used to detect biomarkers indicative of nephrotoxicity <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus enabling the translation from the <italic>in vitro</italic> to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. Bioengineered 3D tissues have been used for toxicity testing for both human liver <xref rid="pone.0059219-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and skin <xref rid="pone.0059219-Canton1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-KirschVolders1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but a 3D system for human nephrotoxicity testing does not currently exist. Here we describe a bioengineered 3D human renal tissue system and its assessment as a predictor of human nephrotoxicity. The bioengineered tissue is functionally and morphologically similar to human kidney tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>. Treatment of the tissue with known nephrotoxicants showed that the 3D tissue was more sensitive to lower drug concentration than the same cells grown in 2D. Additionally, long term studies revealed the utility of the 3D model for chronic toxicity studies over the 2D system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The NKi-2 cells used in all studies were derived by serial passaging in low serum media of hTERT immortalized human renal cortical cells, a generous gift from Dr. Jing Zhou.

For the functional assays, the 3D tissues were formed and allowed to grow for 2&#x02013;3 weeks prior to testing to ensure proper structural development. These tissues were capable of normal glucose uptake in the presence of NaCl similar to 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059219-g003">

While this is still not fully representative of normal <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior, this response may indicate a more <italic>in vivo</italic>-like phenotype when the cells are grown in a more complex 3D environment. Finally, since the ability to transport compounds across the cell membrane is vital for a nephrotoxic response, we also looked at the expression of particular transport proteins known to function in the human kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059219-g003">

The NKi-2 cells expressed transcripts for MRP2 and 4 in both 2D cell culture and 3D tissues, while MDR1 was not expressed in either case. Interestingly, both megalin and MRP5 were expressed in 3D tissues, but the transcripts were not detected when the same cells were in 2D monolayer culture. MRP2 and MDR1 have been shown to be involved in doxorubicin uptake <xref rid="pone.0059219-Couture1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> while megalin is involved in gentamicin uptake <xref rid="pone.0059219-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme released by cells upon damage to the plasma membrane and is used often in cytotoxicity assays as it can be measured in the cell culture supernatant over time. However, its usefulness for our 3D cultures was not clear. In order to validate the usefulness of LDH secretion for toxicity measurements with our 3D tissues, we collected supernatant from 3D tissues after treatment with a range of cisplatin concentrations (0 to 100 &#x000b5;M) over a 2 week period and analyzed for LDH activity. Cisplatin is a cancer therapeutic that is highly nephrotoxic with its dose limited by the initiation of renal failure in patients <xref rid="pone.0059219-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

<bold>Fig. 4C</bold>
</xref>).This may reflect the cell death that occurs over time in 2D culture due to increasing cell confluency and indicate that Kim-1 may be a good marker for 3D tissues but not for 2D cell culture due to the high background expression level. NGAL expression did not change as significantly as Kim-1 over time in untreated samples and there was no significant difference between the NKi-2 cells in culture and the 3D tissues over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059219-g008">

Expression of Kim-1 at the two highest treatment levels dropped immediately to zero for all three drugs, reflecting the highly toxic nature of the highest drug concentrations and are therefore not shown on the graphs.

This may indicate a cumulative tissue injury with repeated dosing at these low drug concentrations; a situation more relevant to clinical practice than acute cytotoxic effects at high doses. Importantly, for all three drugs, 2D cell culture secretions were higher than their 3D tissue counterparts. This may be due to the ease of release in 2D compared to 3D where Kim-1 may get retained in the ECM components.</p><fig id="pone-0059219-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0059219.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Kim-1 and NGAL secretion in untreated NKi-2 cells and 3D tissues.</title><p>Untreated NKi-2 cells were grown for 24 hours followed by media sampling at 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days.

<bold>Fig. 10C</bold>
</xref>). Unlike Kim-1, there was not as big a difference between 2D cultures and 3D tissues in terms of overall NGAL secretion. In fact, doxorubicin 3D tissues had a greater increase in NGAL secretion over time than did the same treatment groups in 2D. Sasaki et al has shown that rats dosed with cisplatin or gentamicin can take up to 7 days to have increased expression of Kim-1 and NGAL in their urine at high doses <xref rid="pone.0059219-Sasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, indicating that our time course may be relevant to <italic>in vivo</italic> situations. Our data also shows the usefulness of our 3D model over 2D culture for the interpretation of biomarker data as the 3D tissues do not have as high a level of background expression as the 2D cultures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The incredibly poor success rate of drugs that enter clinical trials, a better understanding of the limitations of 2D cell culture, and initiatives to reduce the number of animals used for drug testing, have driven a recent push in the development of 3D human tissue models for the study of drug toxicity. It is hypothesized that these 3D human tissue models will better recapitulate the human <italic>in vivo</italic> response to drugs. Here we have characterized a new and unique bioengineered 3D model of human kidney tissue and applied it to the testing of drug-induced nephrotoxicity in comparison to 2D cell culture. We have shown that the 3D tissue model has a different timing of toxicity induction compared to 2D culture and is more sensitive to drug dosage, having lower LD<sub>50</sub> values. Furthermore, we have shown the utility of this model for chronic toxicity testing and examined the relevance of pre-clinical markers for monitoring toxicity in 3D.</p><p>Previous 2D models of nephrotoxicity have relied upon primary proximal tubule cells <xref rid="pone.0059219-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Presumably this allows for the monitoring of toxicity in a cell in a state very close to the <italic>in vivo</italic> state in terms of gene expression. However, primary cells are not a constantly renewable source, requiring re-isolation from other patients due to their inability to proliferate over numerous passages <xref rid="pone.0059219-Hayflick1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and the changes in gene expression they undergo relatively quickly upon <italic>in vitro</italic> growth <xref rid="pone.0059219-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. To overcome this problem, our bioengineered 3D human renal tissue described here consists of hTERT immortalized human renal epithelial cells of primarily proximal tubule origin. It has been shown that immortalized cells lose the expression of organic anion transporters and other proteins compared to primary cells <xref rid="pone.0059219-Nanus1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, potentially impairing their suitability for toxicology testing. However, the use of immortalized cells for toxicology would provide genetic consistency compared to the variability inherent in using primary cells from different patients and may allow for the production of a renewable, stable collection of cells for testing different disease states. hTERT immortalization of human renal epithelial cells has been shown to not have a significant effect upon their function <xref rid="pone.0059219-Wieser1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and we have shown in our studies that our hTERT immortalized renal epithelial cells have more <italic>in vivo</italic> like renal function in 3D culture compared to 2D culture, maintain the expression of OAT1 and OAT4, and renew the transcription of megalin when grown as a 3D tissue. An additional problem with the use of immortalized cells lines is their constant proliferation which would make them unsuitable for long term chronic studies. This is evident in our data in which LDH increases over time in 2D without drug treatment. However, this problem was not evident in 3D tissue culture. They did not over proliferate, destroying the bioengineered tissue, even after 8 weeks of culture. This may be the result of signaling events between the ECM and the cells or a result of their formation into 3D structures. Further examination of the 3D model may reveal the reason for the apparent senescence of the cells in 3D compared to 2D and further research into drug toxicity mechanisms should provide further evidence of the utility of immortalized kidney epithelial cells for <italic>in vitro</italic> drug testing.</p><p>One of the best ways to gauge the toxic effect of a compound on a system and compare it to other systems is with an LD50 value. Significantly, toxicity data in our 3D model revealed a decrease in the LD50 for both gentamicin and doxorubicin compared to both our NKi-2 cells in 2D and previously published values for hRPTEC <xref rid="pone.0059219-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Additionally, while cisplatin LD50 was similar between 2D and 3D, with the 3D being higher, both values were lower than published values for hRPTEC <xref rid="pone.0059219-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and HK-2 cells <xref rid="pone.0059219-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While it is difficult to translate this into <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance, previous studies of gentamicin toxicity in 2D have shown that extremely high doses and prolonged periods of exposure are necessary to achieve maximum toxicity compared to what is required in patients <xref rid="pone.0059219-Servais1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Taken together, this indicates that our bioengineered 3D model is more sensitive than the cells used in it in 2D and hRPTECs. In the future, this data may be used to better direct the dosing studies performed in animals thereby reducing the number of animals used in a study. Furthermore, the inclusion of 3D model data with animal data may be able to better predict the toxicity of a compound and the acceptable dose range in patients.</p><p>Unlike <italic>in vivo</italic> kidney injury testing that can examine BUN and serum creatinine levels, <italic>in vitro</italic> testing is limited to either non-specific markers of cell death such as LDH or, in the case of the kidney, specific markers of renal epithelial cell injury such as Kim-1 and NGAL. To better reveal the usefulness of our bioengineered 3D model for pre-clinical drug testing, we looked at the secretion of these pre-clinical biomarkers. The use of these biomarkers <italic>in vitro</italic> may be limited as NGAL has been shown to be upregulated upon proximal tubule cell preparation <xref rid="pone.0059219-Weiland1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and Kim-1 may not be properly expressed in cells in 2D culture <xref rid="pone.0059219-Rached1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Our cells in 2D culture expressed significantly higher levels of Kim-1 than in 3D tissues. When this is combined with our data revealing more <italic>in vivo</italic> like function in 3D, it suggests that the cells may behave more like their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts when allowed to form 3D structure. Additionally, the loss of viable cells within the model system due to high toxicity was evident by the loss of Kim-1 expression. The ability to use pre-clinical biomarkers with the 3D human renal tissue constructs indicates both their similarity to <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue and their usefulness for future nephrotoxicity studies.</p><p>We have shown that a 3D model of human renal tissue is feasible and can be applied to pre-clinical drug testing with approved biomarkers. While the use of 3D models for nephrotoxicity studies has been explored using mouse tubules imbedded in hydrogels <xref rid="pone.0059219-Astashkina1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059219-Astashkina2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, this is the first model to not only look at function of human kidney epithelial cells in a hydrogel system, but to also apply it to the determination of nephrotoxicity. This model system has the potential to limit the amount of animals needed in pre-clinical testing and may better inform upon dosing in patients. Further studies examining the expression of transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes and the mechanism of drug action in the cells in the 3D model will serve to better validate the system and reveal its suitability for studying drug toxicity mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Jing Zhou and Dr. Wassim Al-joudi for the immortalized human renal cortical epithelial cells used in this study.
