During the recovery process after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS), it is important to perform follow-up measurements of the activity concentrations of radiocesium in mushrooms. We evaluated the activity concentrations of the detected artificial radionuclides (radiocesium) in wild mushrooms collected from Kawauchi village, which is within 30&#x02009;km of the FDNPS, in 2015, four years after the accident. We found that the radiocesium was determined in 147 of 159 mushroom samples (92.4%). Based on the average mushroom consumption of Japanese citizens (6.28&#x02009;kg per year), we calculated committed effective doses ranging from &#x0003c;0.001 to 0.6&#x02009;mSv. Although committed effective doses are relatively limited, even if residents have consumed mushrooms several times, continuous monitoring of the radiocesium in mushrooms in Fukushima is needed for sustained recovery from the nuclear disaster.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011, and the resulting tsunami triggered a nuclear reactor accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Station (FDNPS). Due to this accident, huge amounts of radionuclides, including radioiodine and radiocesium, have been released into the environment. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) estimated the total amount of released radionuclides to the atmosphere for iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I), cesium-134 (<sup>134</sup>Cs), and cesium-137 (<sup>137</sup>Cs) at 120.0, 9.0, and 8.8 petabecquerel (PBq), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">After the accident, to minimize internal exposure from consuming contaminated foods, the Japanese and prefectural governments initiated food monitoring, including of milk, vegetables, grains, meat, and fish, and other foods containing radioactive materials that exceeded the provisional regulation values were prohibited from distribution and consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Due to these policies, internal exposure doses among the residents of Fukushima were relatively limited. Internal radiation exposure doses from the activity concentration of artificial radionuclides have been evaluated by whole body counters (WBCs) in Fukushima Prefecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Fukushima Prefecture reported the results of internal radiation doses measured from June 2011 to October 2016 in 307,208 individuals. Of these, 307,182 (99.9%) showed a committed effective dose less than 1&#x02009;mSv. These results suggested that internal radiation exposure doses among the residents of Fukushima are limited thanks to food-monitoring policies.</p><p id="Par4">On the other hand, it is well known since the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant that radiocesium tends to concentrate in wild mushrooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Recently, we evaluated the activity concentration of the detected artificial radionuclides (radiocesium) in wild mushrooms collected in Kawauchi village (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), located within 30&#x02009;km of the FDNPS, and we found radiocesium activity concentrations exceeding 100&#x02009;Bq/kg (the current regulatory limit for radiocesium for general foods) in 125 of 154 mushrooms (81.2%) collected in 2013, two years after the accident<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. During the recovery process following the accident at the FDNPS, it is important to perform follow-up measurements of the radiocesium in mushrooms, to monitor the dynamics of radiocesium in the environment, and to minimize the internal radiation exposure of residents of Fukushima through the consumption of contaminated foods. In this study, we evaluated the radiocesium in wild mushrooms in Kawauchi village collected in 2014 and 2015, three and four years after the accident.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Location of Kawauchi village, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_5963_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e341"/></fig>

In accordance with the shorter half-life of <sup>134</sup>Cs, the activity concentrations of <sup>134</sup>Cs (half-life&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.1 years) in 2015 were significantly lower than those found in 2014, whereas there was no difference in the activity concentrations of <sup>137</sup>Cs (half-life&#x02009;=&#x02009;30.1 years) between 2014 and 2015. Although the residential houses have been extensively decontaminated since the accident, the forests of Fukushima Prefecture have not been decontaminated yet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As our results suggest that it takes time to observe a decrease in the radiocesium in wild mushrooms, careful discussion will be needed among stakeholders to determine the necessity of decontaminating the forests in Fukushima.</p><p id="Par10">On the other hand, we calculated committed effective doses ranging from &#x0003c;0.001 to 0.6&#x02009;mSv based on the average annual intake of mushrooms by Japanese citizens. Previously, we calculated effective doses ranging from 0.1&#x02013;1.60&#x02009;mSv in 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These results suggest that internal radiation exposure due to the consumption of wild mushrooms remained relatively limited in Kawauchi village. We have evaluated the activity concentrations of radiocesium in local foods produced in the village in 2013 and 2014. We showed that the number of samples exceeding the regulatory radiocesium limit (100&#x02009;Bq/kg for general foods) was five of 4,080 sampled vegetables (0.1%), 652 of 1986 (32.8%) sampled edible wild plants and fungi, and eight of 647 (1.2%) sampled fruits. In addition, the internal radiation doses resulting from ingesting these foods ranged from 24.4 to 42.7&#x02009;&#x003bc;Sv for males and from 21.7 to 43.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;Sv for females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; this confirms that the internal radiation doses are acceptably low compared to the public dose limit of 1&#x02009;mSv/year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Although residents who returned to the village may have a higher chance of consuming locally produced foods, it does not increase the meaningful of internal doses.</p><p id="Par11">Kawauchi village is the first local authority to return to its hometown following the evacuation after the accident<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Currently, almost 68% of residents returned to the village and restarted their lives. Before the accident, the village was famous for its wild mushrooms, including <italic>Sarcodon aspratus</italic> and <italic>Tricholoma matsutake</italic>. Because the collection and consumption of wild mushrooms is a part of the culture of this village, residents are keenly interested in the radiocesium in the wild mushrooms. In 2013, we began collaborating with residents to prepare a &#x0201c;mushroom map&#x0201d; that includes information about radiocesium concentrations in the mushrooms collected in the village<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. During the recovery phase from the nuclear disaster, the engagement of stakeholders, including residents, local authorities, and scientists, is important to deciding the future direction of the community. The International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) emphasizes that stakeholder engagement is key to the development and implementation of radiological protection strategies for most existing exposure situations, and as experience in stakeholder engagement has grown, it has become possible to use many of the lessons learned as a basis for the development of best practices among the radiation protection community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We believe our collaboration in Kawauchi village will contribute to the development of such practices.</p><p id="Par12">Our study has several limitations. We could not evaluate the relationship between radiocesium activity concentrations in mushroom samples and the concentrations in soil due to insufficient soil samples. Further comprehensive studies are necessary to evaluate the activity concentrations of radiocesium in mushroom samples in Fukushima after the accident. Additional analytical uncertainties arise because the committed effective doses from dietary intake of mushrooms cannot measure day-to-day variations in individuals. Further, we did not evaluate the potential loss of radiocesium upon cooking in mushrooms. The influence of eating habits, including cooking methods, must be considered. In this study, we evaluated internal doses from the ingestion of mushrooms, but we did not evaluate the external doses received from being in contaminated forest areas while collecting mushrooms. Further comprehensive analyses with detailed reports on all areas around FDNPP are needed.</p><p id="Par13">In conclusion, we evaluated the activity concentrations of radiocesium in wild mushrooms in Kawauchi village collected in 2014 and 2015, three and four years after the accident, and we confirmed that radiocesium was still detected in most samples. We explained our current results to the residents in the village. Although committed effective doses are relatively limited, we believe that continuous monitoring of the activity concentrations of radiocesium in mushrooms and risk communication with residents in Fukushima is needed for sustained recovery from the nuclear disaster.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sampling of mushrooms</title><p id="Par14">All wild mushrooms were collected in Kawauchi Village (the public office, N37&#x000b0; 20&#x02032;, E140&#x000b0;48&#x02032;), Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Kawauchi village is located approximately 20 to 30&#x02009;km southwest of the FDNPP and was partially included in the Evacuation Order Area (within a 20-km radius of the FDNPP). During the initial phase of the accident at the FDNPP, almost all residents were evacuated from the village. Saito <italic>et al</italic>. reported soil deposition density maps of gamma rays that were constructed on the basis of results from large-scale soil sampling in June 2011; these maps showed levels of artificial radionuclides of 100&#x02013;300&#x02009;kBq/m<sup>2</sup> for <sup>134</sup>Cs and 100&#x02013;300&#x02009;kBq/m<sup>2</sup> for <sup>137</sup>Cs in Kawauchi village<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. On 31 January 2012, the head of Kawauchi village declared that residents who resided at least 20&#x02009;km away from the FDNPP could return to their homes based on the declaration by the Japanese Prime Minister that the FDNPP reactors had achieved a state of &#x0201c;cold shutdown&#x0201d; in December 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

We asked residents of the village to collect mushrooms and to show the location of each mushroom. We collected 81 <italic>Sarcodon aspratus</italic> mushroom samples from September to November of 2014, and 159 mushroom samples of 23 species from September to November of 2015. Among the 159 mushroom samples collected in 2015, 68 (43.0%) were <italic>Sarcodon aspratus</italic>, 17 (10.7%) were <italic>Hygrophorus russula</italic>, and 10 (6.3%) were <italic>Albatrellus confluens</italic> (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The variety of collected mushrooms is quite wide, but some of these are not well known or easy to find, so they were not included in the sampling as they are less likely to be collected for ingestion. All mushroom samples collected were classified according to type into their typical categories of saprophytic or symbiotic, as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par16">After collection, all samples were washed by water to remove the soil, and broken into smaller pieces using a mixer machine. The samples, approximately 41&#x02009;g each wet weight (median), were enclosed in 100-mL plastic containers made of polypropylene (inner diameter, 50&#x02009;mm; height, 14&#x02013;42&#x02009;mm) for radionuclide measurements. All samples were measured fresh and analyzed with a high-purity germanium detector (ORTEC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, GMX30&#x02013;70, Ortec International Inc., Oak Ridge, TN, USA) coupled with a multi-channel analyzer (MCA7600, Seiko EG&#x00026;G Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) for 3,600&#x02009;s. The measuring time was set to detect the objective radionuclide, and the gamma-ray peaks used for the measurements were 604.66&#x02009;keV for <sup>134</sup>Cs (2.1&#x02009;y) and 661.64&#x02009;keV for <sup>137</sup>Cs (30&#x02009;y). Decay corrections were made based on the sampling date, and detector efficiency calibration was performed for different measurement geometries using mixed-activity standard volume sources (Japan Radioisotope Association, Tokyo, Japan). Activity concentrations of radiocesium were automatically adjusted based on the date of collection, and the data were defined as the activity concentrations at the collection date. The relative efficiency was 31%, and energy resolution of the spectrometer was 1.85&#x02009;keV for <sup>60</sup>Co. The detection limit was 11.5&#x02009;Bq/kg for <sup>134</sup>Cs and 9.2&#x02009;Bq/kg for <sup>137</sup>Cs (median), and counting errors were &#x000b1;7.3&#x02009;Bq/kg for <sup>134</sup>Cs and &#x000b1;14.1&#x02009;Bq/kg for <sup>137</sup>Cs, respectively. Sample collection, processing, and analysis were executed in accordance with standard methods of radioactivity measurement authorized by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. All measurements were performed at Nagasaki University (Nagasaki, Japan). The sum of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations was indicated as &#x0201c;activity concentration of radiocesium&#x0201d; in order to aid comparison with the current regulatory limit for radiocesium (100&#x02009;Bq/kg for general foods), which is determined by the central governments of Japan. In most samples, mushrooms contained <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs. However, in some samples, only <sup>137</sup>Cs was detected, because <sup>134</sup>Cs concentrations were below the detection limit.
