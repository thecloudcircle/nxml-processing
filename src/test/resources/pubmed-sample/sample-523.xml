<italic>Rickettsia parkeri</italic> is an emerging eschar-causing human pathogen in the spotted fever group of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and is transmitted by the Gulf coast tick, <italic>Amblyomma maculatum</italic>. Tick saliva has been shown to alter both the cellular and humoral components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, the effect of this immunomodulation on <italic>Rickettsia</italic> transmission and pathology in an immunocompetent vertebrate host has not been fully examined. We hypothesize that, by modifying the host immune response, tick feeding enhances infection and pathology of pathogenic spotted fever group <italic>Rickettsia</italic> sp. In order to assess this interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, a pilot study was conducted using five rhesus macaques that were divided into three groups. One group was intradermally inoculated with low passage <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> (Portsmouth strain) alone (n = 2) and another group was inoculated during infestation by adult, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>-free <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> (n = 2). The final macaque was infested with ticks alone (tick feeding control group). Blood, lymph node and skin biopsies were collected at several time points post-inoculation/infestation to assess pathology and quantify rickettsial DNA. As opposed to the tick-only animal, all <italic>Rickettsia</italic>-inoculated macaques developed inflammatory leukograms, elevated C-reactive protein concentrations, and elevated TH1 (interferon-&#x003b3;, interleukin-15) and acute phase inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6) post-inoculation, with greater neutrophilia and interleukin-6 concentrations in the tick plus <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> group. While eschars formed at all <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation sites, larger and slower healing eschars were observed in the tick feeding plus <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> group. Furthermore, dissemination of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> to draining lymph nodes early in infection and increased persistence at the inoculation site were observed in the tick plus <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> group. This study indicates that rhesus macaques can be used to model <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> rickettsiosis, and suggests that immunomodulatory factors introduced during tick feeding may enhance the pathogenicity of spotted fever group <italic>Rickettsia</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">http://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>; grant numbers: 5P20GM103458, AI077784).

During this time frame, <italic>Rickettsia parkeri</italic>, a member of the spotted fever group (SFG) of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> transmitted by <italic>Amblyomma maculatum</italic> (the Gulf coast tick), was first identified as a human pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] with several cases reported in North and South America [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clinical signs include fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, formation of a maculopapular rash and multiple eschars [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The eschar, along with milder symptoms, can be used to differentiate this disease from the more virulent <italic>R</italic>. <italic>rickettsii</italic>, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>-associated eschar is a 0.5&#x02013;2 cm in diameter, crusted, non-pruritic ulcer, surrounded by an indurated, erythematous halo. These lesions are characterized histologically by extensive necrosis of the epidermis and superficial dermis and prominent lymphohistiocytic vasculitis of dermal vessels [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite the recent emergence of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>, there have been few experimental models detailing the pathology, immune response and transmission of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> in mammalian hosts. A murine model has been developed in C3H/HeJ mice [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Using this model, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> nymph feeding subsequent to intradermal injection of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> resulted in increased pathogen load and associated pathology when compared to needle inoculation alone [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, C3H/HeJ mice have a mutation in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Signaling via TLR4 is needed for stimulation of dendritic cells and activation of natural killer cells, which kill SFG <italic>Rickettsia</italic>-infected cells [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, in order to study the immune response to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>, an immunocompentent host would be necessary. While immunocompentent cotton rats become infected with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> after subcutaneous injection, they do not develop characteristic eschars [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Eschars formed after intradermal inoculation of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> in a guinea pig model; however, the effect of inoculation on other organ systems and the underlying immunology were not evaluated [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In order to model human pathology and immune response, immunocompentent rhesus macaques were used in this pilot study.</p><p>As reviewed recently by Wikel [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], tick saliva contains substances that are capable of inhibiting a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and several other bioactive molecules. Tick saliva also has the ability to impair the function of several immune cells including natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and T and B lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While much of this work is based on other hard tick species, salivary molecules of <italic>Amblyomma</italic> sp. have been shown to inhibit chemokine, natural killer cell, and dendritic cell functions [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is no surprise that with this immunosuppressive ability, tick feeding has been found to enhance transmission of a variety of tick-borne pathogens including viruses (Thogotovirus and tick-borne encephalitis virus) and bacteria (<italic>Borrelia afzelii</italic>, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic>, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>lusitaniae</italic>, <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, and <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the effect of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> feeding on <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> rickettsiosis and the immune response in a mammalian model has not been comprehensively studied.</p><p>The experiments detailed in this report were designed to reproduce disease caused by <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> via intradermal inoculation during adult <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> feeding in rhesus macaques as compared to two other treatments: <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> feeding alone. The broad hypothesis is that by modulating the host immune response, tick feeding enhances infection and pathology of pathogenic SFG <italic>Rickettsia</italic>. We demonstrated that tick feeding during <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation resulted in larger areas of necrosis with delayed healing as compared to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation alone. Furthermore, greater neutrophilia and interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations were noted in animals inoculated during tick feeding. Lastly, in a tick + <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> animal, rickettsial DNA was detected in a draining lymph node in the acute phase of infection and in the skin at the inoculation site in the chronic phase of infection suggesting the possibility of greater dissemination and persistence of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> in response to tick feeding. Taken together, these results reveal the utility of a primate model of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> infection and demonstrate that tick feeding can modify the pathogenesis of tick-borne rickettsiosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Tick and <italic>Rickettsia</italic> Preparation</title><p>A colony of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>-free <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> was maintained on rodents as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All animals that were used for tick-rearing purposes were housed at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM) vivarium on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with ad libitum rodent feed and water. Animals were housed in social pairs or groups appropriate to the species until tick placement; at which point, they were housed individually in order to prevent partner manipulation of tick containment devices. Larvae were fed on adult BALB/c mice (LSU DLAM, Baton Rouge, LA, USA) that were housed on wire grates over fresh water, and engorged larvae were collected twice daily as the water was changed. Nymphal and adult ticks were fed on adult Sprague-Dawley rats (LSU DLAM) or adult Hartley guinea pigs (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) within capsules fashioned from plastic 50 ml conical tubes and attached with a 3:1 tree rosin to bee wax mixture. After tick collection following feeding to repletion and dropping off of their hosts, animals were humanely euthanized with carbon-dioxide followed by cervical dislocation. Animal care and use for tick rearing purposes was approved by the Louisiana State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Protocol Number: 13&#x02013;034).</p><p>The ticks used in this experiment were determined to be free of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> via DNA extraction and traditional semi-nested PCR using the 190.70p and 190.602n and 190.70p and 190.701 primer pairs for <italic>Rickettsia ompA</italic> as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Rickettsiae were enumerated after staining with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a Petroff&#x02013;Hausser bacterial counting chamber (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, USA) and examined with a Leica microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The rickettsiae were resuspended in sucrose-phosphate-glutamic acid buffer (SPG) [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to obtain the desired inoculation dose of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> live rickettsiae/200 &#x003bc;L, a dose that is at the high end of the range of total <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> DNA found in wild-caught <italic>Amblyomma</italic> ticks [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and is similar to the dose used in previous animal models of rickettsioses [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Practices in the housing and care of nonhuman primates conformed to the regulations and standards of the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. The IACUC at the TNPRC approved all animal-related protocols specific to this study, including <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation, tick infestation and sample collection from nonhuman primates (Protocol number: P0222) and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. All animals received standard primate feed as well as fresh fruit and enrichment daily, and had continual access to water. Primates were housed in pairs within treatment groups prior to and after tick infestation. Single housing was required during tick infestation in order to prevent partner manipulation of jackets and tick containment devices. Single cages are 4.3ft<sup>2</sup> x 30&#x0201d;. Pairs were housed in larger cages, which at a minimum provide at least 4.3ft<sup>2</sup> x 30&#x0201d; per animal. Animals greater than 10 kg were allocated twice this amount of space. All animals received standard enrichment tailored to the species as dictated by the Animal Welfare Act and outlined in the TNPRC Policy on Environmental Enrichment (e.g., objects to manipulate in cage, varied food supplements, foraging and task-oriented feeding methods, interaction with caregivers and research staff). All animal procedures were overseen by TNPRC veterinarians and their staff and their welfare was monitored daily. Complete physical exams (including evaluation of the integumentary, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems) were performed, and rectal temperatures and weights were taken prior to each procedure. In order to alleviate animal suffering, the macaques were anesthetized for all procedures with 5&#x02013;8 mg/kg Telazol intramuscularly (IM) followed by ketamine in small increments of 2&#x02013;5 mg/kg IM as needed. In addition to this anesthetic protocol, all animals were pre-emptively given 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine IM as additional analgesia for biopsies. None of the animals in this study demonstrated any deterioration in physical condition that required euthanasia during the experiment as determined by the standard TNPRC endpoint policy; therefore, the experimental endpoint for this study was 31&#x02013;35 days post-<italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>/Vero cell lysate inoculation (31&#x02013;35 dpi). At this point, the macaques were humanely euthanized at via administration of 5&#x02013;8 mg/kg Telazol IM and 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine IM followed by an overdose with 156 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital via intracardiac injection, a method that is consistent with the recommended guidelines of the American Veterinary Medical Association.

All animals were shaved and fitted with primate jackets (Lomir Biomedical, Inc., Notre-Dame-de-l&#x02019;&#x000ce;le-Perrot, QC, Canada) one week prior to tick infestation to allow the primates to become acclimated to them. The tick exposure groups were infested with five male and ten female adult ticks using a tick containment device as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The number of ticks was chosen based on the fact that they could comfortably feed and engorge in the space allowed within the containment device. Male ticks were placed on the host and allowed to attach one day after applying the tick containment device, followed by female tick infestation two days later to stimulate the production of pheromones secreted during male feeding, such as the attraction-aggregation-attachment pheromone, which facilitate female tick attachment and feeding [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The tick feeding sites and containment devices were assessed, cleaned, and reinforced as needed at 3, 7, and 12 days post female tick infestation.

The macaque serum samples were used as primary antibody, goat anti-monkey IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard &#x00026; Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer was used as the secondary antibody, and the reaction was visualized with the OptEIA tetramethylbenzidine substrate reagent set (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After a 15-minute incubation, the reaction was stopped with 2N sulfuric acid, and optical densities (ODs) were read with a Spectramax M2 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 450 nm minus the absorbance at 650 nm. Additionally, serum from a mouse previously inoculated with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as the secondary antibody and wells without serum were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Samples were run in triplicate and the mean ODs were calculated after subtracting the ODs in the wells without antigen from the ODs in the wells with antigen. Samples that were positive at 1:64 were then subjected to two-fold serial dilutions until negative to get an endpoint titer, as has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

The route of rickettsial inoculation used in this study, intradermal inoculation during tick feeding, while not replicating natural tick transmission of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>, was chosen in order to evaluate the effect of tick feeding on rickettsial pathogenesis as compared to the same dose of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculated alone. If tick inoculation of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> was used instead, an appropriate <italic>Rickettsia</italic>-only control would be lacking as the dose and time-course of tick inoculation of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> remains undefined. Despite the fact that too few animals were utilized to perform statistical analysis, several conclusions can be made from this pilot study. All four rhesus macaques that were inoculated with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> developed an inflammatory leukogram characterized by mild to moderate neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Furthermore, moderate to marked elevations in CRP concentration, a major acute phase protein in rhesus macaques [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and IL-6 concentration were noted during the same time frame. These abnormalities indicate activation of the innate immune response. Local inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, are produced by innate immune cells in response to foreign substances [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], in this case <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>. This leads to production of acute phase proteins, like CRP, by hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow storage pool within hours after the inciting stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Inflammatory mediators also cause reduction of the circulating lymphocyte pool due to multiple factors including increased migration to inflamed tissues, increased homing to lymph nodes, and decreased migration from lymphoid tissue back to blood [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A similar pattern of inflammation was noted in experimental <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> infection in mice [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as well as in natural infection of humans with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>conorii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Elevation of serum IFN&#x003b3; and IL-15 concentrations were also noted in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>-inoculated animals at 1 and 4 dpi indicating evidence of a TH1 response in these animals, which has been well described in SFG rickettsiosis [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Mild increases in serum IL-15 concentrations were also noted in the tick-only animal at 4 and 11 dpi, which is unexpected as tick feeding has been shown to downregulate the TH1 response [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. While this finding could simply be an anomaly due to subject variability, further study is needed to define the role of this cytokine in the response to tick infestation. Tick feeding has also been shown to result in a TH2 response [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]; however, differences in TH2 cytokines were not detected in the serum of tick infested animals in this study, which could be attributed to the fact that these cytokines act locally at the feeding site and are not produced in large enough quantities to be detected in the peripheral blood. However, it is worth noting that many of the previous studies reporting cytokines induced by tick feeding were performed in BALB/c mice, which have a TH2-biased immune response [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Future experiments should include evaluation of cutaneous cytokine concentrations at the tick bite site in larger numbers of non-human primates to see if the Th1 versus Th2 cytokine paradigm is valid in this species. Furthermore, all animals inoculated with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> developed anti-<italic>Rickettsia</italic> IgG titers greater than or equal to 1:256 at 11 dpi with at least a 4-fold increase in convalescent titers indicating exposure and the appropriate antibody response to the pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although rickettsial infections are typically associated with fever, elevated body temperature was not detected in any of the animals during the study. All animals were anesthetized during temperature evaluations; therefore, the induced hypothermia could have masked a potential fever. Continuous temperature monitoring could be of benefit to detect fever in future studies, as has been reported in rhesus macaques inoculated with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>turicatae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>Experimentally-induced eschars, the hallmark gross lesions consistently found in human cases of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> rickettsiosis, [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], were reproduced at all cutaneous <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation sites in this study. Histologically these lesions were characterized by diffuse infiltrates of macrophages and neutrophils in the acute phase of infection and perivascular dermatitis with infiltrates of predominantly lymphocytes and plasma cells in the chronic phase of infection, both of which have been described in human cases of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> rickettsiosis [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, similar to human cases of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> rickettsiosis, mild to marked dermal vasculitis was noted in two macaques inoculated with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> during the acute phase of infection and maculopapular rashes were noted in both macaques in the tick + <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> group [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Anti-<italic>Rickettsia</italic> IHC revealed the presence of few to many organisms within cutaneous inoculation sites primarily within macrophages and occasionally neutrophils as identified by nuclear morphology. The presence of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> primarily within inflammatory cells within cutaneous lesions as opposed to endothelial cells is similar to what is reported in the literature for human cases of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> rickettsiosis [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], an interesting finding that requires further study given the predilection of other SFG <italic>Rickettsia</italic> for endothelial cell infection.</p><p>Tick feeding during <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation consistently resulted in enhanced gross lesions as well as a greater systemic inflammatory response in the acute phase of infection. Interestingly, tick feeding during <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation did not have an effect on cutaneous rickettsial load at 4 dpi with decreased numbers of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> detected at 9 dpi. This is in contrast to previous studies in mice, where nymphal tick feeding post-<italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> inoculation resulted in increased bacterial load in the skin at 8 dpi [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This difference could be an artifact of sampling, where, despite our best efforts, the 4-mm biopsies may not have been representative of the overall lesion. We also cannot rule out the possibility that tick feeding prior to inoculation primed the immune response leading to increased clearance of bacteria at the inoculation site. Nevertheless, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> DNA and rare organisms were detected in a lymph node of an animal in the tick + <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> group by qPCR and IHC, as well as at the site of inoculation at 32 dpi by qPCR. These results suggest that tick feeding may facilitate dissemination and persistence of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>. However, significance of these findings should not be overstated as they are based on data from one animal. Future study with larger animal numbers would be needed to confirm these results.</p><p>The presence of rare <italic>Rickettsia</italic> noted in the tick-only animal at 4 dpi in the skin by IHC is attributed to transmission of <italic>Candidatus</italic> &#x0201c;Rickettsia andeanae,&#x0201d; a rickettsial species with no known pathogenicity, which has been detected in wild-caught <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and was detected in low prevalence in the larval progeny of the ticks used in this experiment. The observed transmission of low numbers of <italic>Candidatus</italic> &#x0201c;Rickettsia andeanae&#x0201d; has been previously reported when persistently infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>maculatum</italic> nymphs were fed on mice [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similar to this previous report, rare bacteria were noted in the tick-only animal in this study via IHC, but not by either qPCR or two rounds of traditional PCR. This finding could indicate that IHC is more sensitive than PCR in detecting low rickettsial loads after DNA extraction, or it could be a result of sampling error, where low numbers of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> were present in the tissue sample for IHC, but not sampled in the tissue section for PCR. The amount of disease caused by transmission of <italic>Candidatus</italic> &#x0201c;Rickettsia andeanae&#x0201d; in this study is uncertain, as mild peripheral neutrophilia and marked neutrophilic dermatitis were detected at 4 dpi in this animal without elevations of inflammatory cytokines or acute phase proteins in the peripheral blood. This inflammation could be attributed to the tick inoculation of bacteria; however, an inflammatory reaction to the partially purified Vero cell lysate injection or tick feeding could not be ruled out. Ideally, future study would include Vero lysate injection alone, <italic>Candidatus</italic> &#x0201c;Rickettsia andeanae&#x0201d; injection alone, and <italic>Rickettsia</italic>-free tick feeding as additional experimental groups. The lack of anti-<italic>Rickettsia</italic> antibody production in the tick-only animal indicates that the innate immune response alone is likely sufficient to clear the <italic>Candidatus</italic> &#x0201c;Rickettsia andeanae.&#x0201d; Further study is needed to characterize the pathogenic potential of this organism in comparison to a known human pathogen like <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic>. However, such a study would rely upon the <italic>in vitro</italic> propagation of <italic>Candidatus</italic> &#x0201c;Rickettsia andeanae,&#x0201d; which has been proven difficult to culture, growing slowly and in low numbers in mammalian, insect and tick cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135175.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>In summary, rhesus macaques prove to be a valuable animal model for studying the immunobiology of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> rickettsiosis.
