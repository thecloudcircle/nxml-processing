In the present work we demonstrate the partitioning of this peptide to the inner membrane and matrix of mitochondria when it is perfused into isolated rat hearts. We also used ammonium sulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and chloroform/methanol precipitation of heart effluents to demonstrate reduced card-iac troponin I (cTnI) release from ischemic rat hearts perfused with this inhibitor. 50% (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> saturation of perfusates collected from Langendorff rat heart preparations optimally precipitated cTnI, allowing its detection in Western blots. In hearts receiving 20 min of ischemia followed by 30, or 60 min of reperfusion, the Mean&#x000b1;S.E.

It occurs as a consequence of a heart attack when one or more of the coronary arteries become occluded, typically by atherosclerosis or thrombosis. This leads to regional deprivation of the myocardium to oxygen, nutrients and other factors, and if the blockage is not relieved promptly, cardiac cells experience severe energy deprivation, the loss of ion homeostasis, excessive proteolysis, oxidative stress, and additional damaging events, which culminate in cell death <xref rid="pone.0070580-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Solaini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Currently, the most successful strategy for minimizing cardiac IR injury is to restore blood flow and &#x0201c;reperfuse&#x0201d; the tissue. However, considerable injury also occurs during reperfusion <xref rid="pone.0070580-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Solaini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and improved therapeutics for IR injury are desperately needed.</p><p>Following a prolonged IR insult, intracellular proteins are released from cardiac muscle cells and can be detected in serum as biochemical markers of cardiac IR injury <xref rid="pone.0070580-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Fredericks1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. At present the preferred protein used for this purpose is cardiac troponin I (cTnI) <xref rid="pone.0070580-Apple11" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070580-Vogt1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. cTnI is a myofibrillar protein which complexes with tropomyosin and troponins T and C to minimize Ca<sup>++</sup> binding to troponin C, and prevent subsequent crossbridge formation between the actin and myosin myofilaments <xref rid="pone.0070580-Bers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Hence, it plays a crucial role in the diastolic relaxation. It has only &#x0223c;50% amino acid homology to skeletal muscle TnI and is found almost exclusively in the heart <xref rid="pone.0070580-Fredericks1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The effects of cardiac IR injury on cTnI depend on the duration of the insult. During mild cardiac ischemia proteolysis of cTnI may not lead to its release from cells, and instead contributes to reversible contractile dysfunction known as myocardial stunning <xref rid="pone.0070580-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In prolonged ischemia or IR, cTnI is released into serum, mostly as a consequence of cardiac myocyte necrotic cell death <xref rid="pone.0070580-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070580-Fredericks1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Many laboratories have previously focused on mechanisms of cardiac IR injury and protection mediated by the protein kinase C (PKC) family <xref rid="pone.0070580-Baines1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In support of this, previous studies have reported a PKC&#x003b5;-selective activating peptide and a PKC&#x003b4; translocation inhibitor peptide that induce cardio-protection from IR injury in cardiac myocytes <xref rid="pone.0070580-Inagaki2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, isolated hearts and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in transgenic mice <xref rid="pone.0070580-Inagaki1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Inagaki2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, a PKC&#x003b4;-selective translocation inhibitor, administered immediately following a prolonged ischemic insult, improved the recovery of mouse heart ATP levels during oxygenated reperfusion <xref rid="pone.0070580-Inagaki2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We have also previously demonstrated, in neonatal cardiac myocytes, that the &#x003b5;PKC isozyme protects cytochrome oxidase <xref rid="pone.0070580-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070580-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> during PC and the &#x003b4;PKC isozyme interacts with the &#x0201c;d&#x0201d; subunit of F<sub>1</sub>Fo ATP synthase (dF<sub>1</sub>Fo) to inhibit F<sub>1</sub>Fo function, impair energetics, and reduce survival following prolonged hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Instrumental in this latter work was a peptide developed in our laboratory, which inhibits the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction <xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The F<sub>1</sub>Fo-ATP synthase is the terminal complex in oxidative phosphorylation and supplies over 90% of cardiac energy, making it a logical focus of cardiac IR research. It is a 16-subunit enzyme complex associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) <xref rid="pone.0070580-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. During severe heart attacks the IMM gradient, which supplies the energy for F<sub>1</sub>Fo-ATP synthase, is lost <xref rid="pone.0070580-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As a consequence, the F<sub>1</sub>Fo-ATP synthase first becomes inhibited and then operates in reverse as an ATPase <xref rid="pone.0070580-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Solaini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Initially this allows the F<sub>1</sub>Fo complex to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix which in-turn, re-establishes some of the lost IMM potential (&#x003a8;m) <xref rid="pone.0070580-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, if ischemia is not interrupted, F<sub>1</sub>Fo ATPase contributes heavily to the loss of myocardial ATP and consequent cell death <xref rid="pone.0070580-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Solaini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition, the return of aerobic ATP synthesis is impaired following heart attacks, during reperfusion, but the mechanisms for this delay are not completely known. Previous studies have proposed that cardiac preconditioning (PC), a cardio-protective response against IR injury, inhibits F<sub>1</sub>Fo ATPase-mode activity <xref rid="pone.0070580-Takeo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Vuorine1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which may contribute protection by reducing ATP hydrolysis after ischemic insults. There have also been reports that PC induces an improved recovery of cardiac ATP levels following prolonged IR injury <xref rid="pone.0070580-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Solaini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Vogt1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The F<sub>1</sub>Fo complex therefore, has the potential to impact thousands of energy-requiring processes that contribute to normal cardiac functioning and IR injury.</p><p>In our studies with the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor we wanted to complement other methods of quantifying infarct size (e.g. triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining techniques) with a confirmatory biochemical marker of myocardial injury, such as cTnI release.

Effluents (50 ml) from Langendorff-perfused hearts were collected at the indicated times, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until use in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> precipitations. Thawed effluents were then placed in a 100 ml beaker with a stir bar, and gently stirred in an ice bath. (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added slowly (&#x0223c;1.5 g every 3 min), and allowed to dissolve until final concentrations were achieved. Samples were stirred on ice for an additional 1 hr., and then centrifuged (4&#x000b0;C) at 20,000&#x000d7;g for 15 min in a Beckman JA-20 fixed-angle rotor. Supernatants were carefully removed, so as not to disrupt the protein pellet at the bottom of the tube, and were discarded. The inside of the centrifuge tubes were blotted dry with Kimwipes, taking care to avoid the bottom 3 cm where the protein pellets were. Next, proteins were resuspended in 180 &#x000b5;l of solublization buffer (SB) (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 &#x000b5;g/ml each of PMSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and transferred to a 2 ml microfuge tube, on ice. This step was repeated twice to rinse residual amounts of precipitated protein out of the centrifuge tube. Each 180 &#x000b5;l wash with SB was placed on ice in a separate 2 ml microfuge tube. Following washes with SB, the large Beckman centrifuge tubes used for the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> precipitation were further washed with 600 &#x000b5;l of room temperature (RT) methanol, which was then transferred to one of the microfuge tubes that contained the 180 &#x000b5;l of SB wash prepared in the previous steps. This methanol step was repeated 2 additional times with each 600 &#x000b5;l methanol volume being placed in one of the remaining microfuge tubes (with 180 &#x000b5;l of SB wash). During these (SB/methanol) steps, the bottom 3 cm of the large Beckman centrifuge tubes were meticulously washed using a pipettor on all sides, at least 5 times, to recover as much protein as possible. From this point on, all steps were conducted at RT. Samples in the microfuge tubes containing SB (180 &#x000b5;l) and methanol (600 &#x000b5;l) were vortexed and then 150 &#x000b5;l of chloroform was added, followed by vortexing. Next, 450 &#x000b5;l of deionized water was added to each tube, the tube was vortexed, and then subjected to centrifugation (12,000 rpm) for 5 min in a microfuge. The top phase of the resulting solution was discarded and 450 &#x000b5;l of methanol was added to each tube, followed by vortexing. A second 12,000 rpm centrifugation was conducted and the supernatant was discarded. The inner walls of the microfuge tube were blotted dry with Kimwipes, being careful not to touch the pellet at the bottom of the tube. At this stage large white pellets were observed which contained substantial amounts of residual (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. It was therefore, necessary to re-dissolve the pellets in 150 &#x000b5;l of SB and then repeat the entire Chl/MeOH precipitation protocol (as described above) one time to rid the sample of excess (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

We anticipated that the amount of cTnI released from our Langendorff heart preparations might be at the lower limit of detection and that there could be poor recovery of low amounts of cTnI following the Chl/MeOH extractions. We therefore, first evaluated the efficiency of Chl/MeOH precipitation of cTnI from rat heart homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Since we did not add SBTI to the rat ventricle homogenate, but it was added to the 50 ml Kreb&#x02019;s buffer samples used for cTnI precipitation we hypothesized that the &#x0223c;20 kDa protein might be SBTI. SBTI is not found naturally in rat hearts, and we added a known amount of it to each (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> precipitated sample. We reasoned that SBTI might therefore, be useful as a standard to normalize the recovery of protein from the centrifugation steps in each (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> precipitation.

Next, since the ultimate goal of these studies was to test the effects of our &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor peptide on cTnI release after IR injury, we subjected hearts to a 1 hr perfusion, which normally would reflect the peptide loading (PepLoad) phase.

As expected, we observed some protein release immediately following the 20 min equilibration period, but very little protein was released after the 1 hr PepLoad period. In contrast, protein release increased immediately following the 20 min ischemia period, and with increasing reperfusion durations, we observed a time-dependent increase in total protein release, consistent with increasing cardiac cell injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Also of interest, we observed many more proteins being released in the reperfusion period than in any of the other stages of the protocol. Note that the SBTI recoveries observed in the Ponceau S stains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) were corroborated when we probed these same blots using the SBTI antisera (bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Of interest, we observed significantly less SBTI precipitation in effluents collected from hearts immediately following the 20 min equilibration (Eq) period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>) when compared to all other groups (Eq vs. 10 or 60 min p&#x0003c;0.001, Eq. vs all other groups p&#x0003c;0.05).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figures 4C and E</xref> demonstrate significant detection of cTnI release from our Langendorff heart preparations following 20 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. We actually began to see modest cTnI release as early as 10 min of reperfusion in some experiments. The Mean&#x000b1;S.E. (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) % of maximal cTnI release observed following 20 min of ischemia and 30, 60 or 150 min of reperfusion were determined to be 30&#x000b1;7 (p&#x0003c;0.005), 60&#x000b1;17 (p&#x0003c;0.008), and 100 (0.0001) %, respectively. Prior to developing this technique we had difficulty consistently estimating cardiac cell necrosis after IR using cTnI release with commercially available ELISAs, or by using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining of heart sections, unless at least 90 min of reperfusion was given (not shown). This is an important point since the time course of increasing cTnI release, rather than levels at a single point, are often the most convincing evidence for confirming myocardial infarction in clinical situations <xref rid="pone.0070580-Twerenbolda1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Further, our results may suggest earlier events in the IR injury spectrum, which could be modulated by cardio-protective substances. Another interesting point with regard to the use of sample normalization with SBTI can be seen in the last (right most) effluent tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figure 4C</xref>. Note that there was substantial cTnI detected following 150 min of reperfusion in western blots. However, based on the low SBTI immunoreactivity corresponding to that gel lane, we hypothesize that there was poor protein recovery in that group in this experiment. Consequently, with SBTI normalization the amount of cTnI released in that group is higher than that shown in the blot. These results demonstrated the utility of this approach for monitoring cTnI release following IR injury in this model.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Perfusion of Langendorff Rat Heart Preparations with the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo Interaction Inhibitor Reduces cTnI Release Following Prolonged IR Injury</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g005">Figure 5</xref>, hearts were perfused as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figure 4A</xref> however, in this case, 50 nM concentrations of the cell-permeable, mitochondrially-targeted &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor, or a scrambled-amino acid sequence inactive control peptide <xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, were administered during the 1 hr PepLoad phase of the protocol.

Further, it allows protection in Langendorff heart models to be detected at earlier reperfusion times than TTC staining or (in our experiments) cTnI ELISAs.</p><fig id="pone-0070580-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0070580.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor reduces cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release when perfused into Langendorff hearts.</title><p>Experimental details were as described in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figure 4</xref> except that during the peptide loading phase 50 nM concentrations of the scrambled sequence (inactive) control peptide or the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor peptide were administered to hearts for 1 hr.

We felt that demonstration its presence at these submitochondrial sites would strengthen our overall hypothesis that the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo binding interaction contributes to cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury by inhibiting the F<sub>1</sub>Fo enzyme complex and that the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor attenuates this interaction to protect against this injury. We therefore, conducted studies to determine if perfusion of rat hearts with this peptide allowed its targeting to these submitochondrial sites. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6</xref> hearts were perfused in Langendorff mode with 50 nM concentrations of the FLAG epitope-tagged &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor peptide for 1 hr at 37&#x000b0;C. Hearts were then perfused for 5 min with Krebs buffer without peptide and left ventricles were harvested for western blot analyses with anti-FLAG antisera. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6A</xref> illustrates FLAG immunoreactivity in crude IMM, and mitochondrial matrix fractions isolated by hypotonic lysis and differential centrifugation techniques as described in Methods. Since the &#x0201c;d&#x0201d; subunit of F<sub>1</sub>Fo ATP synthase (dF<sub>1</sub>Fo) is found in the mitochondrial matrix our results suggest that following perfusion of hearts with the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor, sufficient FLAG epitope-tagged inhibitor peptide is delivered to the matrix to bind &#x003b4;PKC and prevent its interaction with dF<sub>1</sub>Fo. It is important to note that the protein concentration of the IMM fraction was 5 times greater than that of the matrix fractions.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6C&#x02013;H</xref> hearts were first perfused with this compound, perfused an additional 5 minutes with oxygenated Krebs buffer without the peptide, and then subsequently perfused with fixative (Methods). Cardiac ventricular tissue (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) was then cut into 4 cross sections. From one of these sections (as shown by the white &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) we excised a 2 mm cube of tissue for embedding and the preparation of thin sections for TEM. Thin sections were blocked and probed with a 1&#x02236;5 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antisera and then subjected to immunogold labeling using gold particle-labeled anti-mouse secondary antisera. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6C</xref> shows a representative cross section of cardiac ventricle from hearts loaded with the FLAG epitope-tagged &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor peptide. Note the substantial areas of high density (gold particle) staining in most mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) compared to the &#x0201c;no FLAG antisera control&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6</xref> D). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6E</xref> shows an enlargement of a mitochondria from a left ventricle section prepared from hearts loaded with our peptide.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figures 6C, D and E</xref> we also observed some staining in the mitochondrial outer membrane. We hypothesize that the presence of the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor in the OM reflects its interaction with TIM/TOM mitochondrial protein uptake machinery as it is taken up into mitochondria and ultimately delivered to the IMM or matrix. In contrast, in thin sections prepared identically to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6E</xref> we observed virtually no immunogold labeling when the anti-FLAG primary antisera (but not the gold-labeled secondary antisera) was omitted.

Similar to our results with anti-FLAG immunogold stained sections from intact ventricle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6G</xref> shows substantial labeling of the mitochondrial matrix, IMM, and OM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g006">Figure 6H</xref> represents the control staining in purified mitochondria when the anti-FLAG antisera was omitted. Collectively these data represent the first demonstration that the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor partitions to sub-mitochondrial sites when perfused into rat hearts. Of most importance, we observed substantial presence of the peptide in the mitochondrial matrix where the &#x0201c;d&#x0201d; subunit of F<sub>1</sub>Fo ATP synthase exists and hence the proposed site of the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction which we hypothesize inhibits F<sub>1</sub>Fo functions during cardiac IR. Our peptide therefore, appears to be delivered to the correct submitochondrial loci when perfused into Langendorff rat hearts to antagonize this interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Considerable effort has gone into the development of rapid ELISA assays for the detection of cTnI released into the bloodstream as a confirmatory marker of myocardial infarction. cTnI can be quite stable in human blood with increases in its levels being readily detectable at 6&#x02013;8 hr after ischemia and it can remain elevated for days <xref rid="pone.0070580-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Further, newer &#x0201c;high sensitivity cTnI assays may allow detection of &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;, (non-MI) cTnI levels and also allow a more rapid detection of elevated cTnI levels in patients having an MI [4,33,36). Many recent studies have used ELISA detection of cTnI release from perfused hearts as an indicator of cardiac injury <xref rid="pone.0070580-Bi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070580-Sigg1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Therefore, the reasons for our lack of consistent cTnI detection using a high sensitivity rat cTnI ELISA are not fully understood. Many factors can alter cTnI detection in ELISA-based assays, some of which may help to explain our results. These include: poor cTnI recoveries during sample volume reduction or centrifugation steps; the use of different cTnI antisera in the ELISA kits <xref rid="pone.0070580-Christenson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, cTnI proteolysis <xref rid="pone.0070580-Christenson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Labugger1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070580-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>/phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Jaquet1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Labugger1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>/complexing with other proteins <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and the concentrations of fibrin or anticoagulants in samples <xref rid="pone.0070580-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In most cases, the results from different ELISA kits are not even directly comparable, with up to 20-fold variations in cTnI values being reported using different cTnI ELISAs on the same samples <xref rid="pone.0070580-Labugger1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. There is also currently no cTnI standard to normalize the results from one cTnI ELISA to another <xref rid="pone.0070580-Apple11" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Also of importance, cTnI levels can be elevated under numerous non-myocardial infarction (MI) conditions such as in marathon runners <xref rid="pone.0070580-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, hypertensive emergencies <xref rid="pone.0070580-Afonso1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> toxicity due to chemotherapeutic agents [47,48), and chest trauma <xref rid="pone.0070580-Bertinchant1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Therefore, even though cTnI is currently the preferred confirmatory biochemical marker of MI, and is often very helpful in this context, obtaining consistent cTnI values, and the interpretation of cTnI ELISA results, can be complicated. For this reason, clinical cTnI levels are used in conjunction with other indicators of MI such as electrocardiograms and echocardiography. Finally, and of direct relevance to this study, different animal species have been reported to have variable responses in ELISA-based cTnI detection and cTnI can also be elevated in those models under non-ischemic stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0070580-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Serra1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>Indeed, numerous sources of variability exist with current cTnI detection assays. Therefore, to confirm the cardio-protective actions of our &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor using a biochemical marker we found it necessary to use a non-ELISA-based approach. We first piloted concentration of 50 ml Langendorff effluents using Centriprep-10 concentrators and found very sporadic and often non-existent cTnI detection. This was not improved if Centriprep concentrated samples were subjected to chloroform-methanol precipitation. Since the concentration of these samples required long centrifugation periods and often the rate of sample concentration varied between samples, we believe that the time required for these concentrations may have allowed excessive proteolysis, oxidation or non-selective adherence of cTnI protein to the concentrator. Next, we attempted acid protein precipitation of rat heart homogenate protein (e.g. perchloric and others) which were also unsuccessful. Essentially, we observed normal protein band patterns in our (acid precipitation) blots by Ponceau S. staining, but we could not detect cTnI or SBTI in these Western blots. We experimented with a range of concentrations of total heart homogenate protein that was extracted with perchloric or other acids. We also neutralized homogenates to pH 7, and even performed a second precipitation step using chloroform/methanol. None of these manipulations allowed us to detect cTnI or SBTI in Western blots. It is possible that the acid extraction or one of the subsequent steps altered crucial epitopes in the cTnI or SBTI proteins such that our antisera could no longer detect them in Western blots. We then tested the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> protein precipitation method and found that it obviated the above mentioned problems encountered with other concentration methods.</p><p>Another important point is that <italic>in vivo</italic>, mostly cTnI fragments, not the holo-protein are found in serum after an MI. This has been found in many Langendorff heart studies as well. We found the release of only a &#x0223c;25 kDa cTnI protein species after ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g004">Figures 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g005">5</xref>). We therefore, cannot rule out the possibility that additional cTnI fragments were not detectable using our approach and therefore, the effects of the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor on the release or stability of these fragments is unknown. Numerous studies have reported cTnI proteolysis or other modifications, in cardiac myocytes or serum, following different periods of ischemia and reperfusion <xref rid="pone.0070580-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-Labugger1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. For example, studies by McDonough et. al subjected rat hearts to 0, 15 or 60 min of ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion and applied a TnC affinity column, cTnI antisera and spectrometric analyses to demonstrate progressive degradation of cTnI as the intensity of ischemic insult was increased <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These authors found that rat holo-cTnI has 210 amino acids (AAs) and was progressively degraded to fragments containing AAs 1&#x02013;193, 63&#x02013;193 and 73&#x02013;193, respectively. Degraded cTnI fragments also formed complexes with troponin C (TnC), and troponin T (TnT), some of which may occur because of crosslinks induced by transglutaminase (30). There were numerous methodological differences between their study and ours. For example, we did not use a TnC affinity column to purify cTnI. We observed a 25 kDa species of cTnI that was released from perfused rat hearts following IR injury and did not determine if this was holo-cTnI or a cTnI fragment, only that it was detected in western blots by an antisera directed at a cTnI epitope in the center of the protein. We selected this antisera because previous studies have suggested that, following IR injury, cTnI is progressively proteolyzed from the N- and C-termini and antisera directed towards an epitope in the center of the protein should detect most of these fragments. It is possible that the other fragments detected by McDonough et. al were generated in our experiments, but not released because the duration of ischemia used in our experiments was different, or we used different electrophoresis conditions.</p><p>In another study, Labugger et. al developed Western blot techniques to detect holo-cTnI and 11 fragments of cTnI in the serum of patients undergoing acute MI <xref rid="pone.0070580-Labugger1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These patients however, did not have the precisely controlled durations of ischemia and reperfusion found in our experiments and insults were likely longer. These authors also spiked human serum with recombinant cTnI and incubated the serum with alkaline phosphatase. Their results indicated that much of the cTnI found in human serum from MI patients is phosphorylated or proteolyzed <xref rid="pone.0070580-Labugger1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Additionally, one study reported the loss of at least some cTnI fragments in Langendorff perfused hearts after ischemia if reperfusion is conducted for &#x0003e;1 min <xref rid="pone.0070580-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, much shorter than the reperfusion points used in our study. In addition, cTnI has also been reported to be proteolyzed inside of cardiac myocytes after 15&#x02013;25 min of global ischemia <xref rid="pone.0070580-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> or in ventricular biopsies from patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Further, the C-terminus of cTnI can be degraded when recombinant cTnI is exogenously added to human serum <xref rid="pone.0070580-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Also, covalent complexes between cTnI/cTnC and cTnI/cTnT have been reported after brief ischemia and may be lost with prolonged ischemia <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Finally, PKA-induced phosphorylation of cTnI at its N-terminus may prevent cTnI degradation <xref rid="pone.0070580-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It is therefore, possible that the &#x0223c;25 kDa cTnI species we detected was somewhat protected from degradation because it was either complexed with other proteins or phosphorylated.</p><p>Our previous studies demonstrated improved energetics and survival in neonatal cardiac myocytes pretreated with the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor just prior to prolonged hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0070580-Nguyen3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In work to be published elsewhere we have also demonstrated that Langendorff hearts incubated with the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor enhanced ATP levels following a prolonged IR protocol. We propose that excessive inhibition of the F<sub>1</sub>Fo synthase by a &#x003b4;PKC interaction with the dF<sub>1</sub>Fo subunit plays a significant role in cardiac IR injury, and that our novel peptide could provide a mechanism for attenuating these effects. This study also demonstrates for the first time that our FLAG epitope-tagged &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo interaction inhibitor peptide could be detected at the mitochondrial matrix and IMM where the F<sub>1</sub>Fo ATP synthase complex exists. We have further shown the protective actions of our peptide against cardiac IR injury by demonstrating reduced release of the clinically relevant biochemical marker of cardiac cell necrosis, cTnI in hearts perfused with the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor. Regardless of whether we could detect all previously reported cTnI fragments, we did observe significant decreases in the release of the &#x0223c;25 kDa cTnI species when hearts were preincubated with the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor and not with a scrambled-sequence, inactive control peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070580-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This inhibitor also reduces infarct size when monitored using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining of heart sections (not shown). These results corroborate one another and support a highly protective role for the &#x003b4;PKC-dF<sub>1</sub>Fo inhibitor against cardiac IR injury. The present study provides the first evidence for protection of intact rat hearts against IR injury by this energy-preserving compound and describes a novel approach for monitoring cTnI release from perfused rat hearts. Collectively, this work supports the development of a novel class of translational pharmaceutical to protect hearts against ischemic injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Drs.
