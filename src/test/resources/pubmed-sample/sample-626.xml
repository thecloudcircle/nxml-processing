There were approximately 22,240 new cases and 14,030 deaths associated with ovarian diseases in the United States in 2013 <xref rid="pone.0115708-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One reason for this high mortality rate is that ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at late-stage. Surgical resection and subsequent chemotherapy are still the major therapeutic strategies, with limitation for controlling cancer growth and metastases <xref rid="pone.0115708-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, drug resistance and cancer recurrence are major clinical challenges.</p><p>The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regulates energy generation in mitochondrial respiration and plays a central role in carbohydrate metabolism. Citrate synthase (CS) catalyzes the first reaction of the TCA cycle and is generally assumed to be the rate-limiting enzyme of the cycle <xref rid="pone.0115708-Mukherjee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Increasing evidence suggests that CS activity is closely associated with various kinds of cancers. The activity of citrate synthase was measured using tissue extract prepared from specimens (pancreatic cancer and control specimens taken from the adjacent pancreatic normal tissue) obtained from 24 patients with ductal carcinoma who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatomy, enhanced CS activity was observed in pancreatic cancer <xref rid="pone.0115708-Schlichtholz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is likely that enhanced citrate synthase activity contributes to the conversion of glucose to lipids in pancreatic cancer providing substrate for membrane lipids synthesis. In an in-vitro model, Ramos cells (Burkitt lymphoma cell line) were exposed to varying concentrations of doxorubicin and vincristine for 1 hr; and allowing for recovery in culture over a 7-day period, recovering or residual cells from chemotoxicity exhibited an increase in citrate synthase <xref rid="pone.0115708-Kusao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. All these suggested CS play an essential role in tumors.</p><p>The activity of CS in ovarian cancer has been studied previously. Anderson et al. used the mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cancer progression model to study metabolic changes in distinct disease stages, they found citrate synthase activity was increased during the ovarian cancer progression <xref rid="pone.0115708-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, however, the expression of CS in human ovarian tissues was not investigated. In current study, based on observation that high expression of CS in malignant ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that CS might contribute to the ovarian cancer phenotype as well as drug resistance and thus represent a therapeutic target. We evaluated the consequences of transient <italic>CS</italic> inactivation by silencing the <italic>CS</italic> gene in SKOV3 and A2780 ovarian cancer cell lines. Here, we provided the first demonstration that inactivation of CS result in defective cell proliferation, cellular invasion, migration, and increased chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer cells. Additionally, microarray analysis of <italic>CS</italic>-inactivated cells identified several candidate genes that might promote tumor chemosensitivity, apoptosis, and autophagy.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggested that CS play an important role in regulation of ovarian cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and chemoresistance and indicated that inhibition of CS could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Tumor specimens and Ethics Statement</title><p>A total of 32 tissue specimens were collected from surgical patients enrolled in the study, including 21 primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues and 11 benign ovarian tumor tissues.
