Known risk factors contributing to prolapse are childbirth, collagen abnormalities, increasing age and a chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Around 10% of women undergo surgery at some time in their lives for the management of prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In general, treatment options for patients with symptomatic POP include, beside expectant management, primarily pessary placement and surgical repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. On the one hand, prolapse surgery reduces pelvic floor symptoms by restoring the anatomy of the vagina and the surrounding visceral organs; on the other hand, there are significant cost implications and surgical complications can also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Besides, pessaries have been used as conservative treatment alternatives for POP and 50% of women will choose and continue on pessary therapy as an alternative to surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Abdool et al. as well as Lone et al. reported in their prospective studies similar improvements in both groups regarding urinary and bowel symptoms, sexual function and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Regarding the choice of treatment, patients&#x02019; preference plays a very important role. However, gynaecologists do not know why patients initially choose pessary over surgical or expectant management. Better understanding in this field of treatment decision could help the clinician in better counselling and guide the patient to the right individual treatment decision.</p><p id="Par6">The aim of our study was to evaluate if the clinical factors influence patients&#x02019; treatment choice and to define the potential parameters for surgical therapy decision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par7">This study includes 510 women treated according to their preference and our investigation was conducted at the Department of General Gynaecology and Gynaecologic Oncology, Medical University of Vienna (MUV) with recruitment between January 2013 (when the POP database was initiated) and January 2018. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Medical University of Vienna (EK No. 2184/2017) and all participants gave written, informed consent. Eligible cases were women referred to our tertiary referral urogynaecology unit for dominant POP symptoms and who wished for treatment. Exclusion criteria to participate were pelvic organ prolapse&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;POP-Q stage II, prolapse previously treated with pessary, predominant symptoms of urinary incontinence, contraindication against operative treatment, contraindication against pessary treatment, cancer, vaginal bleeding of unclear history and unable to read and sign informed consent. Following characteristics were assessed for each patient: age, menopausal status, weight, height, blood pressure, current medication, presence of hypertension or COPD, history of POP, POP-Q stage, Oxford Scale, parity, mode of delivery, smoking and loss of urine. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by the formula: weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m). Polypharmacy was defined as the concurrent use of more than five medications by a patient. Clinical information, including follow-up data, was obtained from the database of the Department of General Gynaecology and Gynaecologic Oncology. All patient records were pseudoanonymized and de-identified prior to analysis.</p><p id="Par8">A thorough history was taken and physical examination was conducted for all patients with verified POP including a standardised urogynaecologic interview and a complete vaginal and pelvic examination. This included a urogynaecologic examination to check for genital prolapse according to ICS POP-Q system and controlled provocation with 300&#x000a0;ml saline in the bladder according to the International Continence Society. Furthermore, physical examination included the assessment of pelvic floor strength by the Oxford Grading Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Subsequent to physical examination all women were counselled by one consultant of the core team of urogynaecology and offered prolapse treatment either with pessary placement or surgical correction. Counselling was performed in a non-directive manner, explaining and offering a patient either conservative or surgical treatment as possible treatment options. After this information patients could choose their treatment plan by themselves and were classified into two groups according to their own treatment preference: surgical group versus pessary group.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pessary treatment</title><p id="Par10">According to the assessment of the gynaecologist, a ring, cube or donut pessary was fitted. Stage of prolapse (assessed according to POP-Q system) influenced the choice of pessary type. Pessary fitting was performed at the outpatient clinic, pessary size and type were recorded. After placement all the patients received instructions about pessary handling treatment. Local oestrogen therapy was used in combination with pessary only in postmenopausal women. Follow-up visit was planned 1&#x000a0;week after insertion and afterwards every 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;months at the outpatient clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Prolapse surgery</title><p id="Par11">Surgical intervention consisted of correction of all the affected compartments and the decision which technique was used was left to the discretion of the gynaecologist.

Coolen et al., for example, compared the functional outcomes after pessary treatment and after prolapse surgery and found no difference in prolapse domain scores after 12&#x000a0;months between the two groups. However, similar to our results, the authors reported that the pessary group was significantly older than the surgical group. Furthermore, their data revealed that all women in the pessary group had higher POP-Q stages in the anterior and posterior compartments but no patients with stage IV prolapse were included in the surgery group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is not in line with our results as we detected significant higher prolapse stages in the surgery group and an advanced prolapse stage remained an independent factor for patient&#x02019;s surgical treatment decision.</p><p id="Par22">Some authors reported that women treated either with pessary or surgery demonstrate similar improvements in urinary and bowel symptoms, sexual function and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although POP surgery may have some advantages over pessary treatment in some cases, the risk of complications is higher in the surgical group and it might be more cost intensive.</p><p id="Par23">Nevertheless, patients&#x02019; treatment preference plays an important role, especially in the willingness to try a pessary. Previous studies have shown strong patients&#x02019; preference for one or the other of two interventions. Lamers et al. found that the likelihood of choosing pessary over surgery increases with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, they reported that surgery is preferred over pessary as POP-Q stage increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is in line with our results. Interestingly, in our study population, the distribution of pessary and surgery was well balanced as 51% of our cases chose vaginal pessary and 49% decided for a surgical correction. One may hypothesise that patients&#x02019; counselling was performed in a similar way by the involved doctors. In contrast, a study performed by Wang et al. showed a clear counselling preference to surgical correction as 68% of women chose surgery and only 33% decided for pessary in the study reported by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the authors found that women in the surgical group had higher BMI, age, and longer disease duration than those in the pessary group. Our results could not detect any differences regarding age, BMI, parity and mode of delivery between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par24">We are aware of the limitations of our study. Since this is not a randomised controlled trial (RCT), selection bias might play a role. One cannot completely rule out that doctors might have counselled patients differently depending on their clinical characteristics and their own preference. However, due to our counselling strategy (non-directive manner), this fact seems to have little impact on our clinical findings. Furthermore, RCT is difficult to initiate and it is important to mention that patients&#x02019; treatment preference and autonomy in treatment decision are of great significance in prolapse management. In this study, patients&#x02019; counselling was performed in a similar way by all the involved urogynaecologists and all women had the option to choose their treatment according to their own preference. Although future prospective research is still needed, this clinical study improves the scarce literature on clinical parameters that influence patients&#x02019; treatment decision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par25">In our opinion, patients&#x02019; autonomy in prolapse treatment decision is of great importance and we should respect patients&#x02019; preference of therapy. Our data indicate that women with higher POP-Q stage and non-smokers tended to choose prolapse surgery. This information could help in clinical practice to guide patients for best possible treatment decision and strengthen individual counselling. Future studies will be needed to confirm our results and to define potential parameters for surgical treatment decision.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Open access funding provided by Medical University of Vienna.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>BB-A: data collection, project development, manuscript writing and editing, and data administration.
