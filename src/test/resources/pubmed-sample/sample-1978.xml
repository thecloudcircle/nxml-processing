Here, we explored whether the regulation of c-Kit and plasma membrane prohibitin (PHB) affects ovarian cancer stemness and chemotherapy resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Mass spectrum analysis and an in vitro kinase assay were conducted to examine the phosphorylation of PHB at tyrosine 259 by c-Kit. The in vitro effects of c-Kit on membrane raft-PHB in ovarian cancer were determined using tissue microarray (TMA)-based immunofluorescence, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, colony and spheroid formation, cell migration and cell viability assays. In vivo tumor initiation and carboplatin treatment were conducted in nude mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We found that c-Kit and PHB colocalized in the raft domain and were positively correlated in human ovarian serous carcinoma. c-Kit interacted with PHB and facilitated the phosphorylation of PHB at tyrosine 259 (phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup>) in the membrane raft to enhance ovarian cancer cell motility. The generation of SKOV3GL-G4, a metastatic phenotype of SKOV3 green fluorescent protein and luciferase (GL) ovarian cancer cells, in xenograft murine ascites showed a correlation between metastatic potential and stem cell characteristics, as indicated by the expression of c-Kit, Notch3, Oct4, Nanog and SOX2. Further study revealed that after activation by c-Kit, raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> interacted with Notch3 to stabilize Notch3 and increase the downstream target PBX1. Downregulation of raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> increased the protein degradation of Notch3 through a lysosomal pathway and inhibited the &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02014;ABCG2 signaling pathway. Moreover, raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> played an important role in ovarian cancer stemness and tumorigenicity as well as resistance to platinum drug treatment in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These findings thus reveal a hitherto unreported interrelationship between c-Kit and PHB as well as the effects of raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> on ovarian cancer stemness and tumorigenicity mediated by the Notch3 and &#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathways. Targeting the c-Kit/raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> axis may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating patients with ovarian cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>c-Kit</kwd><kwd>Prohibitin</kwd><kwd>Notch3</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2;-catenin</kwd><kwd>Cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>Lipid raft domain of plasma membrane</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 105-2320-B-001-024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Shu-Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par26">Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among all gynecological malignancies because of its late diagnosis and high recurrence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although the standard therapy of cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy usually results in remission, more than 70% of patients relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Exploring the molecular mechanism to develop approaches to prevent ovarian tumor recurrence is an unmet clinical need.</p><p id="Par27">One promising approach is to study the survival signaling pathways of tumor initiating cancer stem cells (CSCs) that possess the ability to self-renew, differentiate and regenerate tumors in vivo. These CSCs are generally resistant to conventional cancer therapies and are positively regulated in tumor metastasis and recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Hence, targeting CSCs could improve current cancer treatment and help decrease the rate of ovarian cancer relapse. The most commonly used markers for the isolation of ovarian cancer CSCs are CD44, CD133, CD24, CD117 (c-Kit) and ALDH1A1, which are often used in combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, pluripotent stem cell markers of normal stem cells, notably OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, have also been found to play an important role in ovarian cancer development and metastasis and can be used to verify cell stemness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Seventy percent of epithelial ovarian cancers are high-grade serous adenocarcinomas, which often contain ascites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The accumulation of malignant ascites in the peritoneal cavity provides a microenvironment favorable for the formation of spheroids that are enriched in stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, abnormal c-Kit overexpression but not c-Kit mutations have been observed in ovarian serous carcinoma and correlated with a shorter survival time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has been found that c-Kit can mediate drug resistance and play an important role in regulating ovarian tumor-initiating cell survival and proliferation through the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin&#x02014;ABCG2 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Stem cell factor (SCF) binds to c-Kit to activate PI3K/Akt, SRC, PLC&#x003b3;1, JAK/STAT, RAS/MAP kinase, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and Notch pathways, which drive the proliferation, survival, migration and stemness phenotype of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, whether c-Kit needs other cofactor(s) or mediator(s) to activate these pathways is unclear.</p><p id="Par29">Prohibitin (PHB, also known as PHB1) is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein localized to different cellular compartments, including the lipid raft of the plasma membrane, mitochondria, cytoplasm or nucleus, and has diverse biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In A549 lung cancer cells, an increase in surface PHB expression has been shown to prevent the apoptosis of cancer cells and render them more resistant to paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It has also been found that overexpression of PHB results in resistance to diverse chemotherapeutic drugs in Wilms&#x02019; tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In neuroblastoma, PHB regulates cancer cell self-renewal and clonogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our lab previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of PHB at Y259 (phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup>) and T258 (phospho-PHB<sup>T258</sup>) in the lipid raft of the plasma membrane activates Raf-1, which subsequently activates ERK and promotes cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> regulates phospho-PHB<sup>T258</sup> but not vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, it is unclear which tyrosine kinase facilitates the formation of phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> in the lipid raft domain of the plasma membrane to initiate the biological functions of phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup>.</p><p id="Par30">In this study, we showed that c-Kit associates with PHB to upregulate phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> in the lipid raft of the plasma membrane. There is a positive correlation between c-Kit and phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> in advanced serous ovarian carcinoma. Phosphorylation of PHB by c-Kit promotes ovarian cancer stem cell survival and proliferation through activation of not only the &#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway but also the Notch3 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par31">Imatinib mesylate (sc-202,180, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) was dissolved in double-distilled H<sub>2</sub>O to produce a 100&#x02009;mM stock solution and used to treat cells at different concentrations for 24&#x02009;h.

Based on the score and cut-off, c-Kit was identified as the most likely candidate protein (Suppl. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To verify the prediction, we performed an ADP-Glo kinase assay and showed that c-Kit (&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;ng) phosphorylated PHB in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the increase in luminescence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

A proposed model of c-Kit-induced PHB phosphorylation and activation of the Notch3 and &#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathways is shown in Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>. These findings provide new insight into raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup>-mediated regulation of stemness and chemoresistance phenotypes in ovarian cancer and perhaps other cancers.</p><p id="Par67">Despite many recent advances in ovarian cancer therapies, ultimately, metastatic ovarian cancer still recurs and progresses to incurable lethal disease. Here, we found that phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> in the membrane raft domain acted as an adaptor molecule to initiate and transmit stemness and drug resistance signals in ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition of raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> reduced tumorigenicity and resensitized cancer cells to carboplatin treatment. These results indicate that the c-Kit/raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> axis could play a pivotal role in regulating the chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer towards carboplatin. Further studies focusing on targeting c-Kit/raft-phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par68">In summary, we have shown that the association of c-Kit with PHB upregulated phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> in the lipid raft domain, resulting in subsequent activation of the Notch3&#x02014;PBX1 and &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02014;ABCG2 signaling pathways to increase stemness, tumorigenicity and drug resistance in ovarian cancer. Interventions targeting c-Kit and phospho-PHB<sup>Y259</sup> might be used for screening and development of new targeting therapeutics to treat advanced ovarian cancer and other related diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
