Two affected sons, two unaffected daughters, and their mother underwent detailed ophthalmological assessments including Goldmann perimetry, color vision testing, multimodal imaging and ISCEV-standard electroretinography. Genetic testing consisted of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of known XLRP genes and whole exome sequencing (WES) of known inherited retinal disease genes (RetNet-WES). Variant validation and segregation analysis were performed by Sanger sequencing. The mutational load of the <italic>RHO</italic> variant in the mother was assessed in DNA from leucocytes, buccal cells and hair follicles using targeted NGS. Both affected sons showed signs of classical RP, while the mother displayed patches of hyperautofluorescence on blue light autofluorescence imaging and regional, intraretinal, spicular pigmentation, reminiscent of a carrier phenotype of XLRP. XLRP testing was negative. RetNet-WES testing revealed <italic>RHO</italic> variant c.404G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C p.(Arg135Pro) in a mosaic state (21% of the reads) in the mother and in a heterozygous state in both sons.

RP has a worldwide prevalence of 1:4000, making it a leading cause of visual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In keeping with the differential involvement of the photoreceptor systems, patients with RP usually first display symptoms of night blindness, followed by progressive loss of vision in the midperipheral visual fields. In the later stages of the disease, the cone-rich center is affected as well, with concomitant decline of visual acuity. The age of onset varies greatly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (ADRP, 15&#x02013;25% of cases), autosomal recessive (ARRP, 5&#x02013;20%), or X-linked fashion (XLRP, 5&#x02013;15%). The remainder are mostly simplex cases (30&#x02013;55%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. ADRP patients generally show a milder phenotype, with longer preservation of central vision. The recessive and X-linked forms tend to be more severe in progression.

Analysis of the pedigree can be performed as a first step to discriminate between the different modes of inheritance. In ADRP, vertical transmission can be seen. In such families, the patients often display a similar disease course and comparable clinical manifestations. However, specific cases of ADRP with variable expressivity and non-penetrance have been described. For example, in <italic>PRPF31</italic>-associated ADRP, different patients from the same family with the same mutation can have a variable disease severity or can be even totally asymptomatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In XLRP, affected male individuals usually display a more severe and early-onset phenotype, while most female carriers show either RP characteristics later in life or stay asymptomatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the latter case, thorough functional testing with electroretinography, BAF and fundus imaging, will reveal retinal abnormalities.</p><p id="Par17">In the family reported here, BAF imaging in the mother revealed patches of hyper-autofluorescence randomly distributed and interspersed by normal areas throughout the retina in both eyes. This is a typical finding in female carriers of XLRP, due to X-inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Interocular asymmetry in the female proband was also a clinical aspect suggestive of XLRP. Indeed, 9% of 125 females heterozygous for an <italic>RPGR</italic> mutation show interocular asymmetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Given this clinical presentation and the RP phenotype seen in her sons, genetic testing of the XLRP genes was conducted. However, no mutation was found. Subsequent RetNet-WES analysis in III.1 and his mother II.1 identified a variant in the <italic>RHO</italic> gene c.404G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C p.(Arg135Pro). Interestingly, mosaicism of this variant was shown in the mother II.1, estimated to be 21% on DNA from leukocytes, and heterozygosity was shown in her affected son III.1. Co-segregation of the variant with the disease was shown.</p><p id="Par18">Genetic mosaicism is characterized by two or more sets of cell lines with different genotypes in the same individual, resulting from a postzygotic mutation. A variety of factors, including the biological function of the gene, the intrinsic effect of the mutation, the moment when the mutation occurred, and its tissue distribution will determine the type of mosaicism and its phenotypic consequences. This was demonstrated by Cao et al<italic>.</italic> who investigated the allelic fraction and clinical effects of 120 clinically relevant mosaic single nucleotide variants. They showed that an alternate allele fraction (AAF) of 13&#x02013;24% for mosaic variants in <italic>MTOR</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> could lead to Smith-Kingsmore syndrome, Cowden syndrome 5, and/or megalocephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria syndrome, while a comparable AAF of 16&#x02013;30% for mosaic variants in <italic>CACNA1A</italic> was found in asymptomatic parents of children affected with epileptic encephalopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Mosaicism can lead to a wide spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from pigment variations to neurofibromatosis type I and osteogenesis imperfecta type II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, a few cases of mosaicism in eye-related phenotypes have been reported. In particular, it has been shown that approximately 15% of sporadic retinoblastoma cases are caused by postzygotic <italic>RB1</italic> mutations, that intrafamilial phenotypic variability in aniridia cases can be explained by <italic>PAX6</italic> mosaicism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In 2016, the contribution of <italic>RHO</italic> mutations to ADRP in the Israeli and Palestinian populations was studied. Segregation analysis of a specific RP-causing <italic>RHO</italic> mutation [c.548_638dup p.(Ile214Alafs*147)] revealed that the mutation originated from a mosaic individual who did not show any clinical signs of RP. The degree of mosaicism in this individual was 13%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast, the mosaic individual (II.1) studied here, showed a variable mutation load ranging from 21 to 42% in the different tissues tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Indeed, it has been reported that some pathogenic mosaic variants differ in their abundance depending on the tissue, which may be explained partly by differential negative and positive selective pressures in different tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, a more accurate quantification of mosaicism, even at a lower degree, is possible using deep NGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Individual II.1 had phenotypical signs of sectorial RP and a clearly less severe phenotype than that observed in her affected sons. It therefore seems that when a certain threshold of mutation load in the retina is met, clinical disease becomes manifest. However, it is not possible to know the exact mutation load in the retina and how this would compare with the mutation load in blood cells or other types of cells. While the mutation reported by Beryozkin et al<italic>.</italic> has a predicted loss-of-function effect, with a mutation load expected to be proportional to the amount of gene activity, the mutation identified here is known to have a dominant-negative effect, likely resulting in lost gene activity that is presumably higher than the mutation load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">When counselling mosaicism, the recurrence risk can theoretically be between 0 and 50%, depending on the mutation load in the gametes. In case of somatic mosaicism, the mutation cannot be transmitted to the next generation. In case of germline mosaicism however, a clinically unaffected person can transmit the mutation to an offspring. A combination of both somatic and gonadal mosaicism is also possible. Pre-implantation genetic testing should therefore be discussed as a reproductive option.</p><p id="Par21">In conclusion, we report two male siblings with typical signs of RP and their mother with clinical characteristics highly suggestive for XLRP. While XLRP testing was negative, WES revealed mosaicism of <italic>RHO</italic> variant c.404G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C p.(Arg135Pro) in the mother and heterozygosity of this variant in her affected sons. This study emphasizes that mosaicism for a dominant mutation should be considered in families suggestive of XLRP but testing negative.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the family for their participation in the study.
