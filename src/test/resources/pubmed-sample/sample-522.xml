To identify underlying signalling events and novel factors involved in these processes we screened for genes differentially expressed in human monocytes following their adhesion to and passage through an endothelial monolayer. Functional annotation clustering of the genes identified revealed an overrepresentation of those associated with inflammation/immune response, in particular early monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Among the gene products so far not implicated in monocyte transendothelial migration was the inhibitory immune receptor CD300a. CD300a mRNA and protein levels were upregulated following transmigration and engagement of the receptor by anti-CD300a antibodies markedly reduced monocyte transendothelial migration. In contrast, siRNA mediated downregulation of CD300a in human monocytes increased their rate of migration. CD300a colocalized and cosedimented with actin filaments and, when activated, caused F-actin cytoskeleton alterations. Thus, monocyte transendothelial migration is accompanied by an elevation of CD300a which serves an inhibitory function possibly required for termination of the actual transmigration.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG EXC 1003 and DFG SFB 1009).

In order to reach these sites, leukocytes have to penetrate the vessel wall in a directional manner. This process is governed by a cascade of interactions between leukocyte and endothelial cell surface molecules. Following inflammatory stimulation leukocytes engage in initial, primarily selectin-mediated interactions with the activated endothelium that typically lead to tight adhesive contacts mediated by integrins, whose activity is increased upon stimulation of leukocyte chemokine receptors. Finally leukocytes transverse the endothelial blood vessel lining through a paracellular, in some cases also transcellular, route that requires the activity of several endothelial adhesion molecules such as PECAM, CD99, VE-cadherin and JAM family proteins (for reviews see <xref rid="pone.0073981-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073981-Woodfin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>).</p><p>Different signaling pathways are triggered in migrating leukocytes upon interaction with endothelial cells (for reviews see <xref rid="pone.0073981-Ley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-vanBuul1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Imhof1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Zarbock1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). Activation of these signaling cascades is associated with leukocyte cell polarization and directional movement, which collectively support migration on and finally through the endothelial cell layer. In addition, the engagements of integrins and other adhesion receptors have been linked to the regulation of leukocyte gene expression and mRNA stability <xref rid="pone.0073981-deFougerolles1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Rossetti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The genes affected range from transcription factors, metabolic enzymes and kinases to cell adhesion molecules. Some of these gene expression changes contribute to leukocyte differentiation <xref rid="pone.0073981-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and, consequently, leukocyte functions in the inflamed tissue (for an overview see <xref rid="pone.0073981-Nourshargh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>). Gene expression changes have also been analyzed specifically in monocyte subpopulations following activation of inflammatory migration. Such expression profiles revealed an upregulation of certain chemoattractants, proteases possibly required for migration and pattern recognition receptors <xref rid="pone.0073981-Srivastava1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, following adhesion to naive endothelium primary monocytes have been shown to undergo significant gene expression changes towards a more differentiated phenotype <xref rid="pone.0073981-ThomasEcker1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>To extend these observations we sought to obtain a comprehensive overview of monocyte gene expression regulation during the process of transendothelial migration. This was achieved by recording global gene expression profiles of transmigrated versus stationary control monocytes and led to the identification of 81 up- and 75 downregulated mRNAs showing an expression change of at least 1.8 fold. CD300a was among the upregulated genes. It belongs to the group of inhibitory immune receptors that can act as negative regulators counteracting excessive inflammation. Inhibitory receptors have been first characterized on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells because of their ability to terminate the cytotoxic activity of these cells <xref rid="pone.0073981-Moretta1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Moretta2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. CD300a is a 60-KD type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing a single extracellular Ig domain and three classical ITIM motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. It is expressed in NK cells and cytotoxic T cells but also in monocytes and granulocytes <xref rid="pone.0073981-Cantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Monoclonal antibody-mediated crosslinking had been used to activate the receptor and study functional aspects. In NK cells, such CD300a crosslinking resulted in an inhibition of cytotoxic activity via tyrosin phosphorylation of ITIM motifs and a subsequent recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases <xref rid="pone.0073981-Cantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In mast cells, CD300a engagement inhibited IgE dependent mast cell activity and SCF mediated survival by recruiting SHP-1 and SHIP <xref rid="pone.0073981-Bachelet1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. An inhibitory role of CD300a was also observed in eosinophils where antibody-engagement of the receptor suppressed the effect of eotaxin, IL-5, and GM-CSF by recruiting the SHP-1 phosphatase <xref rid="pone.0073981-Munitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, CD300a can modulate the function of some activating receptors such as CD32a in neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0073981-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and kit in mast cells <xref rid="pone.0073981-Bachelet2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Here, we show that an inhibitory role of CD300a also extends to monocyte transendothelial migration since this process is inhibited by antibody-engagement of the receptor. Thus, upregulation of CD300a during transendothelial migration appears to represent a means of fine-tuning monocyte activity and counteracting the migratory stimulation possibly following the actual transendothelial passage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and primary cell isolation, DNA constructs and siRNAs</title><p>HMEC-1 cells were cultivated at 37&#x000b0;C and 3% CO<sub>2</sub> in MCDB-131 medium supplemented with 10% FCS Gold, 20 mM L-glutamine, 50 &#x000b5;g/ml gentamycin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 10 &#x000b5;g/ml hydrocortisone.</p><p>Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from buffy coats <xref rid="pone.0073981-Denholm1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

The monolayer consisted of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) that were seeded on fibronectin-coated polycarbonate filters and used without preactivation by LPS or cytokines/chemokines. Differentially regulated genes were identified by hybridizing cRNA from transmigrated and stationary monocytes to Affymetrix U95Av2 microarrays. On average, 38.2% of the 12599 probe sets found on these microarrays were called present according to the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. Among them, we identified 81 upregulated and 75 downregulated genes showing an average expression change of at least 1.8-fold with p values of less than 0.05 in three independent transmigration and microarray hybridization experiments. The expression changes observed ranged from 14.9-fold down-regulation (IL24) to 9.2-fold up-regulation (VLDLR). A comprehensive list of all genes exhibiting differential expression after adhesion to and migration through an endothelial monolayer is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073981.s004">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073981.s005">S2</xref>.</p><p>In order to confirm the regulations observed in the microarray analysis, we again carried out independent transmigration experiments and subjected 14 of the genes identified in the initial screens to validation by real-time RT-PCR. The genes were chosen to cover a variety of molecular functions, and we only considered the regulation as confirmed if the average regulation in three independent transmigration/RT-PCR experiments matched the direction of regulation observed in the microarray experiments. For 12 of the selected genes we could confirm the direction of regulation found in the microarray experiments (upregulated genes: CD300a, MAP3K8, NT5E, PIK3CB; downregulated genes: AI687419, CCL22, CCR7, FSCN1, GADD45A, RAMP1, RGS2, VNN1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073981-t002">Table 2</xref>).

migration</title><p>Our microarray data revealed a significant (about 3.5 fold) upregulation of the mRNA for the inhibitory immune receptor CD300a in migrated as compared to stationary monocytes. To determine whether the increased CD300a mRNA levels also result in elevated cell surface protein levels, we performed FACS analyses of monocytes before and after transendothelial migration employing monoclonal anti-CD300a antibodies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073981-g001">Figure 1A</xref> reveals that cell surface CD300a levels are also increased following the transendothelial migration of monocytes. Most likely, this increase is not due to translocation to the cell surface of an existing intracellular pool of the receptor, as the total level of CD300a shows a similar increase after transendothelial migration, indicative of new CD300a protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073981-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). CD300a is a cell surface receptor of poorly characterized ligand profile and engagement of CD300a by specific antibodies has been shown to trigger receptor phosphorylation and activation in different haematopoetic cell types <xref rid="pone.0073981-Cantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073981-Munitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore we employed this protocol to investigate a possible role of CD300a in monocyte transendothelial migration. Freshly isolated human monocytes were incubated with mouse anti-CD300a antibodies and allowed to transmigrate across the HMEC-1 monolayer.

We first verified the efficiency of the siRNA treatment in COS-7 cells that were co-transfected with CD300a-GFP and non-targeting or CD300a-targeting siRNAs, respectively. Western blot analysis of cell lysates prepared 24 h post transfection revealed a significant downregulation of CD300a-GFP in cells transfected with the CD300a-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073981.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Next, the efficacy of siRNA-mediated CD300a downregulation was analyzed in monocytes transfected with either control or CD300a-specific siRNAs. Cell surface CD300a was detected by antibody staining two days after transfection revealing a considerable reduction in CD300a levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073981-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Given this significant knockdown of surface CD300a, we subjected the CD300a-depleted monocytes to transendothelial migration 48 hours post transfection and compared the number of transmigrated cells to that of untransfected and control siRNA-transfected monocytes. While transfection with control siRNA led to a slight but statistically non-significant increase in transmigration, siRNA-mediated reduction of CD300a cell surface levels resulted in further increase in the number of transmigrated cells that was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073981-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0073981-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0073981.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>siRNA-mediated downregulation of CD300a increases monocyte transendothelial migration.</title><p>

Therefore, towards understanding the mechanistic basis of CD300a action in monocyte transmigration we analyzed by subcellular localization studies whether CD300a could directly or indirectly associate with the actin cytoskeleton. Since details of cytoskeletal structures are difficult to visualize in peripheral blood monocytes, experiments were first carried out with COS-7 cells ectopically expressing CD300a. Staining with phalloidin and anti-CD300a antibodies revealed a partial colocalization of CD300a with F-actin, in particular along the cell surface and in actin-rich protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073981-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). It is noteworthy that CD300a localized to such structures but did not induce them, since they are also apparent in untransfected cells. Interestingly, localization of CD300a to actin-rich protrusions was increased following engagment of the receptor with anti-CD300a antibodies. On the other hand, treatment of the cells with cytochalasin D abolished the CD300a- and actin-rich protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073981-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). An interaction of CD300a with F-actin was also evident in actin co-sedimentation assays performed with lysates of cells ectopically expressing CD300a. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073981-g005">Figure 5C</xref> reveals a significant co-pelleting of CD300a with actin filaments in extracts from transfected cells.</p><fig id="pone-0073981-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0073981.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>CD300a associates with F-actin in COS-7 cells.</title><p>

Monocytes which were treated with the anti-CD300a antibodies showed a larger and flatter morphology with extended lamellipodia.

In line with this, our functional annotation clustering analysis of genes differentially expressed in transmigrated monocytes revealed the highest enrichment score for genes associated with inflammation/immune response. Some of the differentially regulated genes have well-known functions in monocyte-mediated immune responses, such as the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) (see, for example, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Arend1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Others, however, are known to play a role in inflammation in general, but have not yet been characterized in monocytes. One such example is CD300a, which is an inhibitory receptor in human NK cells <xref rid="pone.0073981-Cantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and eosinophils <xref rid="pone.0073981-Munitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> but is also expressed in other leukocytes and was chosen here for further analysis with respect to its potential role in monocyte transmigration.</p><p>Our microarray analysis also identified several transcription factors and proteins that modulate transcription factor activity among the differentially expressed genes. These include members of the NR4A nuclear hormone receptor subfamily, NR4A2 and NR4A3, which are known to modulate inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0073981-Bonta1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and the human myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) <xref rid="pone.0073981-Briggs1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The latter had been implicated in myeloid cell differentiation, although its functional role in this process is unclear <xref rid="pone.0073981-Asefa1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In line with such role of MNDA we obtained additional evidence that transendothelial migration triggered early steps of monocyte differentiation. Comparison of the transcription profile of transmigrated monocytes with that observed upon monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated U937 cells or cytokine-treated human peripheral blood monocytes <xref rid="pone.0073981-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Verhoeckx1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> revealed that the regulation of several genes, e.g. CCR7, DEFA1, IL1RN, IL15, INDO and SPP1, is common in both scenarios. Thus, altogether our profiling strengthens the hypothesis that human peripheral blood monocytes start differentiating into macrophages already during or immediately after transendothelial migration.</p><p>Inhibitory receptors such as CD300a play critical roles in the regulation of different immune cell functions. Loss of inhibitory signalling is often associated with auto-reactivity and excessive inflammatory responses indicating the important role of such inhibitory systems and identifying them as potential targets for the treatment of immune disorders <xref rid="pone.0073981-Bachelet2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Tam1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We show here that CD300a is upregulated during monocyte transendothelial migration not only at the RNA but also at the cell surface protein level. How does this translate to a potential function in monocyte extravasation? In line with an inhibitory role of CD300a, its engagement by specific antibodies inhibits the transendothelial migration of monocytes. This inhibitory effect is similar to that elicited by anti-CD300a antibody engagement on the migration of eosinophils in response to eotaxin <xref rid="pone.0073981-Munitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Antibody engagement could induce receptor endocytosis and thereby reduce cell surface levels of CD300a that normally might be required for efficient transmigration. Indeed, the mouse homologue of CD300a (MAIRI/CML-8) contains a YVNL sequence in its cytoplasmic part that is involved in internalization <xref rid="pone.0073981-Yotsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and an internalization motif is also found in the cytoplasmic domain of human CD300a <xref rid="pone.0073981-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Therefore, we analysed a possible CD300a internalization following receptor engagement. However, FACS analysis showed no difference in surface expression of CD300a before and after antibody engagement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073981.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, we exclude a possible reduction of cell surface CD300a levels in response to antibody treatment in our experiments.</p><p>In order to pass through the vessel wall, monocytes need to change their shape, a process accompanied by major cytoskeletal rearrangements <xref rid="pone.0073981-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Correlations between inhibitory receptors and actin cytoskeleton dynamics have been reported but are not yet known for CD300a <xref rid="pone.0073981-Krzewski1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073981-ToyamaSorimachi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our study reveals for the first time such a relation between CD300a and the actin cytoskeleton. CD300a localizes to actin-rich protrusions that are also positive for ezrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073981.s003">Figure S3</xref>), a protein known to connect membrane receptors to the actin cytoskeleton (for review see <xref rid="pone.0073981-Fehon1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>). Hence, ezrin might serve as a linker between cell surface CD300a and underlying cortical actin, thereby physically translating CD300a engagement to changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Other, more indirect links between CD300a and the regulation of actin dynamics can also be envisaged. Engagement of CD300a results in phosphorylation of its ITIMs and the recruitment of SHP phosphatases <xref rid="pone.0073981-Munitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This could affect actin dynamic because it has been shown that actin is a direct SHP-1 substrate in B cells <xref rid="pone.0073981-Baba1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. BCR crosslinking using specific mAbs results in SHP-1 recruitment and subsequent actin dephosphorylation and F-actin depolymerization. Moreover, Vav1, which is an important regulator of actin dynamics, is also a direct substrate of SHP-1 <xref rid="pone.0073981-Stebbins1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, and its dephosphorylation could represent an important event downstream of CD300a engagement. Alternatively, a physical connection between CD300a and cortical actin might be necessary for the proper recruitment of phosphatases to activated CD300a, similar to what has been observed for FC&#x003b3;RIIB in mast cells <xref rid="pone.0073981-Lesourne1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Here, the interaction of FC&#x003b3;RIIB with actin has been shown to be required for enhancing the negative regulatory effect of this receptor towards FC&#x003b5;RI <xref rid="pone.0073981-Lesourne1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The role of actin in this case has been assumed to be that of a scaffold protein stabilizing the SHIP-1-FC&#x003b3;RIIB interaction.</p><p>As all these receptor-actin interactions appear to negatively regulate cell activities, it is not surprising that antibody engagement of CD300a also has an inhibitory effect on transendothelial migration and that CD300a knockdown increase transmigration. It should be noted, however, that CD300a is upregulated only following adhesion and transendothelial migration and it is likely to act after this step in a physiological scenario. The factor(s) triggering the inhibitory activity of CD300a in this context, i.e. after endothelial passage, remain to be identified. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine exposed on apoptotic cells have been described recently as CD300a ligands and the receptor appears to be involved in modulating the phagocytosis of dead cells <xref rid="pone.0073981-NakahashiOda1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073981-Simhadri1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that upregulation of monocytic CD300a following transendothelial migration prepares the cells for anti-migratory signalling that is initiated when they get in contact with apoptotic cells at the site of inflammation. Future experiments have to address this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0073981.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Efficient Knockdown of CD300a expression.
