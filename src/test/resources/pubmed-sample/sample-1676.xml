Under hypoxic conditions (four weeks at 10% O2) mice develop typical symptoms of PH, characterized by an increased muscularization of arterial blood vessels in the lung. The vessel remodeling can be prevented by the chronic application of 5-HT2B receptor antagonists. We found that hypoxic mice also develop increased sensitivity towards the 5-HT2 receptor agonist meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP). In contrast to the control group (normoxic mice kept at 20% O2) at low doses of 1 &#x000b5;g / kg body weight, mCPP triggers plasma protein extravasation (PPE) in the dura mater in hypoxic mice. Dural PPE is a quantifiable indicator of migraine-like events in animal models.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The sensitization towards mCPP may coincide with structural remodeling processes in arterial blood vessels of the dura mater, possibly exhibiting similarities to vascular alterations in the lung. A prerequisite in the investigation of vascular alterations in the dura mater is a thorough understanding of the normal organization of dural vasculature in mice and of the extent of its normal biological variance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Histological examinations of the length of dural vessels were performed to quantify and statistically analyze inter- and intraindividual differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Interindividual differences: The arteriole total lengths are 15% far from the arithmetic mean.</p><p>Intraindividual differences: The difference in the length of arterioles represents 12% of the total length of the arterioles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>On the basis of these results examinations of dural vessel of hypoxic mice can be investigated.</p><p>No conflict of interest.</p></sec></body></article>
