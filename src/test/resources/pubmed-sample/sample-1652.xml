Its activity depends on correct intracellular trafficking and on synaptic membrane insertion. Here, we describe that in hippocampal neurons the synapse-associated protein-97 (SAP97), an excitatory synapse scaffolding element, governs ADAM10 trafficking from dendritic Golgi outposts to synaptic membranes. This process is mediated by a previously uncharacterized protein kinase C phosphosite in SAP97 SRC homology 3 domain that modulates SAP97 association with ADAM10. Such mechanism is essential for ADAM10 trafficking from the Golgi outposts to the synapse, but does not affect ADAM10 transport from the endoplasmic reticulum. Notably, this process is altered in Alzheimer's disease brains. These results help in understanding the mechanism responsible for the modulation of ADAM10 intracellular path, and can constitute an innovative therapeutic strategy to finely tune ADAM10 shedding activity towards APP.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Genetic studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) point to risk factor genes encoding proteins with a known function in local trafficking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> With different approaches, the intracellular transport of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), the enzyme responsible for the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-secretase cleavage preventing the formation of amyloid <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in primary neurons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> has also been described.

First, the amino-acid (aa) analysis revealed S741 as a putative PKC phosphorylation site in the ADAM10 domain interacting with SAP97<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup>
<italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays revealed PKC-dependent incorporation of phosphorus-32 (<sup>32</sup>P) only into the wild-type (wt) ADAM10-C-terminal (Ct) domain. Both the sequential deletion mutants of ADAM10 tail and the S741 to A mutant failed to show <sup>32</sup>P incorporation, thus confirming that S741 is a PKC phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b and c</xref>). To assess the role of the identified PKC phosphorylation site in the modulation of ADAM10/SAP97 interaction, we carried out pull-down assays with glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) fusion proteins phosphorylated or not by PKC. Neither the phosphorylation of ADAM10-Ct nor the mutation into A of the PKC phosphosite S741 affects ADAM10 binding to SAP97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2d and e</xref>), suggesting that it is not relevant for the formation of the ADAM10/SAP97 complex.</p><p>In a second step, we investigated whether SAP97 is a PKC substrate, carrying out metabolic labeling experiments with [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate in yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-SAP97wt-transfected COS-7 cells. Autoradiography revealed a specific radioactive band corresponding to YFP-SAP97 in phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)-treated cells samples, showing that SAP97 undergoes PKC phosphorylation in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We tested the presence of PKC phosphorylation sites within different SAP97 domains. GST-SAP97wt and GST-SAP97-SH3 fusion proteins, but not the other deletion mutants, are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Moreover, the deletion mutant GST-SAP97-GK&#x00394; is phosphorylated to the same extent as SAP97wt, demonstrating the absence of relevant PKC phosphosites in the HOOK-GK domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The analysis of the SH3 sequence predicted four PKC consensus motifs (S582, S597, T629 and S642; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays with GST-SAP97wt or S/T to A point mutants at the putative PKC phosphosites showed that both mutations T629 and S642 to A reduced SAP97 phosphorylation, whereas the replacement of S582 and S597 did not significantly affect <sup>32</sup>P incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3e and f</xref>). Consistently, the loss of both T629 and S642 in the GST-SAP97-624&#x00394; deletion mutant lacking the Ct region of SAP97 significantly decreased <sup>32</sup>P incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d, g and h</xref>). To evaluate whether PKC phosphorylation of SAP97 modifies ADAM10/SAP97 interaction, we carried out pull-down assays with GST fusion proteins phosphorylated or not by PKC. The analysis revealed that the phosphorylation of both GST-SAP97wt and GST-SAP97-SH3 significantly increases the association with ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3i and j</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the elimination of both phosphosites in the deletion mutant GST-SAP97-624&#x00394; abolishes the PKC-induced increase in ADAM10 precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3k and l</xref>). However, the mutation of T629 to A, but not the mutation of S642 to A, prevented the PKC-induced increase in ADAM10/SAP97 association, thus indicating that only the T629 phosphorylation site is relevant for the ADAM10/SAP97 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3k and l</xref>). Finally, neither the mutation of the other putative PKC phosphosites nor the HOOK-GK domain deletion influences the PKC-induced ADAM10 binding to SAP97 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Supporting for specificity, PKC phosphorylation of GST-SAP97wt and of the single mutants lacking SH3 phosphosites did not alter the binding to other SAP97 partners, that is A-kinase anchor protein 150 (AKAP150), GluA1 and GluN2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 1C&#x02013;E</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that SAP97 phosphorylation at T629 positively modulates ADAM10/SAP97 interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of T629 influences SAP97 structure</title><p>To explore further how SAP97 T629 phosphorylation influences ADAM10/SAP97 binding, we carried out a modeling study.</p><p>The 3D structure of the SH3-GK domains of the SAP97 protein was recently solved by x-ray crystallography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> The SH3 domain of SAP97 is formed by five <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-strands and has been defined as a &#x02018;splitted' SH3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> because of a peculiar feature: strand <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>5 is located after an intervening domain called HOOK domain and not contiguous in sequence with the other four strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> T629 is located at the beginning of the so-called &#x02018;distal loop' that connects strands <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>4, whereas S642 is found at the beginning of the HOOK domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>).</p><p>The phosphorylated site T629 was modeled in the 3D structure of the SAP97-SH3 domain subsequently energy minimized. As expected, the introduction of the charged phosphate group causes a change in the electrostatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c and d</xref>). The major differences in the electrostatic potential are located in the RT and distal loops of the SAP97-SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c and d</xref>). Inspection of the minimized structure suggests that the phosphorylation allows the formation of an electrostatic interaction of the phosphate with K607 located on the RT loop, an interaction that cannot be established in the absence of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c and d</xref>). This is expected to increase the rigidity of the RT loop, involved in the interaction with other molecular partners, as ADAM10.</p><p>To verify this hypothesis, molecular dynamics simulations of 10&#x02009;ns each were carried out for the SAP97-SH3 complex in the presence and absence of the T629 phosphorylation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref> shows the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculated for the RT and distal loop in the presence and absence of the T629 phosphorylation. In the absence of the phosphate group, the two loops are mobile and assume different conformations increasing the structural flexibility of the interaction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Upon phosphorylation, the structure of the SH3 domain becomes more rigid, in particular at the level of the RT and distal loops that are locked in a defined conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4e and f</xref>). The rigidity of these loops affects the structure of the binding site specific for the PxxP motif.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> shows the structures of 15 different SH3 domains cocrystallized with different partners and superimposed to the snapshots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>. All the peptides cocrystallized with the SH3 domains are in direct contact with strands <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>4 and with the RT loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), which, therefore, potentially represents the binding site for ADAM10.</p><p>Considering these results, the phosphorylation of T629 is expected to mainly affect the RT loop. As a consequence, the SAP97 binding site assumes a more rigid conformation leading to a stronger interaction with the Ct region of ADAM10.</p></sec><sec><title>The phosphorylation of SAP97 at T629 has a functional and pathological role</title><p>ADAM10/SAP97 interaction is reduced in AD patients' hippocampi at Braak 4, suggesting a SAP97 cargo dysfunction in the pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Therefore, we asked whether an alteration of PKC phosphorylation at the residue T629 of SAP97 could be responsible for the decrease in ADAM10/SAP97 association in AD patients.</p><p>To this, a phospho-specific antibody (Ab) raised against T629 (SAP97-T629P Ab) was produced, affinity purified and tested for specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed the levels of SAP97 phosphorylation at T629 in hippocampi from AD patients at Braak 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and from age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Total homogenates from hippocampi of HCs and AD patients were IP with SAP97-T629P Ab and total SAP97 was evaluated. Quantitative analysis showed a significant reduction in SAP97 phosphorylation in AD hippocampi when compared with HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a and b</xref>). The IP was specific as no signal was detected in the absence of the phospho-Ab (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). As previously demonstrated, SAP97 total levels were not affected by the sample group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup></p><p>To verify whether genetic modulation of ADAM10/SAP97 interaction might occur, 100 AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> were recruited, and genetic polymorphism within the SH3 domain of SAP97 evaluated. No genetic variations within the SH3 domain of SAP97 were detected in AD patients, suggesting that other cellular mechanisms might be responsible for the decreased PKC phosphorylation of SAP97 at T629 in AD.</p><p>Because SAP97 regulates ADAM10 synaptic membrane localization and activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> we tested whether this specific phosphorylation could have a role in controlling ADAM10 activity. Soluble amyloid precursor protein &#x003b1; (sAPP&#x003b1;) release was significantly increased when HEK293 cells stably expressing human APP were transfected with YFP-SAP97wt. However, sAPP&#x003b1; levels further increased when cells expressed a mutant mimicking the phosphorylation of SAP97 at T629 (YFP-SAP97-T629D), but not at S642 (YFP-SAP97-S642D), indicating that T629 phosphorylation specifically boosts ADAM10 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5c and d</xref>).</p><p>Further, COS-7 cells were transfected with ADAM10 alone or co-transfected with either YFP-SAP97wt or the phosphomimetic mutants. Coexpression of SAP97 yields a nearly twofold increase in ADAM10 surface levels. Yet, cells expressing SAP97 mutated in T629, but not in S642, display a stronger ADAM10 surface labeling when compared with SAP97wt-transfected cells. Quantitative analysis confirmed that SAP97 phosphorylation at T629, but not at S642, significantly increases ADAM10 surface/total levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5e and f</xref>).</p><p>These data indicate a functional role of the PKC-dependent SAP97 phosphorylation at T629 in the regulation of ADAM10 localization/activity and an involvement of this process in AD.</p></sec><sec><title>PKC activation induces SAP97-mediated ADAM10 trafficking from the Golgi outposts to the postsynaptic density</title><p>Based on these findings, we investigated how the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97 influences ADAM10 trafficking in neuronal cells.</p><p>To analyze ADAM10 and SAP97 distribution along the secretory pathway, we purified TIF and microsomal fraction (P3), enriched in the Golgi and ER proteins, from hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>).

This mechanism has a pathogenic role, as we observed a significant reduction of SAP97 phosphorylation in AD patients, which can be responsible for the previously reported defect in ADAM10 synaptic trafficking and activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Finally, we showed that ADAM10 trafficking implies transit through dendritic Golgi outposts where ADAM10/SAP97 complex formation occurs.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that PKC activation fosters ADAM10 forward trafficking towards the postsynapse inducing ADAM10 exit from the ER.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> We showed that PKC stimulation leads to a reduced ER/Golgi ADAM10 localization and to a concomitant increase in the enzyme levels in the PSD.</p><p>We have evaluated in parallel the localization of SAP97, previously found to be enriched in ER, where it has been proposed to convey AMPA (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, SAP97 has been identified as a binding partner and substrate for PKC and is also required for PKC-dependent stimulation of cell migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Imaging analysis revealed that PKC activation reduces SAP97 localization in both somatic Golgi and dendritic Golgi outposts.</p><p>Golgi outposts are considered to be an extension of the somatic Golgi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> or a site of biosynthesis for integral membrane proteins translated from dendritically localized mRNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> As SAP97 has been previously shown to be required for NMDARs trafficking via a non-conventional secretory pathway that uses dendritic Golgi outposts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> we asked whether ADAM10/SAP97 complex also transits through this compartment.</p><p>When we interfere with ADAM10/SAP97 complex formation, using the cell-permeable Pro peptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> ADAM10 fails to be delivered to the synapse and accumulates in dendritic Golgi outposts, suggesting that ADAM10 associates with SAP97 in this subcellular compartment.</p><p>Moreover, uncoupling ADAM10 and SAP97 prevents the PKC-triggered ADAM10 transport from Golgi outposts to the PSD without affecting enzyme sorting via the ER-somatic Golgi conventional path. Therefore, ADAM10/SAP97 interaction is necessary for the PKC-induced ADAM10 trafficking via the non-conventional secretory pathway, which may provide a platform for local control of ADAM10 insertion in the synapse, thus enabling neurons to more tightly and locally regulate its activity.</p><p>Furthermore, we found out that PKC activation positively modulates ADAM10 association to SAP97. Although it turned out that both ADAM10 and SAP97 are PKC substrates, only PKC phosphorylation of SAP97 affects ADAM10/SAP97 complex formation. We identified T629 within SAP97-SH3 domain as a novel PKC phosphosite, whose phosphorylation entails an increased interaction with ADAM10. Noteworthy, SAP97 T629 phosphorylation does not affect the interaction with other SAP97 binding partners, ruling out the chance that this posttranslational modification generally influences SAP97 binding capability. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that T629 phosphorylation leads to a more rigid conformation of the SAP97 binding site and, thereby, is likely to mediate a stronger interaction with the ADAM10 cytoplasmic tail.</p><p>The phosphorylation of SAP97 T629 has important implications for ADAM10 activity because it affects ADAM10 membrane levels and, in turn, APP cleavage. In heterologous systems, the overexpression of the SAP97-T629D mutant, which mimics phosphorylation, fosters ADAM10 transport to the plasma membrane and increases sAPP<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> release. Then, imaging studies revealed that the phosphorylation of SAP97 T629 specifically promotes ADAM10 transport from Golgi outposts to the postsynaptic compartment. Conversely, the loss of this specific PKC phosphosite causes ADAM10 accumulation in Golgi outposts and decreases its synaptic levels.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that the reduction of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-secretase activity is central in early stages of AD pathogenesis and is a consequence of a failure in ADAM10 exocytosis/endocytosis processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Here we describe a significant decrease in PKC-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97 T629 in AD patients' hippocampi, an outcome in line with previous studies revealing that AD patients have lower levels of PKC activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Moreover, this alteration is not associated with the presence of genetic variations in the SH3 domain of SAP97.</p><p>These results add another tile to our understanding of the complex intracellular cascade of events responsible for the defective ADAM10 trafficking and APP cleavage in AD neurons. Whether ADAM10 forward trafficking and endocytosis are independent pathways or act synergistically to the development of defective APP cleavage still remains to be understood.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated that reduction of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-secretase activity can cause AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Moreover, a modest elevation of ADAM10 activity may be beneficial for AD and is well tolerated in adult brain, supporting the hypothesis that therapeutic strategies for increasing <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-secretase activity via ADAM10 upregulation are predicted to be efficacious for AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup></p><p>Hence, our findings provide a neuron-specific mechanistic framework according to which ADAM10 dendritic trafficking from Golgi outposts to the synapse and its shedding activity are under the control of the phosphorylation of SAP97 T629 by PKC.

We fused the C terminus of ADAM10 to the energy donor <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (ADAM10-Rluc) and the N terminus of SAP97 to the acceptor YFP (YFP-SAP97).
