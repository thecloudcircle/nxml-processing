The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the role of device insertion (ab interno versus ab externo) on the outflow resistance of a subconjunctival drainage device.

A microfluidic approach was used, consisting of a reservoir of water connected to a pressure pump/flow sensor (Fluigent, Villejuif, France). The flow rate of water was fixed at 2 &#x003bc;L/min to simulate aqueous humor production, and the initial pressure to generate this flow rate was between 10 and 15 mm Hg to mimic normal IOP levels in human subjects. This was achieved by altering the length and diameter of the PEEK tube used in the microfluidic setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Measurements of the outflow resistance before insertion into the eye were taken and this formed the baseline measurement for each eye.

A superior limbal conjunctival incision was created with Vanna scissors. Blunt dissection with Westcott scissors was performed to the level of the sclera and extended laterally and posteriorly. An 18G (green) cannula was used to create a channel through the center of the cornea, into the anterior chamber and exiting through the drainage angle into the subconjunctival space 3 mm posterior to the limbus. The cannula needle was exchanged for a 1/32-in outer diameter PEEK tube (internal diameter, 125 &#x003bc;m). The cannula was also removed, leaving the PEEK tube in situ running through the cornea and anterior chamber into the subconjunctival space, with the sclera forming a surrounding tight seal around the tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f01">Fig. 1C</xref>). This approach was assessed using blue dye to observe for any wound leak, and we did not observe any leakage of fluid into the anterior chamber or via the conjunctival incision made with the ab externo approach. Conjunctival closure was performed with 10/0 nylon (Ethilon, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). The ab interno approach (<italic>n</italic> = 12) was performed in a similar fashion to the ab externo approach but without dissection and subsequent closure of the conjunctiva.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The experiments on each eye were conducted for 6 hours, and the pressure was recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz.

Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant difference between the two approaches by using an unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). It was observed that although the resulting subconjunctival bleb following the ab externo approach tended to match the area of dissection created using Westcott scissors, the bleb was smaller and more variable following the ab interno approach. Once an outflow pathway was established at baseline and following insertion of the PEEK tubing via the ab interno or ab externo approach, there was minimal variation in data recording for each individual eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f03">Fig. 3</xref>). However, it was also observed that in several ab interno eyes, the IOP peaked to levels greater than 21 mm Hg on several occasions, with each peak getting smaller during the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f04">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><fig id="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Graph of outflow resistance adjusted for water viscosity at 37&#x000b0;C via the ab interno and ab externo surgical approaches.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f02"/></fig><fig id="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Difference in pressure drop between baseline and after bleb formation in each eye when the device was inserted via an ab externo (left) and ab interno approach (right).

MIGS devices that drain into the subconjunctival space need some form of flow control mechanism because otherwise there is a risk of hypotony. The Xen gel stent and InnFocus microshunt control aqueous humor outflow based on the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, where the outflow resistance is a result of the lumen diameter and tube length.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, whereas the Xen gel stent is designed to provide 6 to 8 mm Hg of resistance at an aqueous flow rate of 1.2 &#x003bc;L/min, reported outcomes at 1 year are far greater at levels closer to 15 mm Hg, which would suggest that there are factors other than just the device lumen dimensions that affect clinical outcomes.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The IOP levels obtained following Xen gel stent insertion are also greater than those obtained with the InnFocus microshunt.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>One of the most significant differences between the two devices is the method of insertion. MIGS was a term that was initially coined for devices that were inserted via an ab interno approach but have since also included devices inserted via an ab externo approach. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. The ab interno approach allows for the insertion of the MIGS device at the time of phacoemulsification surgery, therefore reducing tissue manipulation or the need for sutures. Although preoperative mitomycin C (MMC) can be injected before implantation, it does not have the same control as if it were used in an ab externo approach as per the Moorfields Safer Surgery System.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Therefore, there is a significant risk that the Xen gel stent may not achieve adequate long-term outcomes following implantation due to inadequate optimization of the wound healing response.</p><p>One of the advantages of the ab externo approach is that it requires less manipulation within the anterior chamber than the ab interno approach. The ab externo approach, although requiring conjunctival dissection, allows the surgeon to direct aqueous humor outflow posteriorly in a more predictable fashion than the ab interno approach. Subconjunctival blebs are, therefore, more likely to be diffuse with a lower risk of long-term failure.</p><p>We observed during the study that the resulting blebs following the ab interno approach were smaller and more variable. This may, therefore, play a greater role in controlling IOP, and it was observed that the difference in pressure drop across eyes where the tube was inserted via an ab interno approach was greater and more variable between eyes than via an ab externo approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f03">Fig. 3</xref>). We also noted that in some cases, IOP &#x0201c;spiked&#x0201d; to levels greater than 21 mm Hg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f04">Fig. 4</xref>), whereas this was not observed in any of the cases via the ab externo approach. It was believed that the spikes were due to a valve-like mechanism at the posterior border of the subconjunctival bleb created via the ab interno approach. As fluid drained posteriorly past the bleb, the maximum level of the spikes would decrease and be further apart as bleb formation became more stable and more tissue dissected posteriorly by the preceding spikes. Any sudden changes to the outflow pathway would be observed but would return to baseline. Indeed, changes to the bleb dimensions will result in changes to the bleb volume and it would take significantly longer for outflow resistance to respond to these changes. In one eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-f04">Fig. 4</xref>), it took approximately 20 minutes for the pressure drop to go back to its original value due to the elastic nature of the conjunctiva. Although these spikes are important from an IOP control perspective, they also provide evidence that pursing of the subconjunctival bleb in the early postoperative period may play a role in helping to monitor IOP. We have also performed studies and developed theoretical models that explain how the appearance of subconjunctival blebs in the early postoperative period may be used to develop clinical grading systems to help improve surgical outcomes following surgery (Bouremel Y, et al. <italic>IOVS</italic>. 2017;58:ARVO E-Abstract 5576).<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-3-58-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These pressure spikes did not occur in all eyes, and further studies are currently underway to shed more light on why these results were observed.</p><p>Limitations of the study include that the experiments were performed using ex vivo rabbit eyes. The size of the eye and the tissue will not be the same as a human subject intraoperatively and, therefore, it is difficult to establish for certain the implications of the results obtained. The microfluidic setup and method of implantation are different to that of the current MIGS device and may affect flow parameters, although it should be possible to compare devices based on a cylindrical lumen design given that outflow resistance between devices is governed by lumen length and diameter, respectively. We also did not dissect the conjunctival plane with fluid to simulate the preoperative injection of MMC during the ab interno approach. Although an MMC injection may play a role in altering the tissue plane and, therefore, the effect of the bleb on IOP control compared to if an injection was not used, injections are inherently more random and less predictable than a standardized approach to conjunctival dissection as per an ab externo approach. It is, therefore, likely our observations are similar to those we might expect in vivo, and we believe one of the key findings of our results is the unpredictability of the bleb development with devices implanted via the ab interno approach with preimplantation subconjunctival injection of MMC.</p><p>Although it is likely that the surgical approach is not the only reason why we observed a difference in surgical outcomes, we did find a statistically significant difference in outflow resistance between the two approaches. Further studies are necessary to assess its significance in an in vivo environment and to assess the nature of bleb formation between the two different techniques and IOP control. We believe that these results have implications for long-term postoperative outcomes and could be an important consideration for the development of future MIGS devices.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by the Medical Research Council, Moorfields Special Trustees &#x00026; Moorfields Eye Charity, the Haymans Trust, the Helen Hamlyn Trust in memory of Paul Hamlyn and Fight for Sight (UK) Ron and Liora Moskovitz, John Nolan, Richard Desmond Foundation, and the Michael and Ilse Katz Foundation.
