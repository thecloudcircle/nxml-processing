Among the range of diseases caused by this fungus, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is the life-threatening form of infection and is associated with high mortality rates of 50&#x02013;90% in the currently increasing population of immunocompromised patients (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dagenais and Keller 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Kousha <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The conidia from this fungus are highly abundant and mostly disperse in the air. They can be inhaled by the mammalian host and then reach and colonize the lungs (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kwon-Chung and Sugui 2013</xref>). IPA is a multifactorial disease, given that several <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> virulence determinants and phenotypic traits support the capacity of this organism to cause disease in immunocompromised hosts (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Krappmann 2008</xref>). Some examples of these traits are nutritional versatility, thermotolerance, and the secretion of secondary metabolites including gliotoxin and siderophores (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Goldman 2016</xref>). These features ultimately allow this fungus to adapt and colonize the host&#x02019;s environment and evade its defense mechanisms (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brakhage and Langfelder 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Araujo and Rodrigues 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bhabhra and Askew 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Tekaia and Latge 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Sugui <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Schrettl and Haas 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Haas 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Goldman 2016</xref>).</p><p>The fungal cell wall has been shown to perform multiple roles in virulence because <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> mutants that have deficiencies in cell wall integrity (CWI) have attenuated virulence (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Mouyna <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beauvais <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bom <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Winkelstroter <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bruder Nascimento <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Fungal cell survival is highly dependent on the organization, composition, and function of the cell wall component. This structure is essential for providing an adequate cell shape and integrity to fungal morphotypes, preventing cell lysis. In addition, this structure plays a role in cell-to-cell adhesion and in the prevention of nonself recognition by the host immune system (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Gastebois <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Dirr <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Latge 2010</xref>). As a rigid but dynamic protective barrier, this structure is under constant biosynthesis and remodeling as forced by the inherent processes involved in fungal growth and reproduction (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Klis <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Levin 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Piccirillo <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) or by the multiple environmental challenges that are sensed by the invading pathogen during infection.</p><p>The CWI pathway is a signal transduction cascade that maintains the integrity of the cell wall. The CWI pathway is conserved among fungi and has been studied in many human fungal pathogens including <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs and Mylonakis 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Dirr <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dichtl <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Samantaray <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the CWI pathway is the primary signaling cascade that is activated in response to cell wall stress. Cell wall damage is initially sensed by mechanosensors that are located on the plasma membrane. The signal is transmitted to Pkc1 (the apical kinase in the CWI pathway) through the activity of the small Rho GTPase Rho1 and two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) called Rom1-2 (reviewed in <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Levin 2011</xref>). The Pkc1 module of the circuit comprises a downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling component, which amplifies the CWI signal. The MAPK module of the CWI pathway is a linear three-component kinase consisting of Bck1, two redundant proteins (Mkk1 and Mkk2), and the final kinase known as Mpk1 (Slt2). These proteins are sequentially phosphorylated and activated via the Pkc1-mediated upcoming signal. The activated Mpk1 controls the function of two transcription factors, namely SBF (Swi4/Swi6) and Rlm1, which are responsible for regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle control and cell wall biosynthesis, respectively (<xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Dodou and Treisman 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Gustin <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). However, there is also some interplay between these two transcription factors in CWI signaling (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Madden <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baetz <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).</p><p>Rlm1 is a member of the MADS (Mcm1-Agamous-Deficiens-Serum Response Factor)-box transcription factor family, which controls diverse developmental processes, especially in plants (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Smaczniak <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Yeast and fungal RLM1-related genes are type II MADS-box transcription factors, which also include the human MEF2 (Myocyte-Enhancer-Factor 2) gene (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">West <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Becker and Theissen 2003</xref>). One of the direct consequences of yeast Rlm1 activation through Mpk1 phosphorylation in response to cell wall damage is the transcriptional regulation of several genes related to cell wall metabolism (<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Levin 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Roberts <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although the components of the PkcA-MpkA pathway have been functionally characterized in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Dirr <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Dichtl <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), the participation of the putative downstream <italic>RLM1</italic> ortholog <italic>rlmA</italic> in the CWI pathway has not been elucidated. In addition, several authors have suggested that the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> PkcA-MpkA circuit is not the only one that is responsible for promoting the CWI pathway (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Fujioka <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bruder Nascimento <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of the <italic>A. fumigatus rlmA</italic> gene in the CWI pathway and virulence. We showed that RlmA plays a central role in responses to cell wall stress and positively regulates MpkA phosphorylation. We propose that RlmA is acting downstream of the other components of the canonical <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> CWI pathway, namely PkcA and MpkA, and that this signaling circuit is required for the transcriptional activation of genes that encode cell wall biosynthesis enzymes. The role of <italic>rlmA</italic> as a transcription factor in response to cell wall stress has a dramatic impact on <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> virulence and pathogenicity, given that the &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> strain showed attenuated virulence in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p>The <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> strains used in this study are described in Supplemental Material, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.116.031112/-/DC1/TableS1.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>.

Accordingly, we examined the mRNA levels of <italic>pkcA</italic>, <italic>mpkA</italic>, and the primary genes that encode cell wall biosynthesis enzymes as follows: the catalytic subunit of the &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan synthase (<italic>fksA</italic>); &#x003b1;-1,3-glucan synthases (<italic>agsA-C</italic>); 1,3-&#x003b2;-glucanosyl transferases (<italic>gelA-C</italic> and <italic>gel4</italic>); and the eight <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> chitin synthases (<italic>chsA-G</italic> and <italic>csmB</italic>).</p><p>Overall, in wild-type cells, the response to CR can be divided in three categories: (i) the &#x0201c;responders,&#x0201d; which are genes up-regulated by CR including <italic>rlmA</italic>, <italic>mpkA</italic>, <italic>fksA</italic>, <italic>agsA-B-C</italic>, <italic>gel4</italic>, and <italic>chsA-C-E-F-G</italic>; (ii) the &#x0201c;poor or nonresponder&#x0201d; genes, which show limited or no response to CR including <italic>pkcA</italic>, <italic>gelA-B-C</italic>, and <italic>csmB</italic>; and (iii) the &#x0201c;negative responders,&#x0201d; which are genes down-regulated by CR including <italic>chsB</italic> and <italic>chsD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8, A and B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.116.031112/-/DC1/FigureS7.pdf">Figure S7, A and B</ext-link>).

Cell wall biosynthesis in fungi is controlled by the CWI pathway, which is a signaling transduction cascade that amplifies the upcoming signal and mediates the downstream cell metabolic responses (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Levin 2011</xref>). The CWI pathway is precisely regulated, and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> it starts with the activation of the Pkc1-Mpk1 circuit and culminates with the activation of the Rlm1 transcription factor (<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). This event causes the transcriptional activation of several cell wall biosynthesis genes (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Levin 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, the CWI also relies on the MAPK cascade module of the CWI pathway (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Dirr <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). To understand how <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> connects the upcoming cell wall damage-derived signal to the downstream cell effectors, we identified and characterized the putative <italic>A. fumigatus RLM1</italic> homolog, <italic>rlmA</italic>, and assigned its function in cell signaling and virulence. The <italic>rlmA</italic> deletion mutant exhibits reduced radial growth and delayed hyphal elongation at different temperatures. These phenotypes indicate defects in the CWI pathway in a similar way to those reported for other CWI pathway mutants (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dichtl <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Samantaray <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Indeed, the &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> mutant incorporates phenotypes that are the hallmarks of cell wall perturbation including increased susceptibility to cell wall disturbing agents such as CR, CFW, CAFF echinocandins and nikkomycin Z (an inhibitor of chitin synthase), as previously reported (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Damveld <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Fujioka <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Levin 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Kovacs <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). In addition, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> RlmA was also able to bind to the MADS-Box motif, one of the main hallmarks of the <italic>RLM1</italic> transcription factor (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Damveld <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Levin 2011</xref>), activating luciferase expression. Recently, an independent &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> strain was described and the authors interestingly assigned the role of <italic>rlmA</italic> in the production of (DHN)-melanin by regulating <italic>pksP</italic> (polyketide synthase gene) expression (<xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). In this report, deletion of <italic>rlmA</italic> also resulted in a higher sensitivity to CR compared to the wild-type strain. The &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> mutant also showed impaired resistance to the ER-stressing agents DTT, BFA, and TM. The <italic>A. fumigatus pkcA</italic><sup>G579R</sup> mutant also exhibited altered tolerance to these agents and an unbalanced accumulation of the spliced (induced) <italic>hacA</italic> transcript (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). These data support the idea that the cell wall biogenesis that occurs during cell wall stress is accompanied by the activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Malavazi <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). In considering the range of the cell wall disturbing agents tested here, these results suggest that a lack of <italic>rlmA</italic> leads to alterations in the cell wall structure and/or organization likely interfering with all major polysaccharide moieties that comprise the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> cell wall. Nevertheless, we cannot infer whether the alkali-soluble or alkali-insoluble fractions of the cell wall are quantitatively altered in this mutant at the moment. However, we indirectly analyzed the chitin and &#x003b2;-glucan contents in &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> germlings via CFW and dectin-1 staining. The mutant presented increased detection of &#x003b2;-glucan and chitin in addition to increased protoplast production when the hyphae were subjected to enzymatic digestion. All these phenotypes are accompanied by a thicker cell wall structure inspected by TEM. In fact, sensitivity to cell wall perturbing agents and carbohydrate compositions are barely correlated in some cases. As we previously noted, the differences in sugar compositions between <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and other model fungal organisms or fungal pathogens may account for the differences in the activation of cell wall effectors (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). For instance, the deletion of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> &#x00394;/&#x00394;<italic>RLM1</italic> resulted in a significant increase in the chitin content and a reduction in mannans (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Delgado-Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>A. nidulans</italic> cell wall composition in the &#x00394;<italic>mpkA</italic> mutant was comparable to that of the wild-type, even though the &#x00394;<italic>mpkA</italic> mutant showed poor growth and sensitivity to micafungin (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimi <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). These results further illustrate the point that it is critical to study the function of cell wall-related genes in fungi. The dramatic changes to which the cell is subjected when a given gene is lacking is the result of a concomitant global perturbation in different cell signaling pathways that are reciprocally affected, which accounts for the final phenotype. This idea is supported by several reports indicating that the complete absence of a given carbohydrate moiety still leads to viable cells (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Klimpel and Goldman 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Henry <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dichtl <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Further explanations for this result can be obtained from the genetic analyses of the CWI pathway genes. Strikingly, the phenotypes observed for the &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> and <italic>pkcA</italic><sup>G579R</sup> mutants were milder than the phenotypes of the &#x00394;<italic>mpkA</italic> strain with regards to colony morphology and cell wall stress caused by CR, CFW, or caspofungin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.116.031112/-/DC1/FigureS6.pdf">Figure S6, A&#x02013;E</ext-link>). We propose that <italic>pkcA</italic>, <italic>mpkA</italic>, and <italic>rlmA</italic> are epistatic in the CWI pathway for the recovery of cell wall stress induced by these compounds, and that the CWI pathway in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> resembles that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. However, the MAPK module of the CWI pathway may perform a broader range of multiple roles and interactions inside the cell that result in the severe vegetative growth defects found in these <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> mutants. Some roles of the <italic>mpkA</italic> gene in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> biology, aside from the ones it plays in the CWI pathway, were previously shown and experimentally exploited, which supports our hypothesis. These <italic>mpkA</italic> roles include the production of secondary metabolites and siderophores (<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Jain <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In fact, the cross talk that occurs between the CWI pathway and other signaling cascades has been described as functioning under different stress conditions such as cell wall and osmotic stress in different organisms (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Munro <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs and Mylonakis 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Ouedraogo <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fiedler <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, the coordinated function of the CWI and high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathways was recently demonstrated during adaptation to caspofungin stress (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Altwasser <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). In addition, the contributions of the MAP kinases MpkC and SakA to the CWI pathway were investigated by determining MpkA phosphorylation during CR-induced stress. The results indicated that MpkA phosphorylation was dependent on MpkC and HogA function (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bruder Nascimento <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another explanation for the &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> cell wall-associated phenotypes that were intermediate to those of the &#x00394;<italic>mpkA</italic> strain is that more than one transcription factor is participating in the activation of the cell wall-related genes, an assumption that is supported by the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.116.031112/-/DC1/FigureS7.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>. Accordingly, when the cells are stressed-out through cell wall damage, the canonical CWI pathway is not acting exclusively in the maintenance of the cell wall in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. In fact, this was also reported in <italic>A. niger</italic>, indicating that RlmA is the main transcription factor required for the protection against CFW, but also that it cooperates with MsnA and CrzA to ensure survival of <italic>A. niger</italic> when challenged with caspofungin (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fiedler <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Here, we observed that some genes (<italic>fksA</italic>, <italic>agsA</italic>, <italic>agsC</italic>, <italic>gel4</italic>, <italic>chsA</italic>, <italic>chsC</italic>, <italic>chsE</italic>, <italic>chsF</italic>, and <italic>chsG</italic>) apparently lost their transcriptional activation in both &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>mpkA</italic> mutant backgrounds. On the other hand, MpkA and RlmA are not required for the expression of <italic>gelA</italic> and <italic>gelC</italic>. In addition, <italic>csmB</italic> expression seems to be positively regulated by <italic>rlmA</italic> and negatively regulated by <italic>mpkA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, RlmA could not be the only target of MpkA in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Similar to our results, deletion of the <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Rlm1 displayed modestly impaired growth in the presence of micafungin compared with that of the &#x00394;<italic>slt2</italic>. Additionally, Slt2 may be required for Rlm1 to be fully functional in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Miyazaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p><p>Even though other unidentified transcription factors might participate in the activation of cell effectors to synthesize the cell wall, the connection between the Bck1-Mkk2-MpkA MAP kinase module and the downstream RlmA transcription factor is reflected in the reduced phosphorylation of MpkA in the &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> mutant after CR exposure. Our data suggest that RlmA positively regulates MpkA phosphorylation. We can speculate that, under an <italic>rlmA</italic> loss-of-function, the canonical CWI pathway operates in a defective fashion and other signaling cascades may be activated in a compensatory manner to maintain cell viability. As a consequence, MpkA phosphorylation is kept at low levels under these conditions. In addition, a nonidentified phosphatase may be acting and promoting dephosphorylation of MpkA to control the activity of the CWI pathway in the absence of RlmA.</p><p><italic>A. fumigatus</italic> mutants for genes belonging to the CWI pathway have shown different results when assayed for virulence. For example, mutants that are deficient in the MAPK (MpkA) or in the apical Protein Kinase C (PkcA), are not attenuated in terms of virulence (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Valiante <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rocha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). By contrast, the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> MAPKK <italic>mkk2</italic> is required for full virulence (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Dirr <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) and no information is currently available for the virulence properties of the MAPKKK <italic>bck1</italic>. Our results also indicate that the defective CWI pathway in the &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> mutant is associated with a loss of virulence in the neutropenic murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, a systematic functional profiling of all transcription factors indicated that most of the studied phenotypes for the &#x00394;<italic>RLM1</italic> mutant were comparable to that of the wild-type strain, including cell wall stress parameters and virulence, which were not attenuated in either an insect or a mouse model (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). By contrast, the RLM1 deletion mutant in <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed virulence attenuation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Delgado-Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). The &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> mutant strain was also able to stimulate the BMDM to increase secretion of TNF-&#x003b1;, which is one of the major inflammatory mediators that respond to fungal hyphae. This can be explained by the increased exposure of &#x003b2;-glucan in the &#x00394;<italic>rlmA</italic> mutant, which is a potent stimulator of TNF-&#x003b1; release (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Hohl <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Steele <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The given modifications in the cell wall carbohydrates and proteins observed in the mutant can also contribute to the increased phagocytosis index by the BMDM that was observed here.</p><p>In conclusion, the genetic analysis of a null mutant of <italic>rlmA</italic> in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> strongly suggests that this gene is part of the cell armamentarium that is required to protect the cell wall. In addition, <italic>rlmA</italic> was shown to be involved in the oxidative damage tolerance. The <italic>rlmA</italic> loss-of-function thus directly impacts the virulence of this fungal pathogen. Therefore, an enhanced understanding of the global mechanisms governing the cell wall biogenesis control that emerges from the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> CWI pathway is of paramount importance, and may impact on the establishment of new strategies for drug discovery targeting to other components required for cell wall reinforcement.</p></sec>
