We aimed to estimate years lived in different dependency states at age 65 years in 1991 and 2011, and new projections of future demand for care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this population-based study, we compared two Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I and CFAS II) of older people (aged &#x02265;65 years) who were permanently registered with a general practice in three defined geographical areas (Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham; UK). These studies were done two decades apart (1991 and 2011). General practices provided lists of individuals to be contacted and were asked to exclude those who had died or might die over the next month. Baseline interviews were done in the community and care homes. Participants were stratified by age, and interviews occurred only after written informed consent was obtained. Information collected included basic sociodemographics, cognitive status, urinary incontinence, and self-reported ability to do activities of daily living. CFAS I was assigned as the 1991 cohort and CFAS II as the 2011 cohort, and both studies provided prevalence estimates of dependency in four states: high dependency (24-h care), medium dependency (daily care), low dependency (less than daily), and independent. Years in each dependency state were calculated by Sullivan's method. To project future demands for social care, the proportions in each dependency state (by age group and sex) were applied to the 2014 England population projections.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between 1991 and 2011, there were significant increases in years lived from age 65 years with low dependency (1&#x000b7;7 years [95% CI 1&#x000b7;0&#x02013;2&#x000b7;4] for men and 2&#x000b7;4 years [1&#x000b7;8&#x02013;3&#x000b7;1] for women) and increases with high dependency (0&#x000b7;9 years [0&#x000b7;2&#x02013;1&#x000b7;7] for men and 1&#x000b7;3 years [0&#x000b7;5&#x02013;2&#x000b7;1] for women). The majority of men's extra years of life were spent independent (36&#x000b7;3%) or with low dependency (36&#x000b7;3%) whereas for women the majority were spent with low dependency (58&#x000b7;0%), and only 4&#x000b7;8% were independent. There were substantial reductions in the proportions with medium and high dependency who lived in care homes, although, if these dependency and care home proportions remain constant in the future, further population ageing will require an extra 71&#x02008;215 care home places by 2025.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>On average older men now spend 2&#x000b7;4 years and women 3&#x000b7;0 years with substantial care needs, and most will live in the community.

Current older people spend between 1&#x000b7;7 years and 2&#x000b7;4 years more with low dependency and between 0&#x000b7;9 years and 1&#x000b7;3 years more with high dependency than the generation 20 years ago.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Our research suggests that the current social care crisis is due not only to the increasing numbers of the very old, with their higher morbidity and greater health and social care use, but that current older people are spending more of their remaining life with low and high care needs. Low care needs have implications for family and friends who supply unpaid care because this low dependency is unlikely to meet eligibility criteria for publicly funded care. High care needs have considerable implications for future provision of community services and the state provision of funding for care.</p></boxed-text></p><p>Disability profiles have been used for planning UK health and social care services but have assumed constant disability prevalence over time.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Nevertheless, how disability relates to care needs is not obvious when disability is assessed by the number of activities of daily living requiring help or even when the hierarchical nature of activities<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> defines disability severity.

It uses baseline data from the two Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I and CFAS II) to establish whether dependency prevalence and years spent in different dependency states have changed in the past 20 years, and to model the effect of these findings on future demands for formal social care for older people in England.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Full details of the study design, methods, and response rates have been published,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and are repeated briefly here (a full description of the study design can be found in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). In CFAS I, interviews were done between Aug 23, 1989, and June 13, 1994, in six geographical areas of the UK (Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham, and Oxford); and in CFAS II, they were done between Nov 13, 2008, and Nov 24, 2011, in three (Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham) of the original six geographical areas of the Medical Research Council's CFAS but with the same study design and methods. Interviews occurred only after written informed consent was obtained. Ethics approval for CFAS I and CFAS II were obtained through the multicentre ethics committee and from relevant local research ethics committees.</p><p>Participants from CFAS I were assigned as the 1991 cohort, and those from CFAS II were assigned as the 2011 cohort. The target population for each cohort was people aged 65 years or older who were permanently registered with a participating general practice in the areas (including those in institutional care), each area providing 2500 individuals aged 65 years and older with stratification by age group (65&#x02013;74 years <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;75 years; 1250 per stratum per area). General practices provided lists of individuals to be contacted and were asked to exclude those who had died or might die over the next month.

Moreover, fewer older people with substantial care needs (medium or high dependency) now reside in care homes, although if current numbers stay constant, an extra 71&#x02008;215 care home places will be needed by 2025. These findings have considerable implications for older people and their families, with the increasing diversity of family structures, and for countries struggling to fund care for their ageing populations.</p><p>Between 1991 and 2011, we found significant increases in the likelihood of requiring help for three (60%) of the five items defining high dependency, one (50%) of the two items defining medium dependency, and four (80%) of the five items defining low dependency. It is therefore unlikely that our increases in low and high dependency are driven by changes in one or two items. Despite interval need having a strong correlation with frequency of help required,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> the allocation of bathing or washing all over into low dependency rather than medium dependency could be debated. However, analysis of changes in the individual items suggest that moving bathing into moderate dependency would result in even greater increases in low dependency, and little change or a slight decrease in medium dependency. Nevertheless, the levels of dependency reflected in interval need provide a much more transparent indication of intensity of care required than simply summing the number of activities with which an older person requires help.</p><p>Time trends in health expectancies have generally focused on self-rated health and disability, often without any regard to severity of disability,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> although there have been studies at a single timepoint reporting health expectancy based on interval need.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The USA<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and Japan<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> saw increases in years spent with milder disability and stability in years with severe disability over a similar period, in keeping with our earlier findings<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> that used a more restricted set of activity items. In our present study, years with care needs at age 65 years increased by 1&#x000b7;5 years per decade for men and 1&#x000b7;95 years per decade for women, which are substantially more than those in Germany between 2001 and 2009 (approximately 0&#x000b7;28 years per decade for men and 0&#x000b7;47 years per decade for women)<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and in Japan between 2005 and 2009 (0&#x000b7;38 years per decade for men and 0&#x000b7;90 years per decade for women).<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> However, the German and Japanese studies assessed receipt of care from administrative data, which might reflect demand and could miss unmet need.</p><p>If the increase in years with low dependency continues, there will be considerable implications for family and friends who provide the majority of care at this level. Many older people feel the responsibility for care should be with the family rather than with the state, although increasing numbers of divorces, more geographically disparate families, extended working life, and increases in female labour market participation will make such provision more difficult in the future, not only in high-income countries but worldwide.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Moreover, in England, local authorities have tightened their eligibility criteria for publicly funded care and therefore people with low dependency are unlikely to qualify for it; those without close family members to provide unpaid care and sufficient income to purchase care might be left with unmet needs, exacerbating inequalities.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Future longitudinal analysis of CFAS will examine the extent to which the increases in low dependency have widened inequalities as a result of earlier dependency onset in the socially disadvantaged.</p><p>The past two decades have seen reductions in the overall numbers in care homes but higher prevalence of functional and cognitive impairments among residents.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Our findings showed that more years were spent with high dependency, and that older people with substantial dependencies are now more likely to live supported in the community. If dependency prevalence remains constant, we estimate that by 2025 there will be an additional 353&#x02008;000 older people with substantial dependencies; they will have complex care needs that require sustained input from family carers or community health or social care teams to support independent living.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In countries where publicly funded social care is means tested, such as England, older people with substantial savings or incomes will be required to pay for their care privately or rely on intensive unpaid care from their family. This level of intensity of care provision affects negatively on the carer's health, but also, as the carer is often a child, their ability to remain in the workforce.</p><p>So what are the implications for health-care services of the increases in high and low dependency states in older people for the health-care services? The workforce must be competent and adequately skilled to care for an ageing population.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> For care home residents with complex needs, a new specialty&#x02014;a nursing home physician&#x02014;has been developed in the Netherlands;<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> however, high-quality evidence is unavailable to facilitate wider implementation of such new innovative service models. For older people with low dependency living at home, family physicians and their community care teams are the first point of contact for care, and they are increasingly undertaking the majority of chronic illness management.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> In the UK, undergraduate training for doctors is inadequate to meet current and future population needs, and recommendations to extend core training remain as recommendations.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p><p>It is at the point of low dependency, or even earlier when individuals are first encountering activity limitation, when there is the most chance of slowing down decline. Solutions might include building of intrinsic capacity through structured exercise or rehabilitation, or by the provision of appropriate aids and adaptations to compensate for loss of capacity, and delaying the onset of disabling diseases and conditions.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Additional specialist services can therefore be anticipated to support the primary care workforce and provide access to rehabilitation.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Evidence confirms that community-based comprehensive geriatric assessment enables more older people to remain at home for longer than they would without comprehensive geriatric assessment, yet such services are not widely implemented,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and community-based clinicians need tools that are evidence based and practical to help earlier identification of those who would benefit most from such interventions.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p>Because CFAS I and CFAS II are large population-based studies with similar study designs that include individuals who live at home, in sheltered accommodation, and in all residential care settings, our current study provides strong cohort comparisons. However, we noted four limitations. Firstly activities defining dependency were limited to those collected and were mostly assessed through self-report or proxy report, although many were interviewer observed. Secondly, response to interview was higher in CFAS I than in CFAS II, although we used inverse probability weighting to adjust for non-response biases, and levels of dependency have increased. Thirdly, life expectancies were based on the cross-sectional population not actual observed survival data, although these findings will be available in time. Finally, there is little ethnic diversity in CFAS I and CFAS II and therefore our results have limited generalisability to non-white populations.</p><p>A 65-year-old in 2011, compared with their counterpart in 1991, spent on average almost a year longer requiring 24-h care, and a larger proportion received this care at home provided by family and friends and formal home-based services. Early intervention with rehabilitation and provision of appropriate assistive technology when low dependency is first encountered might ensure that fewer remaining years are spent with higher dependency, reducing the burden on family and state funding. Additionally, interval need is more transparent than the usual disability measures, and it fits well within the WHO framework for healthy ageing.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Consensus on the items to form the measure in a global context will be important to provide a policy-relevant outcome for public health interventions and one that can be used by individuals and countries planning future care costs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>De Brauwer</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>D'Hoore</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Swine</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Thys</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Beguin</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Cornette</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Changes in the clinical features of older patients admitted from the emergency department</article-title><source>Arch Gerontol Geriatr</source><volume>59</volume><year>2014</year><fpage>175</fpage><lpage>180</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24726321</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marengoni</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Angleman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Melis</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Aging with multimorbidity: a systematic review of the literature</article-title><source>Ageing Res Rev</source><volume>10</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>430</fpage><lpage>439</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21402176</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>McGue</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeune</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaupel</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Exceptional longevity does not result in excessive levels of disability</article-title><source>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</source><volume>105</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>13274</fpage><lpage>13279</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18711139</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs</collab></person-group><source>World population ageing 2009</source><year>2009</year><publisher-name>United Nations</publisher-name><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WPA2009/WPA2009_WorkingPaper.pdf" id="interrefs10">http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WPA2009/WPA2009_WorkingPaper.pdf</ext-link><comment>(accessed Aug 23, 2015).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Appleby</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jabbal</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><source>Quarterly monitoring report&#x02014;
