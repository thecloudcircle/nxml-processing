Here, we examined whether the perceived position of one arm is affected by proprioceptive signals from the other arm in a one-arm pointing task in which participants specified the perceived position of an unseen reference arm with an indicator paddle. Both arms were hidden from the participant&#x02019;s view throughout the study. In Experiment 1, with both arms placed in front of the body, the participants received 70&#x02013;80 Hz vibration to the elbow flexors of the reference arm (= right arm) to induce the illusion of elbow extension. This extension illusion was compared with that when the left arm elbow flexors were vibrated or not. The degree of the vibration-induced extension illusion of the right arm was reduced in the presence of left arm vibration. In Experiment 2, we found that this kinesthetic interaction between the two arms did not occur when the left arm was vibrated in an abducted position. In Experiment 3, the vibration-induced extension illusion of one arm was fully developed when this arm was placed at an abducted position, indicating that the brain receives increased proprioceptive input from a vibrated arm even if the arm was abducted. Our results suggest that proprioceptive interaction between the two arms occurs in a one-arm pointing task when the two arms are aligned with one another. The position sense of one arm measured using a pointer appears to include the influences of incoming information from the other arm when both arms were placed in front of the body and parallel to one another.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All law data files are available from the Dryad Digital Repository using the following url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.8sc5p">http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.8sc5p</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All law data files are available from the Dryad Digital Repository using the following url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.8sc5p">http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.8sc5p</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The awareness of the positions of the body&#x02019;s limbs occurs not only through vision but also through proprioception [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There is some evidence that proprioceptive signals coming from both arms are used to determine the perceived position and movement of one arm [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The perceived position of one arm may represent a difference signal calculated using the input coming from both arms [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We have shown that when both arms are vertically aligned and then one arm is moved into an extension, the perception of a slower vibration-induced illusion occurs in the other arm [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because elbow extension increases the spindle signal in its own elbow flexors, the difference in spindle discharge rate between the two arms is reduced. What is perceived during the extension illusion of one arm is based, at least in part, on a difference signal derived from the inputs of both arms [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The sense of limb position can be measured in the arms using a two-arm matching task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Typically, an experimenter places the participant&#x02019;s unseen reference arm at a particular elbow angle, and the participant is asked to match the angle by placement of the other arm [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Combined with the two-arm matching task, externally applied muscle vibration of the reference arm has been used in studies investigating the role of muscle spindle activity in proprioceptive sensation [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. An important characteristic of muscle vibration is its ability to selectively excite the primary endings of muscle spindles [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and cause vibration illusion [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To give an example of vibration illusion, muscle vibration of elbow flexors produces an illusion of changed position in the direction of elbow extension [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, we have shown that vibration illusion of the reference arm was reduced by muscle vibration of the other arm in a two-arm matching task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This observation highlights the importance of the difference signal in the position sense between the two arms in a two-arm matching task.</p><p>The limb position sense can also be measured using a one-arm pointing task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the one-arm pointing task, participants indicate the position of the unseen reference arm with a pointer, not with the other arm. The pointer is a part of a mechanical device, not a body part. Thus, an important difference between the matching and pointing tasks is that an afferent signal from the pointer is unavailable in the one-arm pointing task to specify the position of the reference arm. Alternatively, it has been speculated that in pointing tasks reference is made to a central map of the body, the postural schema, to locate the position of the reference arm [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Stored body representations have been shown by various means [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, Longo and Haggard [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] provided evidence in support of a stored model of the body&#x02019;s metric properties. Their subjects used a long metal baton with their right hands to point to the position of 10 landmarks on their unseen left hands. The subjects successfully drew a central body representation of their hands, which included distortions in size and shape of the hand. The postural schema is referred to as a perceptual representation of the posture of the body, but this pre-existing representation in the brain is plastic and continuously updated by proprioceptive afferent information [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>We previously raised the possibility that what appears to be a one-arm proprioceptive test (i.e., the pointing task) may in fact include some input from the other arm [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; however, verification of this hypothesis awaited further investigation. We also speculated that the interaction in the position sense between the two arms, reported in a two-arm matching task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], occurs only when the two arms are aligned to act as a single instrument [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Here, we examined whether the perceived position of one arm is affected by proprioceptive signals from the other arm in a one-arm pointing task. First of all, we examined whether proprioceptive illusions elicited by the vibration of elbow flexors in the reference arm were altered by increases in the muscle spindle signals in the other arm in a one-arm pointing task (Experiment 1). If we determined that proprioceptive interaction between the two arms occurred in the one-arm pointing task, we then planned to test whether the interaction occurred irrespective of arm position (Experiment 2). Thus, we could determine whether the position sense of the reference arm was affected by proprioceptive signals coming from the other arm placed at an irrelevant position. In Experiment 3, we planned to extend the findings of Experiment 2 by examining whether the vibration-induced extension illusion of the reference arm occurred to the same extent regardless of the position of this arm. The overall aim of the work was to examine whether the perceived position of the reference arm is affected by proprioceptive signals from the other arm in a one-arm pointing task. We found that proprioceptive interaction between the two arms occurred in this task when the two arms were aligned with one another.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 15 male students participated in this study, which consisted of Experiments 1, 2, and 3, with 10 volunteers participating in each experiment.

The device consisted of two paddles, one on the right and one on the left side. The participant&#x02019;s right forearm was strapped to the right paddle and placed at an angle of 30&#x000b0; from the horizontal, with a support block under the paddle. The left forearm was placed on another support block, also inclined at 30&#x000b0;. The left paddle (indicator paddle) was used as an indicator that measured the perceived position of the reference arm. The reference arm was the right arm in Experiments 1 and 2 and the left arm in Experiment 3. The paddle hinge was arranged to coincide with the elbow joints. There was one partition between the right arm and the indicator paddle and another between the indicator paddle and the left arm, arranged to block the participants&#x02019; views of their own right and left arms, but allowing them to see the indicator paddle. In Experiments 2 and 3, the left arm was placed in front of the body and parallel to the right arm, or it was rotated externally (abducted position) (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, right panel).

In Experiments 2 and 3, the left arm was placed in front of the body or at an abducted position. Each vibrator was placed on the distal tendon of the biceps of each arm. The left paddle (indicator paddle) was used as an indicator that measured the perceived vertical angle of the unseen reference forearm to the horizontal surface.

The actual angle of the reference forearm was always 30&#x000b0; from the horizontal (dashed line). The perceived angle of the reference forearm was measured twice in each trial: the first and the second pointing tasks (filled triangles). The differences between the angles obtained in the first pointing task (dotted line) and the second pointing task were calculated for each of the four conditions (angle difference; &#x00394;angle). When the indicator paddle was placed in a more extended position in the second pointing task than in the first pointing task, &#x00394;angle was expressed as a negative value.

A rotary encoder (E6H-CWZ6C, OMRON, Kyoto, Japan) was fixed to the side of the paddle. The encoder provided a pulse output every 0.1&#x000b0; above the horizontal (0&#x000b0;). The number of pulses was counted by a pulse meter (K3HB-C, OMRON) that sent a linear output signal to a recording device (Power Lab, 4/20, ADInstruments, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). All data were recorded using LabChart software (ADInstruments) with a computer.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Vibrators</title><p>Two custom-made vibrators were used in this study. Each vibrator comprised a motor-driven eccentric disk that was enclosed in a plastic box measuring 50 mm &#x000d7; 60 mm &#x000d7; 88 mm. The vibration amplitude was approximately 1 mm and the frequency could be adjusted between 70 and 80 Hz, close to the optimum for engaging responses from muscle spindles [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Each vibrator was placed on the distal tendon of the biceps of each arm using elastic straps (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Muscle conditioning before matching</title><p>Muscle conditioning was conduced before each pointing task.

To do this, the elbow flexors of both arms, which were aligned with one another in front of the body, were first contracted at the vertical angle of 30&#x000b0; because muscle shortening or lengthening after contraction changes the muscle spindle activity, leading to position sense illusions as a result of muscle thixotropy [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For this conditioning, the participant was asked to flex each arm with a contraction of perceived 30&#x02013;50% of maximum for 3 s while the experimenter held the participant&#x02019;s wrists; the participant was then asked to relax. Experiments were started within 30 s after conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>The aim of this experiment was to examine whether muscle vibration of one arm affected the position sense of the other arm in the vertical plane using a one-arm pointing task (<italic>n</italic> = 10) (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The right arm was used as the reference arm. Thus, we examined whether the presence and absence of left arm vibration changed the extension illusion in the right arm. Both arms were placed in front of the body and parallel to one another throughout Experiment 1.</p><p>Participants had their eyes open and were able to see the indicator paddle, but they could see neither their right nor left arms because their own arms were hidden from view by the partitions (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). A schema for Experiment 1 is shown in <xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>. Both arms were continuously maintained at an angle 30&#x000b0; from the horizontal (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). After participants completed conditioning both arms, vibration of elbow flexors in both arms commenced (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). After a 30-s vibration period, participants were asked to specify the angle of the right arm using the indicator paddle while vibration of the elbow flexors in both arms continued. An experimenter placed the indicator paddle at 60&#x000b0; and then began moving the paddle toward the horizontal plane. The experimenter changed the speed of the movement or the angle of the paddle if requested by the participant. When the participants declared that the angle of the indicator paddle matched that of the right arm, the angle of the indicator paddle was measured. This was referred to as the first pointing task.</p><p>Thirty seconds after completion of the first pointing task, the second pointing task was conducted under each of four testing conditions, with and without vibration of the elbow flexors of the right and left arms (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The indicator paddle was maintained at the angle determined by the participant in the first pointing task until the start of the second pointing task. When vibration was continued in both arms after the completion of the first pointing task, this condition was referred to as R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>/R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>. The R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub> before the slash denotes vibrating the right and left arms during the first pointing task, and the R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub> after the slash indicates vibrating the right and left arms for the second pointing task. For the R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>/R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>off</sub> condition, the vibrator of the left arm was turned off after completion of the first pointing task, but the vibrator of the right arm remained on until completion of the second pointing task. For the R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>/R<sub>off</sub>L<sub>on</sub> condition, the vibrator of the right arm was turned off after completion of the first pointing task. For the R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>/R<sub>off</sub>L<sub>off</sub> condition, both vibrators were tuned off after completion of the first pointing task. The different conditions were presented in random order, and each condition was repeated three times for a total of 12 trials with each participant.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>This experiment tested the hypothesis that muscle vibration of the other arm alters the vibration-induced illusion of elbow extension in the reference arm when both arms are aligned in front of the body, but not when the other arm is in an abducted position (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, right panel).

During the first pointing task in Experiment 3, an experimenter moved the indicator paddle from 60&#x000b0; toward the horizontal plane until the participant declared a match between the angles of the indicator paddle and the left arm. After completion of the first pointing task, the vibration of the left arm began. The right arm was not vibrated throughout this experiment. The experimenter set the indicator paddle at the angle specified by the participant during the first pointing task. After a 30-s vibration period, participants were asked to match the angle of the indicator paddle with that of the left arm. When the participants declared that the angle of the indicator paddle matched the perceived position of the left arm, the angle was measured (second pointing task). The vibration continued until the completion of the second pointing task. The two positions of the left arm (frontal or abducted position) were used in random order, and each position was repeated three times for a total of six trials in each participant.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The differences were calculated between the angles obtained in the first and second pointing tasks in each experiment (angle difference, &#x00394;angle) (<xref rid="pone.0137031.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, bottom panel), and the mean for the three repetitions in a single participant was used as the value representing that participant.

Although this task had been thought to be a one-arm proprioceptive test [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], our results indicated that there was proprioceptive input from both arms. In Experiment 1, proprioceptive illusions elicited by the vibration of the elbow flexors in one arm were reduced by increases in the muscle spindle signals from the other arm in this one-arm pointing task. In Experiment 2, this interaction occurred when the other arm was vibrated at a position aligned with the reference arm, but it did not occur when the other arm was vibrated at an abducted position. In Experiment 3, the extent of the proprioceptive illusion elicited by vibration in one arm was similar whether the arm was placed at an abducted position or in front of the body. This result suggested that the brain received increased proprioceptive input from a vibrated arm even when the arm was placed at an abducted position. In Experiment 2, the brain presumably received increased proprioceptive input from the abducted arm when it was vibrated. However, a comparison mechanism for the proprioceptive signals from two arms, which remains controversial [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], would not come into play here, likely because the brain considered the positions of the arms irrelevant.</p><p>We recently reported on a new aspect of the comparison mechanism for proprioceptive signals from two arms in an arm matching task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and this aspect is consistent with the results of the present Experiment 1 using an arm pointing task. We reported that elbow flexor vibration of the reference arm could not fully elicit the proprioceptive illusions of elbow extension in an arm matching task if elbow flexors of the other arm were simultaneously vibrated [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This implies a degree of interaction for the incoming proprioceptive information from the two arms in the one-arm matching task. If an interaction in spindle signals between the two arms does not occur, the degree of the extension illusion elicited by elbow flexor vibration of the reference arm would be the same in the presence and absence of elbow flexor vibration of the other arm. Our explanation for the reduced proprioceptive illusion in an arm matching task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is that elbow flexor vibration of the other arm reduces the relative increase in muscle spindle activity in the reference arm in response to reference arm vibration. Presumably, spindle signals from both arms are integrated in the brain, and a difference signal is produced by neuronal computation to determine the perceptual representation of the reference arm&#x02019;s position. Once the brain determines this new perceptual position, which includes the interaction between the signals from both arms, the other arm, used as an indicator, must move toward that position. Thus, the other arm does not appear to move toward a position that is deduced using signals derived only from the reference arm.</p><p>For the pointing task, information from the tested arm must be compared with a stored model of the metric properties for the limb [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is different for the matching and pointing tasks. Proske and Gandevia [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] stated in their review paper that &#x0201c;while proprioceptors provide information about position and movement of the limb, they are unable to signal the length of limb segments and therefore the absolute location of the limb in space.&#x0201d; Presumably, arm matching is performed on the basis of the spindle signals from the two arms and the interaction between them [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For a two-arm matching task, one arm acts as a reference point, and knowing the absolute location of the two arms in space is not required for this task. However, if the position of one arm alters the position sense of the other arm in a matching task, similarly to the pointing task, the absolute location of the two arms may also be involved in the matching task. By contrast, in an arm pointing task, participants must specify the absolute location of the unseen arm in space, and an indicator proprioceptive signal is no longer available. Thus, locating body parts in space requires a combination of afferent information and stored representations of the body [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the present study, our participants may also have accessed such a central map to describe the angle of their unseen arms with the indicator paddle. Inui et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that a central map of the hand is updated with time by changes in peripheral afferent input for an experimental phantom hand. Based on the results of our Experiment 1, it is conceivable that a central map of one arm changes in response to proprioceptive signals from the other arm. Presumably, the reference arm vibration distorts a central map of the reference arm, and the distorted map is further updated by vibration of the other arm. As a result, in the present study, the vibration-induced extension illusion of the reference arm was altered by vibration of the other arm in the arm-pointing task.</p><p>When the arms were aligned with one another in front of the body in our Experiment 1, the proprioceptive illusions elicited by vibrating the elbow flexors in one arm were altered by increases in the muscle spindle signals from the other arm. However, in Experiment 2, such an interaction in the position sense did not occur when the other arm was vibrated at an abducted position. By contrast, in Experiment 3, the vibration-induced extension illusion of one arm was maintained even when the arm was placed at an abducted position. Presumably, the brain was able to sense the incoming positional information from the abducted arm. In the arm-pointing task, the brain appears to ignore the incoming information from the other arm when it is abducted, while primarily referring to a central body map to determine the position of the reference arm. We previously speculated that the behavioral importance of the body&#x02019;s position matching mechanism, based on the proprioceptive signals coming from the two arms, resides in the need for accurate alignment of the two arms to act as a single instrument [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our present results support the implication that this mechanism comes into play when the brain judges that the positions of the arms are relevant.</p><p>The duration of vibration exceeded 30 s. Vibration lasting for more than 30 s may confound the interpretation of our results. Our previous study showed that 10-s vibration of the biceps had little post-effect on the forearm position sense in a two-arm matching task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, 30-s vibration induces long lasting alteration of proprioceptive perception [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In particular, Experiment 1 seems to be involved with the post-effect of vibration given before and during the first pointing task. Under R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>/R<sub>off</sub>L<sub>off</sub> conditions, the mean value of the indicator paddle angle for the first pointing task was 17.1&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 1.2&#x000b0;. This value meant that vibration illusions occurred in the right arm because pointing angles ranged between approximately 30 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;when neither arm was vibrated in Experiments 2 and 3. Then, the mean value of the &#x00394;angle under R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>/R<sub>off</sub>L<sub>off</sub> conditions was 2.0&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 0.8&#x000b0;. This indicates that the participants still felt their right arm placed at an extended position at the time of the second pointing task, suggesting that effects of vibrating before the first pointing task lasted. Because the mean value of the &#x00394;angle was 3.6&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 1.2&#x000b0; under R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>/R<sub>off</sub>L<sub>on</sub> conditions, left arm vibration after the first pointing task (/R<sub>off</sub>L<sub>on</sub>) may have counterbalanced the post-effect of vibrating before the first pointing task (R<sub>on</sub>L<sub>on</sub>). Therefore, pointing errors measured in the second pointing task do not involve only the effects of vibration being given at the exact moment; the errors likely included the post-effects. Furthermore, the more than 30-s vibration may have caused &#x0201c;proprioceptive drift&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There are time-dependent changes in the perceived position of the reference arm in an arm matching task [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], leading to the possibility that such a proprioceptive drift is included in our results.</p><p>We have to acknowledge several limitations of the present study. We did not determine how close the arms had to be before the interaction was perceived. Specifying boundary conditions when the interaction converts to a positive result will be the subject of our next investigation. Tsay et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] proposed that such a neural mechanism concerned with comparing signals from the two arms functions within a short range, with vertical angle limits of 10&#x000b0; in an arm matching task. Thus, it is conceivable that the interaction between the two arms found in the present study also occurs for limited arm positions.</p><p>We measured the vertical angle of the participants&#x02019; forearm but did not measure the angle between participants&#x02019; arm and forearm. The latter angle may be more adapted to quantify the illusory elbow extension than vertical angles. The same vertical angles between the horizontal line and participants&#x02019; forearms could induce different elbow extensions depending on the position of the participants&#x02019; arm and their bodies. Furthermore, illusion induction can vary depending on the contraction or lengthening of the muscle [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We could also have added conditioning of elbow extensors. In the present study, elbow flexors were conditioned to place their muscle spindle responsiveness in a defined thixotropic state [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, Proske and his colleagues have shown recently that in a two-arm matching task the brain is concerned with the signal difference from the antagonist pair of each arm [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137031.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, spindle signals from unconditioned elbow extensors may have affected the perception of the elbow angle, even in the pointing task.</p><p>We used the same indicator starting position and movement direction for every trial. Visual feedback of the indicator paddle may have something to do with our results [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We cannot exclude this possibility for biases.</p><p>The proprioceptive interaction between the two arms occurred in a one-arm pointing task when the two arms were aligned with one another. When position sense is measured using the one-arm pointing task within a range where the two arms are aligned out of sight, the brain uses proprioceptive information from the two arms and refers to a central body map in determining the position of the unseen reference arm. Arm pointing tasks have been regarded as single limb tasks [<xref rid="pone.0137031.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but measuring position sense in one arm with a pointer includes influences of incoming information from the other arm when both arms are placed in front of the body and parallel to one another.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0137031.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
