In this study, a yeast assay was used to isolate and characterize two genes, <italic>MTP8.1</italic> and <italic>MTP8.2</italic>, which encode membrane-bound proteins belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family in the cereal species barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>). Transient expression in onion epidermal cells showed that MTP8.1 and MTP8.2 proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) are localized to Golgi. When heterologously expressed in yeast, MTP8.1 and MTP8.2 were found to be Mn transporters catalysing Mn efflux in a similar manner as the Golgi localized endogenous yeast protein Pmr1p. The level of <italic>MTP8.1</italic> transcripts in barley roots increased with external Mn supply ranging from deficiency to toxicity, while <italic>MTP8.2</italic> transcripts decreased under the same conditions, indicating non-overlapping functions for the two genes. In barley leaves, the expression of both <italic>MTP8</italic> genes declined in response to toxic Mn additions to the roots suggesting a role in ensuring proper delivery of Mn to Golgi. Based on the above we suggest that barley MTP8 proteins are involved in Mn loading to the Golgi apparatus and play a role in Mn homeostasis by delivering Mn to Mn-dependent enzymes and/or by facilitating Mn efflux via secretory vesicles. This study highlights the importance of MTP transporters in Mn homeostasis and is the first report of Golgi localized Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport proteins in a monocot plant species.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported financially by grants from The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (contract 274-06-0325) and the Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education (Research Council grant DSF-10-093498-NUTRIEFFICIENT).

Despite the many important physiological functions of manganese (Mn) in the plant cell, the amount required for optimal growth is relatively low. However, the Mn<sup>2+</sup> uptake capacity greatly exceeds this requirement <xref rid="pone.0113759-Pedas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113759-Rengel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and consequently an effective efflux system must exist to ensure homeostasis of Mn in plant tissue. The Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration in soil solution increases with decreasing soil pH and redox potential <xref rid="pone.0113759-Marschner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Mn toxicity is therefore a widespread phenomenon in acidic and waterlogged soils, constituting approximately 30% of the Earth's surface <xref rid="pone.0113759-Uexkll1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>As an essential micronutrient, Mn has many functions in plant metabolism. In the cytosol, Mn activates the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) of the shikimic pathway, leading to biosynthesis of various key metabolites <italic>e.g.</italic> the cell wall component lignin <xref rid="pone.0113759-Burnell1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In peroxisomes and mitochondria, Mn acts as an inorganic cofactor of Mn superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), a protein responsible for scavenging of reactive oxygen species <xref rid="pone.0113759-Bowler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113759-Alscher1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Also, a number of glycosyl transferases localized in Golgi has been shown to have Mn-dependent activity. Some of these enzymes, such as arabinan arabinosyltransferase, xyloglucan glycosyltransferase, UDP-xylose glucuronyltransferase and arabinoxylan arabinosyltransferase, catalyse synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides <xref rid="pone.0113759-White1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0113759-Porchia1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Finally, Mn is also an unspecific activator of a number of different enzymes such as decarboxylases and dehydrogenases in the tricaboxylic acid cycle <xref rid="pone.0113759-Marschner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, the most prominent role of Mn is its involvement in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII). PSII is responsible for the photolytic dissociation of water, which releases molecular oxygen and protons while initiating the photosynthetic electron flow <xref rid="pone.0113759-Ono1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Due to its wide variety of essential functional properties, Mn deficiency leads to multiple visual symptoms in plants. Among these are interveinal chlorosis, necrotic spots, lower root biomass and slack leaves due to a reduction in the content of fructans and structural carbohydrates, resulting in an overall reduction in the yield potential of Mn-deficient plants <xref rid="pone.0113759-Hebbern1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0113759-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Cellular Mn homeostasis in plants is regulated by processes involved in uptake, translocation, cellular sequestration and storage of Mn <xref rid="pone.0113759-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113759-Pittman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Symplastic Mn transport is facilitated by several transport proteins. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the major player in Mn<sup>2+</sup> uptake during conditions of Mn limitation appears to be the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein NRAMP1, which is a high-affinity Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporter located in the root plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0113759-Cailliatte1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The <italic>nramp1</italic> mutant has both reduced biomass production and a threefold reduction in Mn shoot concentrations when compared to wild type plants. As a result, the <italic>nramp1</italic> mutant is sensitive towards Mn deficiency <xref rid="pone.0113759-Cailliatte1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Also, the plasma membrane localized multi-specific ion transporter IRT1 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been shown to transport Mn<sup>2+</sup> into the cell <xref rid="pone.0113759-Vert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113759-Korshunova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, although the primary role of AtIRT1 is related to Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> uptake, especially during Fe deficiency.</p><p>In the tonoplast, AtCAX2 belonging to the cation exchanger (CAX) family has the ability to transport Mn<sup>2+</sup> into the vacuole. Expression studies in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) and yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) have indicated a role for AtCAX2 in Mn<sup>2+</sup> removal from the cytosol during excess Mn<sup>2+</sup> conditions <xref rid="pone.0113759-Hirschi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0113759-Pittman2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In seeds, the vacuolar iron transporter VIT1 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is involved in storage of Mn and Fe, thus ensuring the availability of micronutrients during early growth of seedlings <xref rid="pone.0113759-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The third known vacuolar Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporter, ShMTP1, has been identified in the Mn-tolerant tropical legume <italic>Stylosanthes hamata</italic> and is a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) transporter family. Heterologous expression of ShMTP8 in yeast or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> results in increased Mn tolerance and higher cellular contents of Mn <xref rid="pone.0113759-Delhaize1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> (ShMTP1 has been renamed to ShMTP8 following the nomenclature for Mn-MTP proteins; <xref rid="pone.0113759-Montanini1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>). Recently, the MTP8 homolog from rice has been isolated in a yeast Mn tolerance screen. OsMTP8 was found to be localized to the vacuole and it is suggested that OsMTP8 is important for Mn detoxification by sequestering Mn in the vacuole of rice plants <xref rid="pone.0113759-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Remobilization of vacuolar Mn in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is mediated by NRAMP3 and NRAMP4. In mesophyll cells, these proteins are likely to be involved in transport of Mn<sup>2+</sup> from the vacuole to chloroplast, thus ensuring optimal OEC activity in PSII. However, neither NRAMP3 nor NRAMP4 seems to be involved in supplying vacuolar stored Mn<sup>2+</sup> to the mitochondrial Mn superoxide dismutase <xref rid="pone.0113759-Lanquar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113759-Lanquar2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Transport of intracellular Mn<sup>2+</sup> can also be mediated by P-type ATPases belonging to the subfamily P<sub>2A</sub>. The endoplasmic reticulum-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 1 (ECA1), from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transports Mn into ER <xref rid="pone.0113759-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The ECA1 homolog AtECA3 has been localized to Golgi and the growth of <italic>eca3</italic> mutants was severely hampered under low Mn conditions indicating a crucial role under Mn limiting conditions <xref rid="pone.0113759-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, an additional study has shown that AtECA3-GFP is associated with prevacuolar compartments and AtECA3 seems to be involved in detoxification of excess Mn<sup>2+</sup> since <italic>eca3</italic> mutants were sensitive to 50 &#x000b5;M Mn<sup>2+</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0113759-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Two additional genes, ECA2 and ECA4, are identified in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome <xref rid="pone.0113759-Axelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, but are still not characterized. MTP11 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was localized to the Golgi apparatus by Peiter et al <xref rid="pone.0113759-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and they suggested that AtMTP11 is involved in Mn tolerance by loading Mn into secretory vesicles that allows Mn removal from the cell via exocytosis. A contrasting study localized AtMTP11 to the prevacuolar compartment indicating compartmentalization as the tolerance mechanism <xref rid="pone.0113759-Delhaize2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These findings indicate that AtMTP11 could be dynamically localized depending on the actual Mn status and cellular conditions of the plant tissue. Taken together, the studies conducted on Mn homeostasis show that Mn homeostasis is regulated by a highly dynamic series of transporters depending on the Mn status of the plant.</p><p>The majority of studies concerning Mn transport proteins have so far been obtained from dicotyledonous plants and solid experimental evidence regarding transport proteins controlling Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport in monocotyledonous plants are lacking. In addition to OsMTP8, four plasma membrane localized transporters from monocot plant species have been identified. First, the IRT1 homologue from barley is a multi-substrate protein, which in addition to Mn also has the ability to transport Fe, Zn and Cd. Transcription of <italic>IRT1</italic> is induced by Fe and Mn deficiency, where both deficiencies independently lead to an increased Mn uptake capacity of the root <xref rid="pone.0113759-Pedas2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The second Mn transport protein from monocots is the yellow stripe-like protein 2 (YSL2) from rice. OsYSL2 mediates <italic>in vitro</italic> transport of both Mn(II)- and Fe(III)-nicotianamine. <italic>OsYLS2</italic> expression is particularly pronounced in companion cells in roots, phloem cells of the vascular bundles in leaves and in developing seeds <xref rid="pone.0113759-Koike1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Based on the physiological performance of different rice lines with varying expression levels of <italic>OsYSL2</italic>, the encoded transporter has been suggested to operate in Fe and Mn translocation, especially to shoots and the endosperm of developing grains <xref rid="pone.0113759-Ishimaru1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The YSL2 homologue OsYSL6 is involved in Mn translocation between the apoplast and symplast in leaves, a process which could affect the plants tolerance towards Mn toxicity <xref rid="pone.0113759-Sasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Finally, in rice OsNRAMP3 is shown to regulate Mn shoot distribution depending on environmental conditions <xref rid="pone.0113759-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113759-Yamaji1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The OsNRAMP3 protein is constitutively expressed except during Mn excess conditions, where it is internalized in vesicles and rapidly degraded. The vascular-bundle specific localization in nodes ensures that Mn follows the transpiration stream to the youngest leaves during low and moderate Mn conditions, whereas during Mn excess Mn is translocated to old leaves and thereby preventing Mn toxicity in the young shoot tissue.</p><p>In the present study we have used yeast as a tool to identify and characterize two novel barley genes, <italic>MTP8.1</italic> and <italic>MTP8.2</italic>, encoding Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport proteins. Root transcripts of <italic>MTP8.1</italic> and <italic>MTP8.2</italic> show contrasting responses towards external concentrations of Mn, suggesting that the two proteins are transcriptionally regulated depending on the Mn nutritional status of the plant. Both MTP8.1 and MTP8.2 proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were localized to Golgi. This is the first report of Golgi localized Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport proteins that are involved in intracellular Mn homeostasis of a monocot plant species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Functional complementation in yeast</title><p>Wild type (WT) yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) strain (BY4741) and 7 deletion mutants in the same genetic background were used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113759-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Analysis of the Mn accumulation in <italic>pmr1&#x00394;</italic> yeast cells expressing barley MTP8 proteins showed that these proteins are involved in Mn efflux, as <italic>MTP8 pmr1&#x00394;</italic> cells had a 20% reduction in their Mn contents when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113759-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). This reduction is relatively small compared to the 25 fold reduction in Mn content caused by the presence of Pmr1p in wild type yeast compared to <italic>pmr1&#x00394;</italic> mutant. However, the Mn cellular homeostasis in yeast is tightly controlled <xref rid="pone.0113759-Reddi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In this heterologous expression system it is therefore unlikely that a plant Mn transport protein would be able to interact with the endogenous homeostatic partners in the same manner as the native Mn transporter. Nevertheless, expression of the MTP8 proteins enabled the yeast mutant to maintain optimal growth even at 5 mM Mn in the growth medium. The elemental profile of yeast cells grown at these two non-toxic Mn concentrations, with a minimum regulation of endogenous Mn homeostasis, strongly suggests that the tolerance mechanism is Mn efflux. The reduction in Mn content may be due to the MTP8 proteins being localized in the plasma membrane and/or Golgi apparatus. Previously, the Zn transporter TgMTP1 has been suggested to have a role in Zn tolerance due to its localization to the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0113759-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Furthermore, the Mn specific AtMTP11 protein has been suggested to have a role in Mn efflux due to its localization in the Golgi apparatus, where it delivers Mn into secretory vesicles directed to exocytosis <xref rid="pone.0113759-Peiter1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The cellular localization of the MTP8 proteins <italic>in planta</italic> were clarified using transiently expressed GFP fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells. Transient expression of both MTP8-GFP fusion proteins in onion cells resulted in MTP8-GFP proteins co-localizing with the Golgi marker GONST1, thus supporting localization in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113759-g003">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>). This suggests a physiological role for MTP8 proteins <italic>in planta</italic>, where they may load Mn into Golgi in order to either provide Mn for Mn dependent enzymes within the Golgi or to efflux Mn via exocytosis of secretory vesicles. This is in contrast to the rice MTP8 homolog shown to be localized in the vacuole with a suggested role in Mn detoxification based on vacuolar Mn sequestration <xref rid="pone.0113759-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>To determine if MTP8 proteins have a role in Mn toxicity tolerance in barley, similar to the heterologous yeast system, expression analysis by RT-qPCR was performed. The gene expression data showed that plants exposed to excessive Mn supply resulted in down-regulation of both <italic>MTP8</italic> transcripts in leaf tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113759-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), as well as <italic>MTP8.2</italic> transcripts in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113759-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This indicates that the primary physiological roles of MTP8 proteins are not directly related to detoxification of excess Mn <italic>in planta</italic>. Instead they may be involved in the delivery of Mn to metabolic processes of the Golgi.</p><p>In contrast, the expression pattern of <italic>MTP8.1</italic> in roots was positively correlated with the Mn concentration outside the root. Therefore, MTP8.1 may serve dual roles <italic>in planta</italic> both balancing excess Mn in roots and maintaining Mn homeostasis in Golgi in leaves. The <italic>MTP8.1</italic> isoform was highly represented among the yeast clones complementing the <italic>pmr1</italic> yeast strain in the original screen of the barley cDNA library, probably due to the generally higher transcript levels of MTP8.1 when compared to MTP8.2 in control plants (data not shown).</p><p>Hemicelluloses and pectins are synthesized in Golgi and require several different types of transport proteins to deliver sugars, acetyl-CoA, co-factors and ions to the working glycosyltransferases in the Golgi lumen <xref rid="pone.0113759-Reyes1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Some glycosyltransferases require Mn for their activity <xref rid="pone.0113759-White1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0113759-Porchia1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and due to their position in the Golgi lumen they are dependent on Mn-transporters placed in the Golgi membrane to facilitate metal delivery. The importance of the Golgi Mn pool may be directly visualized during Mn deficiency in plants, where slack leaves are a prominent and well described symptom. This is likely to be a result of Mn-deficiency induced defects in the delivery of intact cell wall components to growing cells.</p><p>Recent studies in mammalian cells indicate that the maintenance of Mn homeostasis is more complex than simply a matter of compartmentalization of Mn. A human Mn sensing glycoprotein (GPP130) has been found to induce vesicle trafficking from Golgi to multivesicular vesicles in response to elevated Golgi Mn concentrations as a way to regulate Mn extrusion from cells <xref rid="pone.0113759-Mukhopadhyay1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113759-Mukhopadhyay2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.
