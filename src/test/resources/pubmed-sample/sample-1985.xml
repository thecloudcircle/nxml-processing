Although computerized questionnaires and surveys are used with increasing frequency in clinical practice, few studies have examined question completion time (QCT), the time required to complete each question. Here, we analyzed QCTs in 172 control subjects and 31 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who completed two computerized questionnaires, the 17-question Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) and the 25-question Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). In control subjects, robust correlations were found between self-paced QCTs on the PCL and CFQ (<italic>r</italic> = 0.82). QCTs on individual questions correlated strongly with the number of words in the question, indicating the critical role of reading speed. QCTs increased significantly with age, and were reduced in females and in subjects with increased education and computer experience. QCT <italic>z</italic>-scores, corrected for age, education, computer use, and sex, correlated more strongly with each other than with the results of other cognitive tests. Patients with a history of severe TBI showed significantly delayed QCTs, but QCTs fell within the normal range in patients with a history of mild TBI. When questionnaires are used to gather relevant patient information, simultaneous QCT measures provide reliable and clinically sensitive measures of processing speed and executive function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>gender</kwd><kwd>reaction time</kwd><kwd>executive function</kwd><kwd>head injury</kwd><kwd>reading</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6993"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Questionnaire completion engages a set of complex cognitive processes. Prior to question delivery, and between consecutive questions, subjects must maintain overall task engagement and alertness (Stuss, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) while simultaneously focusing attention and avoiding distractions (Commodari and Guarnera, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Subjects must read and analyze each question, placing demands on long-term and working memory (Christopher et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Subjects must then evaluate the responses, select the most appropriate option, and respond accordingly. All of these processes depend on executive functions and show age-related declines (Brand and Markowitsch, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Not surprisingly, the overall completion time for questionnaires increases with age (Malhotra, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) in a manner that parallels the age-related slowing seen on neuropsychological tests of executive function and processing speed (Salthouse, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Woods et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). Here, we examine the use of individual question completion times (QCTs) as a measure of cognitive function.</p><p>Questionnaires are widely used in clinical research to gather information about disease symptoms and severity and to evaluate treatment outcomes. For example, patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be asked to complete a variety of questionnaires investigating symptom severity (Sullivan and Garden, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; McLeod and Leach, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Soble et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), quality of life (von Steinb&#x000fc;chel et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), depression (Richter et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), alcohol use (Conigrave et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), sleep disorders (Verma et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; Blanchard et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), and cognitive problems experienced in everyday life (Broadbent et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). These questionnaires are typically administered in paper and pencil format, and, in most cases, questionnaire completion is self-paced and completion time is not recorded. There has been an increase in recent years of questionnaires on PCs and tablet devices that facilitate data management and ease of administration. In addition, computer-based questionnaires permit the precise recording of QCTs to individual questions. In the current study, we evaluated the utility of QCTs as a measure of cognitive function using computer-based delivery of the questions on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; Weathers et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Blanchard et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ; Broadbent et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>).</p><p>By analyzing the completion time of individual questions, we were able to analyze the relationship between QCTs and rating scores on individual items, and between median QCTs and overall questionnaire scores. This permitted us to address two questions: (1) Would subjects take longer to respond to questions on which they gave higher disability ratings? and (2) Would subjects with greater self-reported disability show elevated QCTs? Analyzing QCTs to individual questions also permitted an analysis of the relationship between question length, grammatical complexity, and completion time. We anticipated that subjects would require more time to respond to longer and more complex questions.</p><p>In addition to examining the factors contributing to QCTs on individual questions, we analyzed the relationship between QCTs, age, and education, factors that correlate with overall questionnaire completion time (Allenby et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) as well as with performance on neuropsychological tests of processing speed (Woods et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>) and executive function (Woods et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). In addition, since female subjects typically show superior levels of verbal ability and reading achievement (Lynn and Mikk, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), we also analyzed the influence of sex. Finally, we analyzed the influence of computer use, since subjects who used computers would have more experience with processing and responding to questions delivered by computer.</p><p>We also hypothesized that QCT measures would correlate with the results of other neuropsychological tests, including measures of crystalized intelligence such as the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) (2001), tests of processing speed such as choice reaction time (CRT; Woods et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>), and tests of executive function such as the Trail Making Test, part B (Tombaugh, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Woods et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). However, insofar as the cognitive demands of questionnaire completion were similar across questionnaires, we expected higher correlations between QCTs on the two questionnaires than between QCTs and the results of the aforementioned cognitive tests.</p><p>Finally, we also analyzed the clinical sensitivity of QCT measures in a group of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who completed both questionnaires. The TBI group included 27 patients who had suffered mild TBI (mTBI), and four patients who had been hospitalized following severe TBI (sTBI). As a group, the TBI patients had shown small but significant deficits on some measures of processing speed (Hubel et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), working memory (Woods et al., under review), and executive function (Woods et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>, under review), with more severe deficits observed in sTBI than mTBI patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We studied 172 control subjects and 31 TBI patients, whose demographic characteristics are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

All patients had received complete clinical workups and diagnosis and were tested more than 1 year after their TBI incident. The patients included 30 males and one female, all between the ages of 20 and 61 years (mean age = 36.3 years), with an average of 13.6 years of formal education (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Twenty seven of the patients had suffered mTBI, with one or more combat-related incidents resulting in a cumulative loss of consciousness of less than 30 minutes, no hospitalization, and less than 24 hours of post-traumatic amnesia. Four patients had suffered sTBI with hospitalization, coma duration exceeding 8 hours, and post-traumatic amnesia exceeding 72 hours. Patient ethnicities were 71% Caucasian, 9.7% African-American, 9.7% Hispanic, 6.5% Pacific Islander, and 3.2% Asian. Additional details about the patients can be found in a companion publication (Woods et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>).</p><p>All patients and control subjects signed written consent forms approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Veterans Affairs Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS) and were paid for their participation. All subjects had completed a demographic questionnaire that included questions regarding the number of years of formal education and the number of hours per day that they used computers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Apparatus and Stimuli</title><p>The PCL and CFQ are typically self-administered, pen-and-paper tests that take 2&#x02013;5 minutes to complete. The PCL is used to assess PTSD symptoms and assist in PTSD diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Each question presents a PTSD symptom and asks the subject to rate symptom severity over the past month. Subjects complete 17 questions, each based on the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV (Foa and Tolin, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), with a 5-point Likert scale rating ranging from 1 (&#x0201c;Not at all&#x0201d;) to 5 (&#x0201c;Extremely&#x0201d;). Total scores range from 17 to 85, with interpretations based on both total score and symptom-cluster scores. There are two widely-used versions of the PCL (Weathers et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Wilkins et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>): the PCL-M, which measures military-based trauma, and the PCL-C (Conybeare et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Karstoft et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which measures trauma in civilian settings. The structure of the two questionnaires is virtually identical, with the PCL-M specifically addressing events that occurred during military service. TBI patients, all of whom were veterans, and control subjects with military experience (<italic>N</italic> = 40) were administered the PCL-M. Control subjects without military experience were given the PCL-C (<italic>N</italic> = 132).</p><p>The second questionnaire, the CFQ (Broadbent et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Bridger et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), is a 25-item survey that measures the self-reported frequency of cognitive failures on simple tasks of memory, perception, and motor function over the previous 6 months. Subjects are asked to rate the difficulty that they experienced with tasks that are not usually problematic for healthy control subjects (e.g., &#x0201c;Do you find you forget appointments?&#x0201d;) (Reason and Lucas, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). Each of the 25 questions is rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (&#x0201c;Never&#x0201d;) to 4 (&#x0201c;Very Often&#x0201d;). Interpretations are based on the total score (0&#x02013;100) and on separate factor scores (Pollina et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Wallace et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>In the current experiment, the questions from the PCL and CFQ were presented serially by computer. Subjects selected their response to each question with the mouse. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the computer display. Questionnaire completion was self-paced and subjects were not informed that their completion times would be examined. Subjects read the question and moved the mouse-controlled cursor over the Likert scale to select a rating. When the cursor was near a Likert-scale element, the corresponding response alternative was highlighted. The subject selected the desired rating (indicated by a small white square) by pressing the left mouse button, but could change their rating by selecting another Likert scale value, if desired. Once satisfied with their rating, subjects selected the &#x0201c;Submit&#x0201d; button to proceed to the next question. The time of each button press was recorded. QCTs were measured from the time of question presentation until the final submit response.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Question display</bold>. Responses were selected using the mouse cursor (green cross). As the mouse was moved over the rating scale, it highlighted Likert alternatives within a radius of 3.5 degrees of visual angle.

Here, we demonstrate that QCTs also provide a useful metric of cognitive and executive function that reflects reading speed, speed of decision making, and speed of motor execution. Importantly, QCT measures provide a metric of processing speed and executive function in a self-paced task, and hence also reflect motivation and effort as well as cognitive ability.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, QCTs correlated significantly with the results of other cognitive tests. However, stronger correlations were seen between the QCTs on the two questionnaires than between either questionnaire and other cognitive measures. This suggests that QCTs provide insights into cognitive and executive functions that are not fully captured by other common neuropsychological tests (Reitan and Wolfson, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Stages of Question Completion</title><p>Completing each question required that subjects read the question, decide on an appropriate rating, choose an appropriate response, select the chosen rating with the mouse, alter the decision if necessary by selecting a different response, and finally submit the rating before moving on to the next question. QCTs on the shortest (4&#x02013;6 word) questions averaged approximately 4.5 s. Since average reading speed was approximately five words/s, a five-word question would require about 1.0 s to read, and approximately 1.0 s was needed to move the cursor and execute the submit response. Assuming that the selection of the initial rating also required 1.0 s, subjects would appear to take approximately 1.5 s to decide on an appropriate rating. Of course, the relative timing of different processing stages would vary with question length. For example, on sentences of average length (12.1 words), reading would require approximately 2.4 s, or more than one-third of overall completion time (6.5 s).</p><p>We found that QCTs to individual questions correlated strongly with the number of words in each question, indicating that a substantial portion of QCT variance reflected the time needed to read each question. QCTs also varied with subjects&#x02019; age, which is known to influence overall questionnaire completion times (Yarnold et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Malhotra, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and reading speed (Tiu et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Borella et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Caplan et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Age also influences the speed with which subjects move the mouse cursor in the Trail Making Test (Woods et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>), whose completion times were strongly correlated with QCTs.</p><p>QCTs showed significant correlations with education, which has well-established influences on performance in cognitive tasks (Schneider et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition, QCTs were faster in women than men, consistent with a large body of evidence indicating superior female reading ability (Lynn and Mikk, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Finally, we found strong correlations between QCTs and computer use. Presumably, experienced computer users were both more familiar with manipulating the mouse and more experienced in completing computerized questionnaires. In addition, computer use correlates strongly with performance on non-computerized tests such as verbal fluency, digit span, and measures of crystallized intelligence such as the WTAR. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that age, computer use, sex, and education all had significant influences on QCT performance, with computer use exerting nearly as strong an influence as age.</p><p>Control subjects who produced higher mean questionnaire ratings, indicating higher levels of subjective cognitive impairment, showed a slight increase in QCT <italic>z</italic>-scores on the PCL, but not the CFQ, and no significant correlations were found between ratings and QCTs among TBI patients. Moreover, the QCTs of individual subjects did not correlate with disability ratings. This suggests that QCTs provide information about the speed and efficiency of questionnaire completion that is largely independent of subjective ratings.</p><p>Recent reports have called attention to the importance of developing novel instruments to assess executive function in ecologically valid settings (Lamberts et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Novakovic-Agopian et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). QCTs directly measure performance in the self-paced task of completing computerized questionnaires, and can be obtained incidentally during questionnaire administration. Moreover, since questionnaire completion is self-paced, QCTs provide insight into the utilization of cognitive resources in relatively unstructured settings (Reitan and Wolfson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) that may reflect energetical aspects of executive function (Stuss, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We found slowed QCTs of sTBI patients on the CFQ, and borderline slowing on the PCL questionnaire. We also observed larger differences between CFQ and PCL QCTs in the TBI patient group as a whole when compared to control subjects. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the TBI patients had been repeatedly exposed to paper-and-pencil versions of the PCL during their clinical evaluation and treatment; i.e., QCTs in TBI patients may have been reduced on the PCL due to their familiarity with the PCL questions. No such reduction would have occurred for the unfamiliar questions on the CFQ, explaining the difference in QCTs between the two tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>The correlations between QCTs on different questionnaires, as well as the correlations between QCTs and the results of other cognitive tests, are likely to vary with questionnaire structure and content. For example, questionnaires varying in the average number of words in each question would alter the relative contribution of reading speed to overall QCT. In addition, the distinctiveness of different response foils might change cognitive demands and alter speed/accuracy tradeoffs. For example, when asked &#x0201c;How much wine to you consume daily?&#x0201d; an individual might more rapidly choose &#x0201c;one glass&#x0201d; in comparison with &#x0201c;0.12 liters&#x0201d;. Similarly, multiple choice and &#x0201c;select all that apply&#x0201d; questions would be expected to introduce different cognitive demands than those associated with Likert scale judgments, thus adding scoring complexity due to different numbers of responses from different subjects. Finally, further studies using larger clinical populations with TBI and other neurological and psychiatric disorders are needed to more fully evaluate the utility of QCT measures of cognitive function in clinical populations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Question Completion Time provides a useful and reliable measure of cognitive and executive function that can be gathered in parallel with demographic and clinical information when questionnaires are administered. QCTs reflect reading ability, processing speed, executive control, and the ability of subjects to focus resources in a self-paced task. QCTs are largely determined by reading speed, as seen in the strong correlation between the QCTs and the number of words in individual questions. Strong correlations were also found between QCTs on two different questionnaires, which significantly exceeded the correlations of QCTs on either questionnaire with the results of other cognitive tests. This suggests that QCTs provide insight into cognitive and executive functions that complement the results of other neuropsychological instruments. Our results suggest that QCTs are prolonged in patients who have suffered severe TBI. However, additional studies with larger populations are needed to further evaluate the clinical sensitivity of QCTs to traumatic brain injury and other causes of cognitive impairments, and to determine the extent to which QCTs predict performance in other cognitively-demanding, self-paced tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>Dr. Woods is affiliated with NeuroBehavioral Systems, Inc., the developers of Presentation software used to program these experiments.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p><sup>1</sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org">sfbay.craigslist.org</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn0002"><p><sup>2</sup>The computerized versions of the PCL and CFQ questionnaires are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebire.org/hcnlab/">www.ebire.org/hcnlab/</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn0003"><p><sup>3</sup>These included the following computerized tests and questionnaires: finger tapping, simple reaction time, Stroop, digit span forward and backward, phonemic and semantic verbal fluency, verbal list learning, spatial span, trail making, design fluency, the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), visual feature conjunction, the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), and a traumatic brain injury (TBI) questionnaire.</p></fn><fn id="fn0004"><p><sup>4</sup>Data were not available on all tests from subjects who completed the questionnaires.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allenby</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Beresford</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mclachlan</surname><given-names>S.
