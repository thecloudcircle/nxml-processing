The purpose of our study was to assess risk factors for IAH and prognosis of major injured patients during burn resuscitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Adult burned patients with a burn injury exceeding 20% of total body surface area, from 1 April to 30 November 2013, were included. IAP was measured when IAH was suspected, according to the Kron method via the Foley catheter. Monitoring of IAP was performed every 6 hours during 5 days until normalization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 36 &#x000b1; 13 years. There were 14 males and six females. The average TBSA was 44 &#x000b1; 17%. Screening and monitoring of IAP were applied by: oliguria (42%), abdominal distension (31.5%) and gastrointestinal trouble (21%). IAH occurred between day 2 and day 3 after early burn resuscitation, respectively in 52% and 63%. IAH was observed in 69% of cases in patients admitted to the ICU with a delay of 1.6 days post burn injury. IAH was noted in 13 patients; of these, five patients developed an abdominal compartment syndrome. The mean IAP was 16 &#x000b1; 7 mmHg. Patients were assigned into two groups: G1 (IAH+; <italic>n </italic>= 13) and G2 (IAH-; <italic>n </italic>= 7). Comparative study of the two groups shows that HIA increases significantly body weight gain within the first 5 days after injury: 8 kg for G1 versus 2 kg for G2 (<italic>P </italic>= 0.04), occurrence of ARDS (70% for G1 vs. 16.7% for G2, <italic>P </italic>= 0.02), respiratory failure (77% for G1 vs. 28.5% for G2, <italic>P </italic>= 0.06), shock (70% for G1 vs. 16.7% for G2, <italic>P </italic>0.02) and mortality (61.5% vs. 50%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>IAH was frequent in early burn resuscitation of major injured patients. It seems to be associated with fluid overload in burns and contributes to organ damage.</p></sec></body></article>
