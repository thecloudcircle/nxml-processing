We painted the classic black soccer shoes in six areas corresponding to six regions of the foot with which it is possible to interact with the ball. Thirty-four 7-years-old soccer players were randomized to two groups (Coloured n = 17 and Black, n = 17) to perform four basic football manoeuvres/tasks: reception (RECP), passing (PASS), ball management (MAGT), and shooting (SHOT). We found highly significant differences (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) in all four performance tests: mean(sd) RECP: 0.82(0.07) vs. 0.45(0.12); PASS: 0.85(0.07) vs. 0.47(0.09); MAGT: 0.91(0.09); SHOT: 1.00(1.00) vs. 0.44(0.16). Colored shoes appear to draw children&#x02019;s attention away from body centered cues without explicit verbal communications. We propose that this cognitive adaptation enhanced the technical gesture by preventing the negative processes associated with action constraining when adopting an internal focus attention (perhaps by allowing the foot to adapt to surfaces and movements more naturally than conditions that promote a focus on the body movement). Consequently, this type of coloured footwear could be used during childhood to allow children to enhance the performance of basic football exercises through preventing action constraining and promoting intuitive (non-body centered) action knowledge.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and/or its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and/or its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soccer is a team sport where players are confronted with complex movements such as running with rapid changes of direction, with or without ball; and various kicking actions in specific and rapidly changing planes [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, tactical skills are highly dependent on the interaction of the player with the surrounding information (constantly picking information&#x02019;s from the ball, teammates and opponents), and his ability to anticipate future events is an integral part of skilled performance. As such a number of essential skills are needed to play soccer, such as physical characteristics, physiological demands, running economy, and cognitive abilities (tactical/strategic; perceptual/decision-making) that control and re-arrange tasks from the nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to Gr&#x000e9;haigne and Godbout [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] strategic skills refer to elements of game play discussed in advance of the game which are designed to aid the team in organizing itself (e.g., understanding set plays, team composition) and the performers in understanding the roles of different positions. Tactical skills are player centred decisions made during the game in face the of dynamic changes (e.g., effective position shifts in response to an opponent&#x02019;s action). Accordingly, Casanova et al., [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Grehaigne and Godbout [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] propose that tactical knowledge is essentially knowledge in action because tactical skills and performance are strongly linked. Thus, the development of tactical skills (effective individually based decision making) is an complex interaction between; the players knowledge of action rules i.e., important conditions and elements required for efficient action (e.g., if I want to &#x02018;keep the ball&#x02019; I should protect the ball using my body); the rules for managing play organization i.e., principles that facilitate elaboration of a strategy (e.g., creating imbalance in ones favour), and perceptual and sensory-motor skills (i.e., the movement skills and the capabilities of players to recognize important perceptual information and act upon it). These perceptual skills consist of recognition, anticipatory cue extraction and use, visual search behavior [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and acoustic detection [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In addition, perceptual skills including advanced visual learning capacity, visual recognition, visual search behavior, and acoustic learning [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] represent the &#x0201c;game intelligence&#x0201d; capacity as described by Stratton [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Visual, acoustic and temporal aspects are important to activate the focus of attention (FOA) of the athlete. An athlete&#x02019;s FOA depends on external and internal factors that could alter learning and performance [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. According to Wulf and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], an external FOA encourages the athlete to focus on the effects of their movement on the environment, while an internal FOA encourages the athlete to think about his or her own body movement.</p><p>In this context, numerous studies have investigated the effect of different focus of attention on performance. Here, research has demonstrated that an external FOA enhances the motor learning of children and young performers compared to an internal FOA [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, Wulf and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] investigated the learning effect of an external FOA in individuals with no experience in golf practice. Specifically, the authors asked participants to focus on either the arm swing (internal focus) or on the club swing (external focus) during a pitch shot in Golf. Results demonstrated that the group who received instruction to focus on the club swing performance significantly better than the group focusing on the arm swing. This pattern of results helps confirm the benefit from using an external FOA to enhance performance in individuals with no task experience (i.e., beginners).</p><p>Zachry et al., [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also observed that participants who performed basketball free throws with instructions to focus on the basket (external FOA) had greater shot accuracy compared to participants who focused on their wrist motion (internal FOA). Furthermore, electromyography (EMG) data of the biceps and triceps muscle revealed reduced activity (more efficiency) in the external FOA group compared to the internal FOA group. Hence, it appears that an external FOA reduces &#x0201c;mechanical noise&#x0201d; and thus enhances movement economy compared to conditions that promote an internal FOA.</p><p>The benefits of adopting an external FOA over that of adopting an internal FOA has been proposed within the Constrained Action Hypothesis (CAH) [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Broadly speaking, two mechanisms are at play when attributing the benefits of an external over an internal FOA. 1) an internal FOA acts to constrain the normal automatic processes of movement and 2) an external FOA serves to enhance the congruity between action planning and movement outcome and thus increases the action-effect principle [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Evidence for such effects can be seen in the research of [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here, baseball players who focused on an external irrelevant feature (i.e., participants who were prevented from focusing on the movements of the body but <italic>not</italic> explicitly told to focus on the effect of their movement) performed better than those required to focus internally, but not as well as those required to focus on the action of their movement. Thus, it appears that action performance can be enhanced by simply preventing an internal FOA, but enhanced further if that prevention also includes a strategy that focus attention of the effect of the action. In most previous studies, the strategy used to manipulate the external focus is done so through the use of explicit verbal instructions [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or visual cues [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to Gottlieb [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], attention to visual information searching is an important component of the cognitive system. During exercise, the motor system organizes itself towards the optimal movement pattern after receiving visual information. Since this process has been demonstrated to be easier for an expert or high level athlete compared to a beginner [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it appears important to give clear and easy instructions to novice players [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] if performance benefits are the desired goal. For example, when a target is defined by a specific feature (i.e. form or colour) a young player and/or novice tend to respond quickly and more accurately regardless to the task [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this context, Gibson [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], described the affordance concept as the process of constant characteristics of specific objects (i.e. form, size, color, texture, composition, motion, animation, and position relative to other objects) being directly perceived by the observer resulting in the presentation of the objects affordances. In other words, &#x0201c;Affordance&#x0201d; theory [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] explains the ability of the motor system to guide behavior or actions via interactions with the environment which results in directly perceiving what the environment offers in terms of potential and possible &#x0201c;action&#x0201d;. This theory describes a strong interaction between individual&#x02019;s action and environment characteristic. However, the selection of affordances seems to face the problem of acquisition and development of actions in children, since maturity is a crucial element in the &#x0201c;perception-action&#x0201d; cycle [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and affordances are partly determined by the performers action abilities [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, if an external FOA enhances the action capabilities of a learner by preventing the proposed action constraining effects [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] of adopting an internal FOA, it is feasible that relatively more affordances are perceived under conditions of an external FOA.</p><p>Because children and novices are often in the cognitive stage of learning [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] their ability to pay attention to coaches instructions is limited relative to more intermediate and advanced performers. This is said to be because in early stages of learning performers are still trying to work out &#x02018;what&#x02019; to do and &#x02018;what&#x02019; is required of them and their motor system which consumes considerable attentional resources (see [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) As such, it is important to develop new strategies or interventions to improve attention in this population. As such, improving attention through the development of the child&#x02019;s visual search and target recognition strategies could be beneficial to the learning process in general. For example, recent literature using coloured targets such as colourful sport clothes and footwear have shown the importance of colour in enhancing mood, emotions, and even behavior. In fact, colour has been found to enhance individual&#x02019;s arousal [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Wright [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] explained the effect of the electro-magnetic radiation of light on mood and behavior. He suggested that warm colour such as yellow, blue, green or red have a strong impact on the nervous systems response as they have the potential to stimulate the &#x0201c;hyperarousal&#x0201d; process (activation of stress hormones). For example, the uniform colour of goalkeepers (red vs. white) could influence the number of penalties scored [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In fact, penalty takers wearing red were perceived to possess positive characteristics to a greater extent than those wearing white. Moreover, goalkeepers reported higher expectancies of saving penalties from penalty takers wearing white uniforms than any other colour combination. These previous research articles investigating colour were focused on clothing colours while the colour of the shoe was not given consideration. There is one exception whereby Lam et al., [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] demonstrated that anaerobic performances (e.g., jump flight time) are enhanced in individuals wearing <italic>warm</italic> coloured shoes. In the game of soccer, the shoes (weight, form) are important for running and consequently playing ability [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As such they may well be perceived by the wearer as important for locomotor or action ability and thus partly determine the perceived affordances of the environment [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, since strategies that prevent performers from focusing on their body actions result in an increase in action ability [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is possibility that using coloured shoes to prevent an Internal FOA may lead to increases in performance. Which in turn lead to increases in action ability and thus greater affordances compared to situations that promote an internal FOA.

All subjects were moderately trained and performed a one-year preparation in the local club. In addition, to identify those with a medical contraindication (exclusion criteria) to performing tests, participants completed medical history, and dietary, questionnaires.

The shoe was divided into six squares / anatomical areas: toe tip (white); inner foot (red); outer foot (yellow); heel (magenta); sole (black); foot neck (blue).

This intervention intended to help recognize all parts of the foot intuitively and to decrease the time of execution in basic football exercises in young soccer. Results indicated that players wearing coloured shoes performed significantly better (i.e. reception, shooting, passing and ball management tasks) than their counterparts in the control group.</p><p>Similar results were also reported by numerous studies. In fact, it has been found that golf performance was increased when focus was directed on either the swing of the club, the clubface, or the intended ball trajectory rather than on the wrist movement [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] or arms [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In basketball, higher scores in free throw performance were registered in the group who focused attention on ball trajectory relative to basket compared to group who focused attention on the gesture (i.e., upper leg movement and, in particular, of the wrist [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). In football, higher hitting performance was recorded when subject&#x02019;s attention is directed to the part of the ball required to strike (i.e., external stimuli) rather than the part of the foot they would have to use to make contact with the ball (i.e., internal [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).</p><p>Many researchers have confirmed the strong impact of the external FOA on the effectiveness and accuracy of motor performance [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and on the speed of the learning process [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the current study, when the performer was required to direct their attention to the targeted colour of the shoe, they are prevented from directing their attention to the movements themselves (internal feedback) which had greater impact on decreasing the task execution time. Wulf, and Colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] advocate that two mechanisms are at play when attributing the benefits of an external over an internal FOA. 1) an internal FOA acts to constrain the normal automatic processes of movement and 2) an external FOA serves to enhance the congruity between action planning and movement outcome and thus increases the action-effect principle [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As hypothesized, it appears that the colour condition in the current experiment acted to prevent the first process from happening, resulting in increased performance relative to the internal FOA condition. That is, the colour intervention prevented or reduced the constraining effects associated with adopting an explicit internal (body centered) focus of attention (internal FOA). In line with this suggestion, previous literature [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] indicates that adopting an environmental focus (i.e., a focus that is outside of the body, but not explicitly centered toward the effects of a movement e.g., focusing on an auditory tone, focusing on footwear colour and its contact with the ball) results in greater performance compared to adopting an internal FOA. In a similar vein, Lawrence et al., [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that under both internal and external FOA conditions participants create a comparable number of explicit cues/rules regarding the movement technique. The performance benefits of adopting an external FOA in Lawrence et al., [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were attributed to these explicit cues/rules being environmental focused and not body centered (thus preventing the constraining processes proposed within the CAH) in the external FOA condition. Whilst the current experiment did not measure the number or type of explicitly generated cues/rules, it is possible that the benefits of the Colour condition over that of the IFOA condition are due, in part, to this effect. Whilst the benefits of an EFOA that is directed toward a movement effect (e.g., the manipulations of Wulf and Colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) is proposed to be due to both preventing action constraining and enhancing action planning via processes within the action-effect principle (see [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), our colour manipulation did not directly asks participants to focus on a movement effect. However, we still observed increased performance relative to the internal FOA group. As such, the performance benefits of the Colour condition over that of the IFOA condition are likely due to the condition <italic>only</italic> preventing the constraining processes proposed to occur when one adopts an IFOA rather than the additional action-effect principles associated with adopting a focus that directs attention to the effects of one&#x02019;s movement.</p><p>The use of color as a target for attraction appears to have excellent impact on learning process and memory [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As we know, cognitive skills depend on perception, attention, memory and the way of thinking of an individual. Therefore, to facilitate this process, there must be intervention/method to facilitate &#x0201c;perception&#x0201d; first through exposing eye to attractive information (i.e. light). In fact, when persons are exposed to different colors and pictures, they were attracted &#x0201c;spontaneously&#x0201d; to warm colours (red, blue, green, yellow [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, this is said that children and novices are in early stages of learning and are thus still trying to work out &#x02018;what&#x02019; to do and &#x02018;what&#x02019; is required of them and their motor system which consumes considerable attentional resources (see [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). As such, it is important to develop new strategies to improve attention and memory in this population. There is evidence that visual memory and recognition are more robust than auditory memory [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The rationale being that the auditory received verbal instruction, has to be transformed into wave information, travel across the auditory system before being transformed into electric impulse to be recognized by the brain. Hence, to recognize the part of the foot to use during hitting ball, the verbal instruction of the coach must pass through a complex system. However, when the task is combined with visual searching for example (choosing the part of the foot to hit the ball, how to hit the ball and direction of the goal), the perception system will focus on the most vital task and then the information that should be treated first will be chosen according to level of motivation, attention and concentration. This suggests that visual information will be process/treated first. Since this strategy is more useful for beginner due the reduced attention compared with a high level athlete [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], we propose that the colour condition aided in performance strategy similar to that proposed above which impacted towards our observed performance gains. Furthermore, in relation to Fajen and Matthis [<xref rid="pone.0200689.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] action-scaled affordances approach, we speculate that this increase in performance and locomotor action, lead to the direct perception of a greater number of affordances compared to the internal FOA group. That is, if the number of possible actions (i.e., affordances) are partly determined by the motor capabilities of the performer, then those participants in the colour group should have been afforded more possible actions as a direct result of their improved performance.</p><p>Although the findings of this study make a unique contribution to the fields of exercise science and motor learning, it is worth mentioning that the current research used basic football tasks that are not representative of the dynamic and multifaceted game of soccer. Indeed, it was not the intension of the experiment that the research design promote external validity over internal validity; these two concepts are paradoxical in nature whereby increasing one results in a reduction in the other. However, the central point of the investigation (the manipulation of footwear colour as a way to prevent an internal FOA) was novel within the FOA scientific literature. As such, we deemed it essential to adopt an experimental design that allowed for as rigorous internal validity as possible whilst still adopting tasks that were relevant to the game of soccer; if not completely representative of the game itself. The rationale being that, in order to establish the hypothesized cause and effect of a coloured footwear intervention enhancing performance over that of an internal FOA we needed to &#x02018;sacrifice&#x02019; external validity in favour of internal validity. As such, the results should be applied to soccer with caution until they are tested in an externally valid experimental design that uses tasks representative of the complete dynamic and multifaceted real-world game of soccer.</p><p>Apparently, these quick adjustments in performance (short-term changes) in our participants are due to enhancement of temporary storage of information. Since, colour is easier to understand than verbal communication, we assumed that this temporary storage of information would allow the information to be used for ongoing mental processes. As such, long-term studies should be addressed to assess how young players technical performance could be improved across a long-period. In addition, the use of the external focus of attention during game would become an essential element of training and can be simply included in different situations to enhance young soccer player performance.</p><p>On the other hand, current findings may provide the most informative approach given the need to study the physiological process that lie behind these improvements and if possible to adapt this strategy in young player regardless to their gender. In fact, it will inform policy and practical solutions for coaches during training sessions especially at the beginning of the season to facilitate motor learning in young players (&#x02264;14 years). In addition, this intervention maybe an easy digestible strategy for individuals with hearing impairment or might have trouble understanding verbal instructions and extend theory in health community as a motivational intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the current study has clearly demonstrated that coloured shoes have a positive effect on motor performance relative to conditions that promote an internal FOA. We suggest this occurs because of the interactive effects of the coloured shoe acting to prevent an internal (body centered) FOA, resulting in actions that are not constrained, and therefore providing the direct perception of a greater number of affordances in comparison to an explicit verbal instruction group that promotes the adoption of an internal FOA. Whilst these results are promising to the world of soccer as a simple coaching &#x02018;tool&#x02019; designed to improve the performance of youth players, the current research used basic football tasks. As such, until the intervention tested in an externally valid experimental design that uses tasks representative of the complete dynamic and multifaceted real-world game of soccer, the findings should be applied to with caution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200689.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Colour subdivisions of the shoe.</title><p>The image represents the exact subdivisions of the shoe.
