Most studies have described the phenomena of neurochemical production by bacteria, but there remains an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms by which microbe- or host-derived neuroactive substances can be recognized by bacteria. Based on the evolutionary origins of eukaryotic solute carrier transporters, we hypothesized that bacteria may possess an analogous uptake function for neuroactive biogenic amines. Using specific fluorescence-based assays, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> biofilms appear to express both plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT)- and organic cation transporter (OCT)-like uptake of transporter-specific fluorophores. This phenomenon is not distributed throughout the genus <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> as <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rhamnosus</italic> biofilms did not take up these fluorophores. PMAT probe uptake into <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salivarius</italic> biofilms was attenuated by the protonophore CCCP, the cation transport inhibitor decynium-22, and the natural substrates norepinephrine, serotonin and fluoxetine. These results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for the existence of PMAT- and OCT-like uptake systems in a bacterium. They also suggest the existence of a hitherto unrecognized mechanism by which a probiotic bacterium may interact with host signals and may provide a means to examine microbial endocrinology-based interactions in health and disease that are part of the larger microbiota-gut-brain axis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009896</institution-id><institution>U.S. Navy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N000141512706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8512-2581</contrib-id><name><surname>Lyte</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Metagenics Inc.</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8512-2581</contrib-id><name><surname>Lyte</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Department of Defense, Office of Naval research grant #N000141512706 (to M.L.) and by a grant from Metagenics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metagenics.com">www.metagenics.com</ext-link>), Aliso Viejo, CA (to M.L.).

Among these molecules are the primary amines norepinephrine (NE), dopamine, histamine, tyramine and serotonin (SER), which are synthesized and function as paracrine mediators and neurotransmitters within animal hosts [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a large and growing number of studies, the neurotransmitter NE in particular has been shown to act directly on many bacterial species to enhance their growth and virulence characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Tyramine, a chemically-related trace amine, also influences bacterial growth and interactions with intestinal epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191037.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some bacterial species, notably <italic>Lactobacilli</italic>, are known to synthesize biogenic amines that can interact with trace amine receptors and thereby affect their animal hosts, including agmatine, histamine, &#x000df;-phenylethylamine, and tyramine [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, enteric microbes have recently been shown to modulate serotonin concentrations in gut luminal fluid [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Biogenic amines such as NE, dopamine and serotonin are taken up by mammalian cells through plasma membrane cation transporters, which are members of a large family of solute carrier (SLC) transport proteins [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Specific transport proteins for these neurotransmitter substances are members of the <italic>SLC6</italic> gene family and are expressed on neural membranes where they mediate Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent transmitter uptake from synaptic zones by a process referred to as &#x0201c;uptake-1&#x0201d;. A second, unrelated group of transport proteins are expressed in non-neuronal cells, which take up extracellular biogenic amines and other cationic substances through an uptake-2 process. Analogs of some of these latter eukaryotic transporters are expressed in prokaryotes. Analogous bacterial glutamate and leucine transporters have been discovered that have informed studies of the structure-function relationships of eukaryotic SLC transporters [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191037.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This raises the question of whether bacteria residing in the gut lumen express uptake systems that would permit them to acquire and accumulate neuroactive serotonin, NE or related transmitter substances. It has been hypothesized that probiotic bacteria may act as carriers of these substances [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined monoamine uptake into <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> biofilms using fluorescent probes for membrane amine transport. Numerous studies have provided evidence that biofilm-forming lactobacilli have multiple beneficial effects on digestive health [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The cationic fluorescent probes IDT307 and ASP<sup>+</sup> were used as well-defined substrates for membrane-associated &#x0201c;uptake-2&#x0201d; amine transporters in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IDT307 ((4-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide) is a fluorescent derivative of 1-methyl-1-phenylpyridinium, a specific substrate for the uptake-2 plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) encoded on the <italic>SLC29A4</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. IDT307 has recently been used to screen potential PMAT inhibitors, including those which suppress serotonin uptake through the low affinity, high capacity serotonin transporter, the molecular target of fluoxetine and other common antidepressant drugs [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The chemically-related fluorescent cationic substance, ASP<sup>+</sup> (4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide), has been used as a specific substrate for the three defined organic cation transporters (OCTs) encoded in the <italic>SLC22</italic> gene family [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These latter polyspecific transporters mediate the uptake of cationic drugs, endogenous amines and other substrates into neurons and other mammalian cell types. The results of the present study suggest that some <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> biofilms express functional homologs of PMAT and OCTs, which could take up and potentially deliver bioactive amines to neighboring microbes or host cells in the intestinal tract.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bacterial strains, culture conditions and reagents</title><p><italic>L</italic>. <italic>salivarius</italic> (type strain #11741, American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD) and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rhamnosus</italic> (kind gift of M. Bailey, Nationwide Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Columbus, OH) were maintained as frozen stocks. Reconfirmation of all strain identities prior to initiation of experiments was performed using MALDI-TOF (Bruker Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). The selection of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salivarius</italic> as the prototypical microorganism to examine for the present study was based on its well-recognized ability to positively influence health and disease outcomes, such as those involving the microbiota-gut-brain axis, in a diverse group of animal species (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191037.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). As well, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rhamnosus</italic> was utilized as a comparator strain as it has also been employed in similar studies [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cultures were grown in Lactobacilli MRS broth (product #288130, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) from frozen stock the previous night in static culture in a 37&#x000b0;C humidified incubator. 4-(4-Diethylaminostyryl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP<sup>+</sup>; product #D-3418), 4-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide (IDT307; product #SML0756, as well as other drugs and chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in double distilled water prior to use with the exception of carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, product #C2759) that was dissolved in ethanol with further dilution in IMDM to a final concentration in 0.5% ethanol in experiments. Decynium-22 (product #D4486) was purchased from TCI Chemicals (Portland, OR, USA) and was prepared in ethanol with further dilution in IMDM to a final concentration in 0.2% ethanol in experiments. All prepared solutions were sterile filtered prior to use and used at concentrations indicated in the text and figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>PMAT and OCT fluorescence-based assays</title><p>For measurement of PMAT-like transport, the IDT307 fluorophore-based Neurotransmitter Uptake Assay Kit (product #R8173, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used with modification. Similarly, for measurement of OCT-like transport, the ASP<sup>+</sup> fluorophore was used in an assay identical to that for IDT307. These fluorophore-based assays, which we employed to examine putative neurotransmitter transporter activity in bacteria, employ the same approach utilized in mammalian cell culture to identify pharmaceutical compounds that target the activity of the biogenic amine transporters that are responsible for the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of this assay design has proved instrumental in the identification and design of pharmaceutical compounds to treat depression and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, there are no reports that this assay design has been utilized with bacteria. In brief, the assay utilizes a fluorophore, either IDT307 or ASP<sup>+</sup>, in combination with a fluorescence masking agent, trypan blue. The fluorophores, which are actively taken into the cell via the PMAT (IDT307 fluorophore) or OCT (ASP<sup>+</sup> fluorophore) transporters and thus mimic dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, are readily detectable by fluorescence using a bottom read detection mode. The presence of the masking agent completely quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophore only when it is adjacent to the fluorophore. Since the size of the masking agent, trypan blue, precludes its active uptake into the cell, only fluorophores that have been taken up by the cell via the transporter will be detected and that which is present in the extracellular fluid in the presence of the masking dye will be quenched and not detected. It is also important to note that the assay requires the use of a bottom read mode. The use of mammalian cells which are capable of attachment to the bottom of the well to form a monolayer is thus required for the read which was why bacterial biofilms were employed in this study.</p><p>As it is intended for studies with mammalian cells, the kit recommends the use of phenol red-free Hank&#x02019;s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). For the results shown in this report, we substituted phenol red-free Iscove&#x02019;s Modified Dulbecco&#x02019;s Medium (IMDM; product #21056&#x02013;023, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for HBSS. Preliminary work showed that no transporter activity in bacterial biofilms could be detected with the use of HBSS (discussed further in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Results</xref> section). IMDM was selected as it is a nutrient-rich, protein-free medium used in tissue culture that allows for robust <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of a wide variety of mammalian cell types in the absence of any protein additives common to most microbiology media. Its use has even extended to the culture of parasites [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191037.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similar tissue culture media, such as FluoroBrite DMEM (product #A1896701; Life Technologies), produced similar results to those obtained with IMDM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191037.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>At the start of the assay, 0.2 ml of stationary phase overnight bacterial growth was inoculated into 9.8 ml of pre-warmed deMan, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS), thoroughly mixed, and 0.2 ml aliquots added to individual wells of Corning flat and clear-bottomed 96 well microplates (product #3904, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA). Plates were then placed into a 37&#x000b0;C humidified incubator. Following static incubation for either 6- or 24-hours, plates were removed from the incubator and the well supernatants were gently removed leaving the bacterial biofilm intact on the bottom surface of the individual clear plate wells. Subsequently, the PMAT-specific fluorophore IDT307 (Molecular Devices) or the OCT-specific fluorophore ASP<sup>+</sup> (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in IMDM and pre-warmed to 37&#x000b0;C was gently added to appropriate wells (added along the well side so as not to disturb the biofilm). The plate was immediately placed into a BioTek Synergy H1 reader (Winooski, VT, USA) and measured using Gen5 software at the time intervals shown in the figures. All assays were done at 37&#x000b0;C unless otherwise noted and reads were performed as bottom fluorescence in relative fluorescence units (RTU). For IDT307, the chemical and masking dye were added in pre-measured amounts as supplied by the manufacturer and the amount of IMDM used as a diluent was the same as indicated for the use of HBSS. For ASP<sup>+</sup>, the dye and masking solution were prepared as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0191037.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with the following minor modification: 100 &#x003bc;l of a 2 mg ASP<sup>+</sup> stock solution per ml of distilled water was first added to 9.9 ml of IMDM and mixed, followed by the addition of 10 &#x003bc;l of a 10 mM Trypan blue solution. The excitation/emission wavelengths used for IDT307 and ASP<sup>+</sup>, respectively, were 440 nm/520 nm and 475 nm/609 nm.</p><p>As indicated above, IMDM was employed for the preparation of both the IDT307 and ASP<sup>+</sup> fluorophores. This was in place of HBSS as the recommended fluorophore diluent since preliminary experiments utilizing HBSS for the preparation of IDT307 did not yield measurable levels of fluorophore uptake. The use of IMDM media likely provided a richer environment for maintaining bacterial function than HBSS, which is a simple minimal salt solution. Additionally, personal communication with Molecular Devices Technical Services staff confirmed that the use of HBSS had only been validated using eukaryotic cells that were stably transfected with human dopamine, NE or serotonin uptake 1 transporters.

However, peak fluorescence did not appear to be temperature-sensitive, suggesting that temperature affected uptake kinetics but not intracellular capacity for the fluorophore. In addition to its temperature sensitivity, uptake of the PMAT probe was abolished in biofilms pretreated with the metabolic inhibitor, sodium nitrite. As nitrite is a rather non-selective inhibitor of transport, we additionally examined the effects of the specific protonophore CCCP on IDT307 uptake in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salivarius</italic> biofilms. As with nitrite ions, CCCP completely inhibited the uptake of this fluorophore into biofilms.

Moreover, the biogenic amines NE and serotonin similarly attenuated IDT307-associated uptake and peak fluorescence intensity in the biofilms, a result suggestive of competitive interactions with the fluoroprobes for cellular uptake. Finally, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine abolished fluorophore uptake into early and established <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salivarius</italic> biofilms at concentrations in the high micromolar range.
