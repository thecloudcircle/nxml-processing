Several models are employed to study activated human neutrophils akin to those found at a site of inflammation. These include whole blood (WB) <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and <italic>in vivo</italic> techniques: cantharidin blister, skin windows and intra-dermal injection of UV-killed <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> (UVKEc). Neutrophils obtained from these have never been compared. We compared the activation status of neutrophils from each technique in order to inform the optimal model for use in human studies. Healthy male volunteers were randomised to undergo one of the four techniques (n = 5/group). LPS: WB stimulated with 1ng/ml of LPS for 4 hours. Cantharidin: 12.5&#x003bc;l of 0.1% cantharidin elicited a single blister, aspirated at 24 hours. Skin windows: four 6mm mechanical-suction blisters created, de-roofed and an exudate-collection chamber placed over the windows for 4 hours before aspiration. UVKEc: 1.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> UVKEc injected intra-dermally. A single 10mm mechanical-suction blister formed and aspirated at 4 hours. Unstimulated WB used as the control. Flow cytometry was used to determine activation status using CD16, CD11b, CD54, CD62L and CD88. Functional status was assessed with a phagocytosis assay. The pattern of neutrophil activation was similar in all models. Neutrophil CD11b was elevated in all models, most markedly in UVKEc (p&#x0003c;0.0001), and CD54 was also elevated but only significant in the LPS model (p = 0.001). CD62L was significantly reduced in all 4 models (p&#x0003c;0.0001) and CD88 was also suppressed in all. There were no changes in CD16 in any model, neither was there any significant difference in the phagocytic capacity of the neutrophils. In summary, there are no significant differences in activation marker expression or phagocytic capacity in the neutrophils obtained from each technique. Therefore we believe whole blood stimulation is the best model in experimentally challenging inpatient populations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M005291/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilroy</surname><given-names>Derek W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The Medical Research Council UK gave funding to grant number MR/M005291/1.

Defects in neutrophil function have been implicated in a wide range of diseases, from congenital syndromes such as Chronic Granulomatous Disease [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] through to acquired defects in an array of conditions including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], Crohn&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Sepsis [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and Cirrhotic Liver Disease [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, human neutrophil function has been investigated <italic>ex vivo</italic> following isolation from fresh blood. This allows for large numbers of cells to be harvested and a wide array of phenotypic and functional studies to be performed for each study participant. However, circulating neutrophils have been shown to have significantly different characteristics to those found at inflammatory sites or organs. For example, compared to circulating, inflammatory site neutrophils have altered expression of cell-surface proteins including shedding of L-selectin (CD62L) and up-regulation of the constitutively-expressed integrins: LFA1 (&#x003b2;2 integrin CD11a complexed with CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b complexed with CD18) [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These changes result in &#x02018;priming&#x02019; of neutrophils, enhancing their key functions such as phagocytosis and oxidative burst to improve their bactericidal ability [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Thus, obtaining primed and steady state neutrophils is vital when studying their role in health and disease. A common and straight-forward method of achieving this is to stimulate whole-blood (WB) <italic>ex vivo</italic> with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)[<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, neutrophils stimulated in this manner have not been recruited to a site of inflammation from the circulation and have therefore not undergone the active process of tethering, rolling, adherence, and trans-migration through the endothelium [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In the age of translational biomedical research, human models that allow the study of neutrophils obtained from an environment more akin to an inflamed extravascular compartment are employed. Such models include the cantharidin blister [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] skin windows (generated by de-roofing blisters formed by negative suction) [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and most recently described, intra-dermal (i.d.) injection of UV-killed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (UVKEc) and subsequent blister formation over the site of injection [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While these models provide a way to acquire neutrophils that best represent this activated state, they do come with a cost in terms of acceptability to volunteers.</p><p>It has not been shown whether the primed neutrophils obtained from each of these three dermal models differ significantly from those primed by <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with LPS, or indeed from each other. This information would aid selection of the most appropriate method for obtaining primed neutrophils for human studies.</p><p>In this paper we present data comparing the activation state of neutrophils obtained from the three dermal models of acute inflammation compared with WB stimulation with LPS. Employing flow cytometric analysis we demonstrate that the pattern of neutrophil cell-surface activation markers is similar across all four models and that there is no significant difference in the phagocytic capacity of the neutrophils obtained. Given the additional complexity of performing the dermal models relative to WB stimulation with LPS, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model in detail.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Young, healthy, non-smoking male volunteers between the ages of 18&#x02013;45 were recruited.

The most marked and consistent change across all models was the reduction in CD62L expression. This was anticipated, given that both the process of endothelial trans-migration (dermal models), and stimulation with LPS, are known to result in shedding of CD62L [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Shedding of CD62L plays a key role in regulating neutrophil migration as the resulting soluble ectodomain has a local anti-inflammatory effect [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The reduction in CD88 (C5a receptor) expression was also consistent, but more variable. Previous studies have shown that neutrophil priming, by stimulation with TNF&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or by non-inflammatory trans-migration to the lung [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], is associated with down-regulation of CD88. This was most marked in the cantharidin model&#x02013;possibly due to the later time-point employed.</p><p>CD11b (Integrin alpha M) is part of the Mac-1 integrin that mediates adherence to the endothelium. Its expression is well-recognised marker of neutrophil activation [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our data showed that this was elevated in all 4 models, but particularly high in the UVKEc-blister model. This may correlate with the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines generated in each model. TNF&#x003b1; levels in the UVKEc-blister model have be measured at 1000pg/ml [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], whereas the levels in the cantharidin blister (70pg/ml) [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and skin-window models (approx. 10pg/ml) [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] are considerably less.</p><p>The trend towards increased CD54 (ICAM) expression, did not reach statistical significance in any of the dermal models but modest rises in its expression in trans-migrated neutrophils is in keeping with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The functional significance of neutrophil priming has been extensively demonstrated previously [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

However, BAL is an invasive technique requiring the relevant clinical training and experience. On the other hand, the models that we employed are minimally invasive and can be performed safely without the specialist clinical training and facilities required for BAL. Given that the activation pattern of neutrophils from all models were similar, the selection of the most appropriate model for obtaining primed neutrophils should be based on other considerations. Therefore, the major features of each of the models will now be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>I.d. injection of UVKEc</title><p>We consider the i.d. injection of UVKEc to be the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; inflammation model that we used. It elicits the cardinal clinical signs of inflammation including redness, heat, swelling and pain and at the 4-hour time-point peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8 and IL-6 are observed [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The neutrophils trans-migrate the endothelium, are subject to the full inflammatory milieu and encounter bacteria. Consistent with this, the neutrophils appeared the most activated, with the highest expression of CD11b and suppression of CD88.</p><p>The model also allows the full time-course of inflammation to be investigated [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The negative aspects of this model are that the associated pain and swelling may not be well tolerated by some subjects (particularly unwell patients) and neutrophil exposure to UVKEc renders the phagocytosis assay uninterpretable.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>ECC and Cantharidin</title><p>Whereas the ECC model produces a cellular profile very similar to that of the i.d. UVKEc model at the same time-point (4 hours), the profile obtained from the cantharidin blisters is significantly different with a large number of monocytes and lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This difference reflects the stage of inflammation, with the 24-hour time-point used in cantharidin representing the monocyte-driven resolution phase.</p><p>Neither of these models result in the cardinal clinical signs of inflammation as both are driven by superficial, local tissue damage and activation of neutrophils in these models is not augmented by additional stimulation (e.g. LPS or bacteria).</p><p>Although the pattern of activation markers was very similar between the two models, the phagocytosis data suggests that the neutrophils from cantharidin are functionally more active. This may be a result of the infiltrating monocytes present in the cantharidin blister contributing to the inflammatory milieu by producing TNF&#x003b1; as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Both models have previously been used to investigate functional defects in neutrophils. For example, Tritto <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated neutrophil phagocytic dysfunction in patients with cirrhotic liver disease using a version of the ECC model [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Harbord <italic>et al</italic> used cantharidin blisters to investigate defects in neutrophil trafficking and chemotaxis in patients with Crohn&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>A potential unique feature of the ECC model is the ability to modify the fluid that is introduced into the four chambers. For example, inflammatory stimulants such as LPS or UVKEc, or pharmacological agents may be added to investigate the effect of these on neutrophil activation <italic>in vivo</italic> without significant systemic absorption and side effects. In contrast, cantharidin cannot be modified, but is a far simpler model to use and is well tolerated by the majority of subjects. Given the cellular profile and time-point the model lends itself to investigating the resolution of inflammation and allows the study of monocytes as well as neutrophils. It is also worth considering that cantharidin acts as a protein phosphatase 1 [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and 2A inhibitor [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This may have unforeseen downstream effects on the acute inflammatory response particular to this method of eliciting blisters and their cellular content.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>WB Stimulation with LPS</title><p>Although this model is represents the least physiological means of obtaining primed neutrophils, the data suggests a similar phenotypic picture to dermal models.</p><p>This model has several obvious advantages. Firstly, the number of cells that can be obtained is substantially higher, meaning more functional assays can be performed. Secondly, taking blood is straightforward, quick and well tolerated by subjects whereas all the other models are more complex and incompatible with acutely unwell patients. Thirdly, other inflammatory cells aside from neutrophils can be studied, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines can be used as a proxy read-out for immune function [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These features explain why the model has been used far more extensively than the dermal models to study neutrophils in the acutely unwell patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study was limited by several factors. Firstly, there were a limited number of healthy subjects enrolled in each group [<xref rid="pone.0165502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although in total, 27 subjects were involved in the study, recruitment was a challenge. Even to healthy volunteers, the dermal models are a relatively invasive process. The low numbers had a particular impact on the phagocytosis data, as clear trends between groups did not reach statistical significance. A wide range of potential assays is available for testing the function of neutrophils, both in terms of migration and in terms of phagocytosis and pathogen killing. These include studying respiratory burst, chemotaxis, chemokinesis and bacterial killing assays. We only employed a single assay of neutrophil function due to the low cell numbers obtained in the blister models. Had it been possible to include more subjects, other assays as mentioned above would have been of interest and may have elucidated subtle differences between the neutrophils in the models used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have compared the activation and function of human neutrophils in 3 dermal models of acute inflammation and contrasted this with <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation of WB with LPS.
