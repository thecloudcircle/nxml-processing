However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we reported that miR-126 was expressed in mouse and human Tregs. Further study showed that silencing of miR-126 using miR-126 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) could significantly reduce the induction of Tregs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, miR-126 silencing could obviously reduce the expression of Foxp3 on Tregs, which was accompanied by decreased expression of CTLA-4 and GITR, as well as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;, and impair its suppressive function. Mechanistic evidence showed that silencing of miR-126 enhanced the expression of its target p85&#x003b2; and subsequently altered the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, which was ultimately responsible for reduced induction and suppressive function of Tregs. Finally, we further revealed that miR-126 silencing could impair the suppressive function of Tregs <italic>in vivo</italic> and endow effectively antitumour effect of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in adoptive cell transfer assay using a murine breast cancer model. Therefore, our study showed that miR-126 could act as fine-tuner in regulation of PI3K-Akt pathway transduction in the induction and sustained suppressive function of Tregs and provided a novel insight into the development of therapeutic strategies for promoting T-cell immunity by regulating Tregs through targeting specific miRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MiR-126</kwd><kwd>CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>AKT</kwd><kwd>Adoptive cell transfer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subpopulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells which constitutively expressed transcription factor forkhead box protein3 (Foxp3), consist of 5&#x02013;10% peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in normal human and mice. A large body of literatures showed that Tregs played a critical role in various immune diseases through regulating the function of conventional CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. Foxp3 plays a critical role in development and function of Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Foxp3 is sufficient, in certain experimental settings, to impart suppressive function to conventional CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. The intrinsic mechanisms is described that Foxp3 coordinates the Treg cell gene expression program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recent evidence showed that limited PI3K-Akt pathway played a critical role in the expression of Foxp3 and subsequently regulated the induction and suppressive function of Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. Efficient Foxp3 induction requires proteins that limit PI3K activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. Consistently, constitutive Akt activity not only interfered with Foxp3 induction in CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells but also impaired the suppressive function of Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. However, the exact reason why limited activation of PI3K-Akt pathway was in the induction and sustained suppressive function of Tregs is currently unclear.</p><p>MiR-126 is one of the miRNA most abundantly expressed in endothelial cells, and heart, lung and other highly vascularized murine tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. Overexpression of miR-126 could block PI3K-Akt activation, and trigger ischaemic angiogenesis, suppress tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. Recent evidence further showed that miR-126 was also functional expressed in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. And silencing of miR-126 could abrogate the function of CD4<sup>+</sup>Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. However, the possible functional role of miR-126 in Tregs remains to be elucidated. In this study, we reported that miR-126 was expressed on murine and human Tregs. Importantly, silencing of miR-126 could reduce the induction of Foxp3 in CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells and impair suppressive function of Tregs. Further evidence showed that miR-126 regulated the transduction of PI3K-Akt pathway, which ultimately influenced the induction and sustained suppressive function of Tregs. Finally, we reported that miR-126 silencing in Tregs could endow the effective antitumour effect of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in adoptive cell transfer assay. These data demonstrated a previously unknown role of miR-126 in Tregs induction and function sustainment through regulating the transduction of PI3K-Akt pathway and provided a novel insight into the development of therapeutic strategy for promoting T-cell immunity by regulating Tregs through targeting specific miRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Female Balb/c mice and Balb/c nude mice 5&#x02013;6 weeks of age were purchased from the Center of Experimental Animal, Fudan University (Shanghai, China).

In Tregs, the maximal expression level was reached after 36 hrs of activation and remained at this moderate plateau for the duration of the experiment. Next, we further detected the expression of miR-126 on inducible Tregs (iTregs).

Given the critical role of Tregs in immune response, the investigation involved in regulation of induction and function sustainment of Tregs is valuable. However, up to now, few miRNAs were reported to regulate Tregs induction and suppressive function.

And this finding also was confirmed by the use of Akt inhibitor, combining these data suggested that miR-126 regulated the induction and function of Tregs through targeting p85&#x003b2; and subsequently altering PI3K-Akt pathway activity. Recently, one group reported that overexpression of miR-126 could cause T-cell hyperactivity through targeting to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. And, other group reported that in the absence of DNMT1, TCR signalling was sufficient for induction of Foxp3 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>]. Thus, it seemed that other potent target molecules of miR-126, which were not screened and investigated in this study, might have also contributed to the effect of miR-126 on the induction and function sustainment of Tregs, which still remains to be explored in successive study.</p><p>Silencing of specific miRNA, such as using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), has been developed to be an important strategy for uncovering miRNA biology and emerged as a ultimately novel means to the treatment of various disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>]. As such, silencing microRNA-155 could ameliorate the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>]. And silencing of miR-15 could protect against cardiac ischaemic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. Our previous study showed that depletion of Tregs could enhance the antitumour function of TILs in adoptive cell transfer assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>], which was consistent with others' reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>], suggesting that immunotherapy targeted to Tregs might be an a useful strategic alternative for ACT immunotherapy to enhance antitumour efficacy. Here, we further showed that silencing of miR-126 could significantly impair the suppressive effect of Tregs and finally endow effective antitumour effects of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. This finding suggested that miR-126 might be a novel potential target in Tregs-based therapeutic strategy for immunotherapy against tumour.</p><p>Altogether, our present study showed that miR-126 played an important role in the induction and function sustainment of Tregs through regulating PI3K/Akt pathway. We further demonstrated that silencing of miR-126 on Tregs could endow an effective antitumour effect of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data provided a novel insight on the functional role of miR-126 in Tregs and might help for the development of new therapeutic strategy based on Tregs for promoting T-cell immunity&#x02013;related disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by National Natural Science foundation of China (Grant no. 30901318, 81071744, 81260398), Specific Foundation
