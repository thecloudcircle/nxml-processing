This type of mortality is generally caused by the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant organisms, a consequence of evolution via natural selection. After the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) by wet chemistry, bio-functionalization with IgG molecules was performed. Following administration of IgG-GNPs to MRSA cultures at various concentrations and various incubation time laser irradiation was performed. To assess the selectivity and specificity of the proposed treatment the following methods were used: flow cytometry, contrast phase microscopy, and by fluorescence microscopy. The results in our study indicate that following administration of IgG-GNPs biomolecule an extended and selective bacterial death occurs following laser irradiation in a dose dependent manner. Therefore, the new findings might impel studies on these antibacterial nanomaterials and their biological and medical applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Drug-resistance crisis has become a global concern. High mortality rates associated with MRSA infections are the result of the increase in drug-resistance via natural selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The problem becomes even more serious in hospitalized patients who are at higher risk of bacterial infection. Drug-resistance has been shown to double the length of hospitalization, with a similar impact on mortality and morbidity, thus calling for extreme care when it comes to antimicrobial therapy in an attempt to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>The negative impact of &#x003b2;-lactam and penicillin-resistant MRSA isolates regards both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In recent years, Methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> has become one of the most common pathogens that cause nosocomial infections, being endemic in most countries in Europe. It is very difficult to eradicate this bacterium from hospitals due to its genetic variation. Mutations acquired by individual bacteria or horizontal gene transfer lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of antibiotics and thus resistant traits proliferate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Despite recent development of new antibiotics, most of them are only variations to already existing drugs that show low efficiency in MRSA infections. There is need for novel technologies that would help detect and treat MRSA infections quickly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>The importance of nanotechnology becomes relevant when it comes to drug delivery, which could be optimized by using targeted nanoparticles (NPs) as viable drug delivery systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Recent progress in chemical functionalization has seriously influenced the development of novel nanomaterials, as well as their use in biological and medical applications. The flexibility displayed by the physical and chemical properties of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and their strong absorption in the near-infrared region (NIR) make them suitable for a wide range of biomedical applications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Extensive studies on photothermal properties of GNPs conducted by various authors using transient absorption spectroscopy indicated the high absorption of gold nanostructures in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible range of detection, making them appropriate for applications in nanophotothermolysis experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Gold nanoparticles bound to various antibodies may exhibit target specificity for a key molecule from bacterial membrane. Once reach at the bacterial site these nanoparticles can be activated under NIR irradiation to transform photon energy into heat. This phenomenon would further lead to the disruption of bacterial membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>This therapeutic approach has been recently exploited by many research groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In this context we have performed synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) by wet chemistry followed by bio-functionalization with IgG molecules. Following administration of IgG-GNPs to MRSA cultures at various concentrations and various incubation time laser irradiation was performed. The presented results indicate that following IgG-GNPs biomolecule administration in MRSA culture an extended and selective bacterial death occurs following laser irradiation in a dose dependent manner.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functionalization and characterization of Gold Nanoparticles</title><p>Citrate capped, thioctic acid capped and IgG functionalized gold nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) were characterized by means of UV-Vis, FT-IR, DLS and AFM techniques.</p><p>The UV-Vis spectra for the GNP, GNP-TA and GNP-TA-IgG samples is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2III</xref>. The citrate capped gold nanoparticles present a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 521&#x02009;nm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the case of the GNP-TA sample, the SPR peak is centred at 523&#x02009;nm, this 2&#x02009;nm bathochromic shift is attributed to the successful place-exchange reaction between the initial capping agent, citrate, and the thioctic acid. After the functionalization of GNP-TA with IgG another, bathochromic shift of 13&#x02009;nm is registered in the UV-Vis spectra of the GNP-TA-IgG, this can be attributed to the bio-nanostructure increase in diameter due to the presence of the antibody on the gold nanoparticle surface.</p><p>To investigate the diameter size of the gold nanoparticles before and after functionalization with the IgG antibody DLS measurements were taken. The size distribution curves for the GNP and GNP-TA-IgG samples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2IV</xref>. 2, both samples presented themselves as monodisperse and stable at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The increase in size, after the functionalization step, suggested by the UV-Vis spectra is confirmed by the DLS analysis. The hydrodynamic diameter for GNP is 17&#x02009;nm while for the GNP-TA-IgG sample the registered diameter is 42&#x02009;nm.</p><p>In order to confirm the successful functionalization of the gold nanoparticles with the IgG antibody, the IR spectra for citrate capped GNPs, IgG and the GNP-TA-IgG bio-nanocomposite were recorded. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2I</xref> depicts the IR spectra in comparison for the 3 samples, in the region 2500-450&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The absorption peaks at 1591 and 1391&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> registered in the case of citrate capped GNPs are attributed to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching of COO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> of citrate ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>The IgG antibody presents two absorption bands located at 1635 and 1534&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> attributed to the amide I (C=O stretching) and, respectively, amide II (C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrational modes). These amides I and amide II bands are also present in the GNP-TA-IgG bio-nanostructure at 1640 and 1549&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Thus, for the GNP-TA-IgG sample, the disappearance of the citrate ions attributed IR bands, corroborated with the appearance of the IgG amide bands confirms the successful functionalization of gold nanoparticles with the antibody.</p><p>Atomic force microscopy measurements were conducted in order to investigate the size and shape of the synthetized GNP-TA-IgG bio-nanostructure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2II</xref>.

The IgG functionalized gold nanoparticles presented themselves as spherical in shape and with a mean diameter of 32&#x02009;nm. The DLS measurements placed the GNP-TA-IgG size at ~42&#x02009;nm, this can be explained by the fact that the DLS technique provides a mean hydrodynamic diameter of GNPs surrounded by the IgG antibody and the solvation layers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>The extent of MRSA destruction after treatment was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows that the expression of propidium iodide (red channel) was significantly higher in Ig-GNPs-treated bacteria, thus indicating higher rates of death in MRSA cultures than in bacteria treated with GNPs alone (Chi square, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, antibacterial activity against <italic>S. aureus</italic> was moderate to high for plasmon-activated GNPs, whose bacterial growth inhibition corresponded to 6.25% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the Ig-GNPs photothermal treatment.

They should also confirm drug efficacy. There is an urgent need for new site-targeted antibacterial agents, as antimicrobial resistance will still be an important issue in the following years. These alternative methods would eradicate bacteria and prove effective against all virulent strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Antibiotic resistance occurs in different ways: molecular and epitopic changes on the surface of the microorganism, chromosomal mutations, enzymatic deactivation, outer cellular antibiotic transportation, periplasm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Due to their unique tunable properties gold nanoparticles were intensively explored in late years as laser directed nanoheaters since absorb light several million times greater in comparison with biomolecules. As result of their thermal activation temperature due to electron-phonon relaxation mechanism temperature rise significantly in the medium surrounding the nanoparticle resulting in local heating at a micrometric scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. This phenomenon has been intensively explored by our group and others in the attempt to generate novel gold nanoparticle PT systems against multidrug resistant bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.

Delivery of functional moiety- attached gold nanoparticles associated with external laser irradiation could prove efficient in annihilation of MRSA biofilm and in preventing recurrence of infections. Moreover, maximal therapeutic benefit can be obtained while respecting a minimal level of invasiveness for the procedure (e.g. computer tomography/ultrasound- guided percutaneous or laparoscopic approach). We consequently dedicate our efforts to design a solution for the continuous need of novel targeting methods that would perform individual bacterial cell lysis associated with limited adverse effects.</p><p>Our previous reported data on safety of laser irradiation revealed no side effects <italic>in vitro</italic> when same parameters were used for laser exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.
