However, the biological functions and clinical significance of most circRNAs are still elusive. The purpose of this study was to explore the function and mechanism of a certain circRNA named circCDKN2B-AS1 in cervical cancer development and its potential value in the clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression level of circCDKN2B-AS1. CCK-8, Transwell, and flow cytometry (FCM) assays were performed to detect cellular proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, respectively. A Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer was used to measure glycolysis metabolism level. RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), actinomycin-D addition assays and Western blotting were used to screen and elucidate the potential mechanisms involved. BALB/c nude mice and zebrafish embryos (AB, WT) were used as animal models to investigate tumorigenesis capability. <sup>18</sup>FDG-microPET/CT imaging and lactic acid (LA) and pyruvic acid (PA) content detection assays were used to detect the level of glucose metabolism in subcutaneous tumors from nude mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">CircCDKN2B-AS1, a circular isoform of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CDKN2B-AS1, was upregulated in cervical cancer and precancerous tissues. We found that circCDKN2B-AS1 associated with the IMP3 protein depending on a specific binding site and regulated the stability of Hexokinase 2 (HK2) mRNA, the rate-limiting enzyme of the aerobic glycolysis pathway. The expression level of circCDKN2B-AS1 fated the binding of IMP3 to the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of HK2 mRNA, consequently affecting the malignant cell phenotype and aerobic glycolysis in cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo. Mutant circCDKN2B-AS1, lacking the IMP3 binding site, did not have such effects. Utilization of an inhibitory peptide to block the interaction between circCDKN2B-AS1 and the IMP3 protein impeded the binding of IMP3 to the 3&#x02019;UTR of HK2 mRNA and suppressed aerobic glycolysis in cervical cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our findings demonstrate that circCDKN2B-AS1 facilitates aerobic glycolysis by sponging the IMP3 protein to stabilize HK2 mRNA, consequently promoting the malignant phenotype in cervical cancer, which may provide a potential approach for cervical cancer therapeutics.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CircRNA</kwd><kwd>CircCDKN2B-AS1</kwd><kwd>Cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>Aerobic glycolysis</kwd><kwd>IMP3</kwd><kwd>HK2</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 2016YFC1302900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Weiguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Key research and development plan in Zhejiang province</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 2020C03025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xinyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities </institution></funding-source><award-id>2019QNA7035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Junfen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017XZZX001-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NSF of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>81702552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Junfen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Medical and Health science and Technology project of Zhejiang Province </institution></funding-source><award-id>2017KY099</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Junfen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017M621954</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution> the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province </institution></funding-source><award-id>No. LQ20H160049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Shizhou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82072855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Junfen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par39">Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally, leading to an estimated 530,000 new cases and 270,000 deaths each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Our results showed that the inhibitory peptide IIP blocked the interaction between circCDKN2B-AS1 and IMP3, weakened the binding of IMP3 to the 3&#x02019;UTR of HK2 mRNA, decreased the expression of HK2 and suppressed aerobic glycolysis.</p><p id="Par89">There were some limitations of our study. For instance, it needs to be determined whether some of the potential circCDKN2B-AS1 binding proteins, such as IMP2, are involved in the gene regulatory network that promotes aerobic glycolysis in cervical cancer cells. In addition, the role of circCDKN2B-AS1 in other tumors and other diseases also needs to be investigated in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par90">In the study, we found, for the first time to our knowledge, that circCDKN2B-AS1 acted as a promoter that facilitated aerobic glycolysis by sponging IMP3 protein to stabilize HK2 mRNA, consequently promoted malignant phenotypes in cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo, and the synthesizing inhibitory peptide IIP could effectively block the interaction between circCDKN2B-AS1 and IMP3 protein. Our findings may provide a new approach for cervical cancer therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec36"><p>
