The results indicated that DOM in pore water of Yangtze estuary was very variable which mainly composed of low aromaticity and molecular weight materials. Three humic-like substances (C1, C2, C4) and one protein-like substance (C3) were identified by PARAFAC model. C1, C2 and C4 exhibited same trends and were very similar. The separation of samples on both axes of the PCA showed the difference in DOM properties. C1, C2 and C4 concurrently showed higher positive factor 1 loadings, while C3 showed highly positive factor 2 loadings. The PCA analysis showed a combination contribution of microbial DOM signal and terrestrial DOM signal in the Yangtze estuary. Higher and more variable DOM abundance, aromaticity and molecular weight of surface sediment pore water DOM can be found in the southern nearshore than the other regions primarily due to the influence of frequent and intensive human activities and tributaries inflow in this area. The DOM abundance, aromaticity, molecular weight and fluorescence intensity in core of different depth were relative constant and increased gradually with depth. DOM in core was mainly composed of humic-like material, which was due to higher release of the sedimentary organic material into the porewater during early diagenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Project, Grant No. 2010CB429003) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21177013).

When the environmental conditions change, adsorbed matters on the sediments could be desorbed into pore water and then diffuse into overlying water, which would lead to the change of aquatic environment <xref rid="pone.0076633-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. So pore water as a medium connecting sediments and overlying water is important for the identification of biogeochemical processes in aquatic systems.</p><p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important component in the natural aquatic systems <xref rid="pone.0076633-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, especially in marine and coastal environments. Substantial terrestrial DOM inputs through river discharges are estimated to contribute 0.25&#x000d7;10<sup>15</sup> g carbon (C) yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to the ocean carbon pool <xref rid="pone.0076633-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Together with the terrestrial DOM, rivers convey nutrients, which can result in intense primary productivity, leading to the production of autochthonous DOM <xref rid="pone.0076633-Yamashita1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. As an important marine system, estuarine ecosystem has always been hot spot of DOM cycling because its DOM composition is controlled by the relative abundance of many different DOM sources, allowing the transfer of organic or inorganic substances from the continental to the oceanic environment. So DOM in the estuary has significant effect in substance cycling because of its high primary productions as well as the complex interactions of physical, photochemical and microbial processes.</p><p>As one of the world&#x02019;s largest estuaries, the Yangtze estuary situated in east China, containing a dense population of 13 million and concentrated industry <xref rid="pone.0076633-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The Yangtze estuary is the super subtropical muddy estuary with high spatial heterogeneity and complex DOM sources <xref rid="pone.0076633-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It was reported that the Yangtze River carries fine sediments 480 Mt yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to the sea <xref rid="pone.0076633-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Wherein, over half of these materials are deposited in the Yangtze estuary. In recent years, flow rate and river sediment discharge downstream the Yangtze River has dramatically decreased because of the construction of dams and large waterway projects in the Yangtze River <xref rid="pone.0076633-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, resulting in the changes of material cycle processes in the estuary. So the study on the chemical characteristics and variations of DOM in the Yangtze estuary has extensive implications in aquatic ecology.</p><p>There has been a great quantity of researches in the distribution and characterization of DOM in pore water from estuarine and coastal systems over the past decades <xref rid="pone.0076633-Lepane1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076633-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076633-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0076633-Burdige1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To date, only few studies have, to the best of our knowledge, been carried out on the characterization of pore water DOM comprehensively in the Yangtze estuary. In their studies, only traditional DOM coefficients and &#x02018;peak picking&#x02019; technique of EEMs were used, and thus DOM variations couldn&#x02019;t be clearly indentified <xref rid="pone.0076633-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076633-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Nowadays, the environmental dynamics (i.e., source and fate) of DOM components in aquatic ecosystems have been evaluated by using an advanced approach, the combined techniques of excitation&#x02013;emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) <xref rid="pone.0076633-Yamashita1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076633-Stedmon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The EEM-PARAFAC can be a powerful method for detecting small but potentially significant variations in DOM composition quickly and conveniently. It was considered an ideal technique for understanding DOM dynamics in water systems <xref rid="pone.0076633-Jaff1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076633-Yamashita2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, our present study concerns quantitative and qualitative characterization of pore water DOM in the Yangtze estuary of China by using EEM-PARAFAC methods. The objective of this study was to (1) characterize the vertical and horizontal spatial distributions of the components and abundance of sediment pore water DOM, to realize its biogeochemical nature and properties. (2) explore the origin of pore water DOM, further to understand the contributions of internal release or anthropogenic activities to the fluorescent organic matter in sediment interfaces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Area and Sample Collection</title><p>The Yangtze estuary is the largest estuary in China <xref rid="pone.0076633-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.
