<italic>&#x0201c;This Centre is forging global partnerships to relieve the human suffering from cancer.&#x0201d;</italic>
</p><p>The words of former US Senator George Mitchell, captured on a giant 10&#x02010;meter high banner, greet every visitor to the Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB) at Queen's University Belfast (QUB) in Northern Ireland (NI), reflecting the aspiration to match local ambition with global collaboration to achieve better outcomes for patients with cancer. The opening of the CCRCB by Senator Mitchell represented an important step in a capacity&#x02010;building initiative that commenced in the mid&#x02010;1990s to address the fragmented and uncoordinated nature of cancer care and research in NI.</p></sec><sec id="cncr29814-sec-0002"><title>THE CHALLENGE: FRAGMENTED CANCER SERVICES AND POOR CANCER OUTCOMES</title><p>The publication of the Campbell Report in 1996<sup>1</sup> highlighted significant deficiencies in cancer services in NI. For example, among patients with breast cancer, there was wide variation in treatment provision across the province. Although some patients received quality care from specialist breast cancer teams, audit data indicated that 64% of surgeons in NI had performed &#x0003c;10 breast cancer surgeries per year.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Similar issues were identified for several other malignancies, such that NI had the poorest cancer outcomes in the United Kingdom for the majority of cancers.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> However, as well as highlighting the problems that an uncoordinated cancer care system with a limited and underresourced cancer research activity can pose, the Campbell Report<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> also provided a blueprint for change, recommending the development and implementation of a population&#x02010;level cancer plan that emphasized the need for a comprehensive and coordinated research&#x02010;enabled partnership approach to achieve improved outcomes for patients with cancer. Key principles of this strategy included: 1) the consolidation and expansion of cancer services within an overarching cancer center framework; 2) the production of comprehensive incidence and mortality data through a research&#x02010;active national cancer registry; 3) the introduction of robust cancer screening services; and 4) the development of an expanded research capacity to enable discovery science to be translated into clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="cncr29814-sec-0003"><title>RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGE: EXEMPLARS OF AN INTEGRATED PARTNERSHIP&#x02010;ENABLED APPROACH TO IMPROVING CANCER CARE AND RESEARCH</title><p>The question remains: were the ambitions of the Campbell Report rewarded with measurable outputs of success? In the clinical setting, the introduction of a province&#x02010;wide 2&#x02010;view mammography screening program (unlike the single&#x02010;view approach that was used initially in the rest of the United Kingdom) raised attendance levels at breast screening clinics from just under 30% to nearly 80% and resulted in better detection of small invasive cancers. Breast cancer services were reorganized to ensure patients were seen by specialist teams with dedicated breast cancer surgeons rather than general surgeons with low&#x02010;volume activity as had been the case previously. Enhanced screening, in combination with this consolidation of breast cancer services, yielded a decrease in breast cancer mortality of 29.6% by 2006.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Continuing this upward trend, by 2013, survival in NI for breast cancer was the highest in the United Kingdom (81.9%) compared with England (79.3%), Scotland (78.5%), and Wales (78.2%).<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>
</p><p>From a public health perspective, the ability to capture NI population&#x02010;level data through the precise development and interrogation of comprehensive population&#x02010;based cohorts, particularly in patients with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, has yielded findings that not only increased our understanding of disease etiology but also delivered population&#x02010;relevant, practice&#x02010;changing clinical interventions. The NI Barrett Esophagus Register<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> is to our knowledge one of the largest population&#x02010;based registries of Barrett esophagus (BE) in the world (&#x0003e;13,000), and includes every patient in NI diagnosed between 1993 and 2010. The precise evaluation of this unrivalled resource has revealed that progression from BE to esophageal cancer is lower than was previously suspected,<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> thus questioning the cost&#x02010;effectiveness of a BE surveillance program. Research on the NI BE cohort has also revealed that smoking leads to a 2&#x02010;fold increase in the risk of esophageal cancer,<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> emphasizing the need for smoking cessation strategies for patients with BE. The availability of population&#x02010;based cohorts for colorectal adenoma/colorectal cancer (CRC) has also contributed to research with potentially practice&#x02010;changing clinical implications.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Pharmacoepidemiological studies of general practitioner databases have shown that bisphosphonates (which are increasingly used to treat osteoporosis but are potentially associated with a higher risk of esophagitis) do not lead to an increased risk of esophageal cancer,<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> thus supporting their continued use for the treatment of a common complication, particularly in postmenopausal women. Similar investigations of the use of statins after diagnosis have indicated that these drugs may increase overall survival in patients with CRC.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>
</p><p>From the perspective of translational research, biomarker and drug discovery research has underpinned the development of new prognostic/predictive tests and the identification of novel agents with therapeutic potential. For example, in CRC, gene expression profiling in &#x0003e;500 patients with AJCC TNM stage II disease (using proprietary CRC disease&#x02010;specific array technology developed in collaboration with Almac Diagnostics [Craigavon, UK]) has led to the identification of a 634&#x02010;gene signature (ColDx). Initial validation of this signature in primary tumors from 215 patients with AJCC TNM stage II disease from 12 centers as part of an international clinical trial yielded positive results that outperformed conventional clinicopathological risk factors (hazard ratio of 2.53 [95% confidence interval,1.54&#x02010;4.15] [<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.0003] for 5&#x02010;year recurrence&#x02010;free survival and 2.21 [<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.008] for cancer&#x02010;related death).<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> This research has resulted in the development, commercialization, and licensing of a molecular test (GeneFx Colon; Helomics, Pittsburgh, Pa) with significant prognostic potential.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>
</p><p>These exemplars highlight the relevance of a cross&#x02010;sectoral, patient&#x02010;focused partnership (involving clinicians, allied health care professionals, pathologists, patient advocates, basic and translational scientists, bioinformaticians, biostatisticians, and the biotech/biopharma industry) to improve patient outcomes. The success of this partnership was recognized in 2012, when Queen Elizabeth II presented her Queen's Diamond Jubilee Award to the Vice Chancellor and the Dean of Medicine of QUB, thus valorizing the impact of the university&#x02010;led comprehensive cancer program on patient care.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="cncr29814-sec-0004"><title>COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CARE IN NI: PARTNERSHIP AND INTEGRATION</title><p>The development of an integrated cancer plan, aggregating services and expertise around a single comprehensive cancer center,<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> and the implementation of a collaborative translational research strategy that values innovation and cross&#x02010;sectoral partnership have, as outlined above, underpinned a significant change in the last 20 years. The cross&#x02010;sectoral embrace of the program is key to its ongoing activities, connecting patient research advocacy, academic endeavor, industry rigor, and clinical excellence in an added&#x02010;value partnership (underpinned by support from government agencies, industry and academic leaders, National Health Service Hospital Trusts, research councils, and charities) that drives a translational continuum from discovery science to clinical application. Herein, we detail the collaborative activities of the key stakeholders that catalyzed and delivered a truly transformative change for patients with cancer in NI.</p><sec id="cncr29814-sec-0005"><title>Cancer at the Population Level: The Northern Ireland Cancer Registry</title><p>Having a functional, research&#x02010;enabled cancer registry that captures population&#x02010;level data has played a key role in the development of the comprehensive cancer program in NI. The Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centers/nicr/">www.qub.ac.uk/research-centers/nicr/</ext-link>) was founded in 1994 and demonstrates the value of an intersectoral partnership located within the Centre for Public Health at QUB, but funded through NI's Public Health Agency, a government body. Capturing cancer incidence, prevalence, and survival data at an entire population level is a vital resource, underpinning not only cancer research efforts but also service planning and cancer policy initiatives. Unlike many other European registries in which data coverage can be suboptimal (varying from 17%&#x02010;100%, with a European average of 50%),<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> data coverage in the NICR is extremely high, with a registry completeness of 100%.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> In 1995, the NICR established what to our knowledge is the first entirely electronic total population&#x02010;based cancer registry in the world. The NICR embraces the outreach ethos that Senator Mitchell highlighted, contributing significantly to European and international initiatives including EUROCARE (a collaborative research project on cancer survivorship in Europe), the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP), and RARECARENet (an information network on rare cancers in Europe).<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> An added&#x02010;value aspect of the NICR is its ability to collect data across the entire cancer journey because health and social care in NI are linked at a service delivery level, thus increasing the potential impact for both patients with cancer and cancer survivors. The NICR is increasingly patient&#x02010;focused and has recently commenced a &#x000a3;2.1&#x02010;million ($3.23&#x02010;million) Movember&#x02010;funded program to evaluate patient&#x02010;reported outcomes in individuals with prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec id="cncr29814-sec-0006"><title>Molecular Pathology: The Foundation of Innovation</title><p>The establishment of the Northern Ireland Molecular Pathology Laboratory<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> and the Northern Ireland Biobank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nibiobank.org">www.nibiobank.org</ext-link>) have been key infrastructural components of the translational research approach, providing a tripartite linkage between QUB, the hospital trusts, and the bioindustry sector. Collecting high&#x02010;quality, clinically annotated biospecimens, both for specific targeted cohorts and on a population basis through the Northern Ireland Biobank, has provided additional impetus to the translational research effort, delivering a rich resource with which to maximize the clinical impact of discovery science in molecular diagnostics, molecular therapeutics, and molecular cancer epidemiology.</p><p>Molecular pathology is a key enabler of the precision cancer medicine revolution, accelerating the introduction of new therapies through the discovery, validation, and clinical application of biomarkers for patient stratification and the evaluation of disease response. We have developed a hybrid molecular pathology model, moving away from the traditional division between diagnostics and translational research. In this model,<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> we apply the same analytical, quality&#x02010;control, and organizational rigor to research discovery and its translation as we do to pathology test validation and its clinical application.

To realize the value of the comprehensive &#x0201c;omic&#x0201d; interrogation of cancer biospecimens, we developed a novel translational platform, PICan (Pathology Integromics in Cancer) (Fig. <xref rid="cncr29814-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>),<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> that integrates all laboratory data (traditional, molecular, and digital pathology) with relevant clinical information, thus maximizing our ability to discover new biomarkers/therapeutic targets. PICan's integromics framework was tested and valorized in a study of a 288 tissue microarray cores from a cohort of patients with breast cancer, incorporating image&#x02010;related information including p53 immunohistochemistry and tissue pathology, mutational analysis, next&#x02010;generation sequencing, and unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiling, in combination with clinical data to comprehensively probe the involvement of p53 in breast cancer.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> PICan's browser&#x02010;based approach allows for data analysis and interpretation and digital image assessment to be achieved seamlessly, facilitating the incorporation of multiple high&#x02010;dimensional data into a single searchable interface.

The NCI&#x02010;Ireland&#x02010;Northern Ireland Memorandum of Understanding underpinned the development of appropriate infrastructure in cancer epidemiology, cancer care, and cancer research and education on the island of Ireland<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> and its outputs and legacy are the subject of a separate publication (unpublished data). From the perspective of clinical cancer research and cancer treatment, one of the first key outcomes from this agreement was the establishment of a robust cancer clinical trials infrastructure through the creation of the Northern Ireland Cancer Clinical Trials Unit (now known as the Northern Ireland Cancer Trials Centre). Since its establishment in early 2000, the Northern Ireland Cancer Trials Centre has significantly enhanced participation in cancer clinical trials in Northern Ireland, such that in the period between April 2013 and March 2014, a total of 1665 patients in Northern Ireland were recruited to cancer clinical trials and related translational studies, a rate that is nearly twice the recruitment target of 850 patients (10% of the incident cancers in NI).<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>
</p><p>This enhanced cancer clinical trial activity, underpinned by patient&#x02010;focused discovery research and its translation, led to the subsequent designation of the CCRCB as a CRUK center (one of the first to be established in the United Kingdom) in 2009 and a Department of Health/CRUK Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC) in 2007. Focused on driving early&#x02010;phase clinical trials, the ECMC provides the perfect conduit for translating discovery science conducted within the research program into new treatments for patients with cancer.</p><p>A key exemplar of this approach has resulted from a discovery joint research program between QUB, Almac Discovery, and Almac Diagnostics. Discovery research revealed that the endogenous protein FKBPL (FK506 binding&#x02010;like) has significant antiangiogenic properties and is mediated through a CD44&#x02010;dependent mechanism.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> In collaboration with Almac Discovery, a 23&#x02010;amino acid linear peptide that represents the active domain of FKBPL has been developed (ALM201). QUB is now leading a national first&#x02010;in&#x02010;human phase 1 clinical trial of this novel antiangiogenic peptide, ALM201,<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> for the treatment of platinum&#x02010;resistant ovarian cancer (EudraCT number: 2014&#x02010;001175&#x02010;31).

For example, discovery DNA microarray analysis of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA DNA damage response (DDR) pathway identified a 44&#x02010;gene expression&#x02010;based DDR deficiency signature.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Evaluation of this 44&#x02010;gene signature in 3 independent data sets from 203 patients with breast cancer highlighted the ability of this biology to predict response to DNA&#x02010;damaging chemotherapy, leading to the development of a formalin&#x02010;fixed paraffin&#x02010;embedded tissue assay that was validated as a predictor of response in the neoadjuvant setting and recurrence&#x02010;free survival in the adjuvant setting after anthracycline/cyclophosphamide&#x02010;based therapy.<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>
</p><p>CCRCB researchers, in collaboration with Almac Diagnostics, also have identified the potential for this biomarker to be relevant in patients with CRC, and this work has led to the CCRCB becoming a significant partner in a &#x000a3;5&#x02010;million (approximately $7.8 million) University of Oxford&#x02010;led Medical Research Council&#x02010;CRUK stratified medicine program in CRC (S&#x02010;CORT [Stratification in COloRecTal cancer]),<xref rid="cncr29814-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> which brings together all the major UK centers in CRC research in a national collaborative partnership with bioindustry and patient advocacy groups.
