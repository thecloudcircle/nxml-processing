Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) neurodegeneration is shown to be associated with aging and neuroinflammation. However, it remains unclear about the relationship among Smad3 signaling, aging, neuroinflammation, and PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Rats were treated with SIS3 (a specific inhibitor of Smad3, intranigal injection) and/or lipopolysaccharide (intraperitoneal injection). We investigated the effect of SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide and their mechanism of action on motor behavior and nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in the rats. Furthermore, we explored the effect of SIS3 and LPS and their potential signaling mechanism of action on inflammatory response by using primary microglial cultures. Finally, we investigated the relationship among aging, Smad3 signaling, and neuroinflammation using animals of different ages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Both SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide induced significant behavior deficits and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the rats compared with the vehicle-treated (control) rats. Significantly increased behavior deficits and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration were observed in the rats co-treated with SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide compared with the rats treated with vehicle, SIS3, or lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, both SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide induced significant microglia activation and proinflammatory factor (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, iNOS, and ROS) level increase in the SN of rats compared with the control rats. Significantly enhanced microglial inflammatory response was observed in the rats co-treated with SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide compared with the other three groups. For our in vitro study, both SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide induced significant proinflammatory factor level increase in primary microglia cultures compared with the control cultures. Significantly increased inflammatory response was observed in the cultures co-treated with SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide compared with the other three groups. MAPK (ERK/p38) contributed to microglial inflammatory response induced by co-treatment with SIS3 and lipopolysaccharide. Interestingly, there was decrease in Smad3 and pSmad3 expression (protein) and enhancement of neuroinflammation in the mouse SN with aging. Proinflammatory factor levels were significantly inversely correlated with Smad3 and pSmad3 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Our study strongly indicates the involvement of SN Smad3 signaling deficiency in aging and PD neurodegeneration and provides a novel molecular mechanism underlying the participation of aging in PD and helps to elucidate the mechanisms for the combined effect of multiple factors in PD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Smad3 signaling</kwd><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>Neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81671273</award-id><award-id>81171204</award-id><award-id>30772280</award-id><award-id>81400925</award-id><award-id>81471148</award-id><award-id>81771211</award-id><award-id>81703852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003395</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14YZ046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission</institution></funding-source><award-id>20134049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004921</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YG2013MS22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Eastern Tech-transfer Center</institution></funding-source><award-id>201713972877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology</institution></funding-source><award-id>17401901000</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC1310300</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>SHSMU-ION Research Center for Brain Disorders</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015NKX007</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD), a common aging-related neurodegenerative disorder, is clinically characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. The pathological features of PD are progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and loss of dopamine terminals in the striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Aging is a primary risk factor for the etiopathogenesis of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalence in PD rises with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To date, the etiopathogenesis of PD has not been fully elucidated. There are increasing evidences indicating that the etiology and pathogenesis of PD are multifactorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Neuroinflammation is widely believed to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Microglia, the macrophage-like resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are shown to play a crucial role in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration by releasing proinflammatory factors such as interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Microglia-derived proinflammatory factors are demonstrated to induce dopaminergic neuronal loss and further induce inflammatory cells to gather to the disease lesions, aggravating PD dopaminergic neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Smad3 is a main effector in the canonical signaling of transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Canonical TGF-&#x003b2;1 signal transduction pathway is comprised of ligand binding to the type II receptor (T&#x003b2;R-II) and subsequently phosphorylating the type I receptor (T&#x003b2;R-I). Upon phosphorylation, the receptor complex leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which form a heteromeric complex with Smad4 and translocate into nucleus to regulate the expression of targeted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Smad3 signaling has been shown to be required for the development and homeostasis of microglia and plays a key role in the regulation of microglial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Accumulating studies have indicated that Smad3 pathway participates in the anti-inflammatory property of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the brain by inhibiting microglia activation and proinflammatory/immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, it remains unclear about the relationship among Smad3 signaling, aging, neuroinflammation, and PD.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, rats were treated with SIS3 (intranigal injection, 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/each side), a specific inhibitor of Smad3, and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, intraperitoneal injection, 1&#x02009;mg/kg). We investigated the effect of SIS3 and LPS and their mechanism of action on motor behavior and nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in the rats. Furthermore, we explored the effect of SIS3 and LPS and their potential signaling mechanism of action on inflammatory response by using primary microglial cell cultures.

Rats were randomly divided into various experimental groups (vehicle group: <italic>N</italic> = 14, SIS3 group: <italic>N</italic> = 15, LPS group: <italic>N</italic> = 14, SIS3 + LPS group: <italic>N</italic> = 17). The rats received SIS3 or DMSO via a stereotaxic injection as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]: SIS3 (4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of DMSO) was stereotaxically injected into the SN on the right side of rats (5.5&#x02009;mm posterior, 1.5&#x02009;mm lateral, and 8.3&#x02009;mm ventral to the bregma) over a period of 5&#x02009;min. The injection needle was left in situ for another 5&#x02009;min to avoid backflow. Similarly, rats were stereotaxically treated with SIS3 (4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l) on the other side of SN. Each rat received a total of 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/10&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of SIS3 administration. The vehicle-treated (control) rats were stereotaxically injected with equivalent volume (5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l/each side) of DMSO. On the next day, the rats were treated with LPS or vehicle. For LPS administration, LPS was dissolved in saline at a concentration of 0.25&#x02009;mg/ml. Based on the body weight of rats (250&#x02013;300&#x02009;g), 1.0&#x02013;1.2&#x02009;ml of LPS (1&#x02009;mg/kg body weight) or equivalent volume of vehicle (saline) was administrated via single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. These rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on the 21st day after the last drug administration for subsequent experiments. Usually, aging animals are difficult to obtain for researches. Luckily, aging mice could be available at the time that we needed aging animals.

The results were analyzed from the average. Five sections per rat were used to quantify the cell number. In the striatum, TH<sup>+</sup> innervations were analyzed by optical density of TH-staining slices and measured by using the ImageJ software (NIH) under a microscope with &#x000d7; 20 magnification. Five sections per rat were used to quantify the optical density of TH<sup>+</sup> innervations.

To investigate the effect of SIS3 and LPS on rat behavior, behavioral tests including open field, beam walk, and catalepsy tests were performed on rats on the 7th, 14th, and 21st day after the last drug administration.

Smad3 signaling is indicated to regulate microglia activity. PD neurodegeneration is shown to be associated with aging and neuroinflammation. However, it remains unclear about the relationship among Smad3 signaling, aging, neuroinflammation, and PD.</p><p id="Par36">SIS3 has been demonstrated to reduce TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and interaction of Smad3 with Smad4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As a specific inhibitor of Smad3, SIS3 is widely used to investigate the role of Smad3 signaling in many diseases. In this study, rats were stereotaxically administrated with SIS3 (4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/each side) and/or intraperitoneally injected with LPS (1&#x02009;mg/kg). LPS has been shown to enter CNS through the blood-brain barrier to induce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and reproduce the pathological features of human PD in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We observed that not only LPS but also SIS3 induced significant behavior deficits and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the rats compared with the control rats. Moreover, SIS3 exacerbated LPS-induced behavior deficits and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the rats. These results reveal that Smad3 signaling deficiency may participate in PD neurodegeneration. In addition, in this study, behavioral tests were performed three rounds on rats on the 7th, 14th, and 21st day after the last drug administration. Rats treated with SIS3 or LPS alone or simultaneously presented progressively severe behavior deficits over time, suggesting that SIS3 or LPS alone or in combination induced disease progression in a time-dependent manner.</p><p id="Par37">It has been widely accepted that microglia activation and inflammatory/immune response can damage neurons and are responsible for neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. As the main immune cells of CNS, microglia are the first line of defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Under resting conditions, microglia have essential functions of surveying environment, providing neuronal support, and promoting phagocytosis and clearance of cell debris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, over-activated microglia change the morphology of small cell bodies with ramified processes into enlarged cell bodies and shorten cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Moreover, following activation, microglia change their functions and produce proinflammatory factors including inflammatory cytokines and reactive species, which contribute to neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In this study, we showed that both SIS3 and LPS significantly induced microglia activation reflected by microglia number increase and morphological changes, as well as enhanced levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, iNOS, and ROS in the SN of rats. We also observed that SIS3 was capable of significantly aggravating LPS-induced microglia activation and proinflammatory factor level increase in the SN of rats. Smad3 has been indicated to play an important role in regulation of immune response. Previous studies have shown that Smad3 deficiency promotes proinflammatory factor production in mast cells and macrophages treated with LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Impaired mucosal immune function was observed in mutant mice due to Smad3 disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In addition, Smad3 pathway participates in the induction of quiescent microglial phenotype by TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;1-Smad3 signaling modifies A&#x003b2; clearance through modulating microglial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits microglial inflammatory response and exerts neuroprotective effect in a MPP<sup>+</sup> rat model of PD via Smad3 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, our results strongly indicate that Smad3 signaling deficiency-mediated microglial inflammatory response may be involved in PD dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, in our study, SIS3 did not significantly induce astrocyte activation in the SN of rats with or without LPS administration. This result is not consistent with the previous study showing decreased number of astrocytes in the SN of Smad3 null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In fact, Wang and his colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] have shown that Smad3 is necessary for the TGF-&#x003b2;1-mediated p15<sup>INK4B</sup> induction and astrocyte growth inhibition by using astrocyte cultures derived from Smad3 null mice. In response to neuronal insults, the number of astrocytes may not be decreased but probably increase to a certain extent in Smad3 deficiency. Furthermore, SIS3 (a specific inhibitor of Smad3) was used in our study, which is different from the genetic method of Smad3 knock-out in other researches. The above result difference between our and the previous study may be attributed to different experimental conditions. It has been widely accepted that astrocytes have the capacity of trophic support to neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Although astrocytes can regulate the immune reactivity in response to various stimuli, microglia have been suggested to display much more cytotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons than astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. On the one hand, there is different distribution of microglia throughout the brain regions with the highest microglial concentration in the SN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. On the other hand, over-activated microglia release a large number of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF&#x003b1; and oxidation products such as NO and ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Enhanced inflammatory cytokines further induce ROS production and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In turn, increased oxidative stress reaction enhances proinflammatory factor production and amplifies inflammatory response, which results in a vicious circle of neuroinflammation and oxidative insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Dopaminergic neurons in the SN are particularly sensitive to oxidative damage due to their reduced antioxidant capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Therefore, the enrichment of microglia in the SN combined with the intrinsic characteristics of dopaminergic neurons may be responsible for selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration mediated by microglial inflammatory response.</p><p id="Par38">In the present study, we further investigated potential signaling mechanism underlying Smad3 signaling deficiency-mediated microglial inflammatory response through primary microglia cultures. We observed that LPS significantly increased proinflammatory factor levels in primary microglia cultures compared with the control cultures. Furthermore, SIS3 not only significantly enhanced the levels of proinflammatory factors but also significantly aggravated the LPS-induced proinflammatory factor level increase in microglia cultures, which are consistent with our in vivo results and further support the role of Smad3 signaling deficiency in PD neurodegeneration. MAPK pathways have been known to be involved in the induction of microglial proinflammatory factor production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In agreement with the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], our results showed that LPS significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and JNK in the microglial cultures compared with the control cultures. SIS3 significantly induced the phosphorylation of ERK and p38, but not JNK, in the cultures. Also, SIS3 significantly enhanced the LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK and p38, but not JNK, in the cultures. We further used the inhibitors of ERK (PD98059), p38 (SB203580), and JNK (SP600125) to determine whether MAPK activation is responsible for inflammatory response enhancement in microglia co-treated with SIS3 and LPS. We observed that SIS3-enhanced proinflammatory factor levels in LPS-treated microglia were significantly inhibited by ERK and p38 inhibitors, but not by JNK inhibitor. Therefore, our results indicate that ERK/p38 MAPK may be a contributor to Smad3 signaling deficiency-mediated microglial inflammatory response. Of course, we could not rule out the possibility of the involvement of other pathways including JNK MAPK. Consistent with our study, ERK and p38 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines, iNOS, and COX-2 induced by thrombin in cortical microglia cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Other studies showed that suppression of JNK and ERK reduced LPS-mediated microglia activation in BV cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and that inhibition of p38 signaling rescued dopaminergic neuron degeneration by inhibiting microglia polarization in a mouse model of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. All the above differences regarding the role of MAPK pathways in microglial regulation may be attributed to different experimental conditions.</p><p id="Par39">As expected, in the present study, SIS3 significantly reduced pSmad3 expression, but not Smad3 expression in the rat SN and microglia cultures, which is consistent with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed that LPS significantly increased pSmad3 protein level in the rat SN and microglia cultures, although there was no significant change in the level of Smad3 protein. Moreover, in the study, LPS significantly increased TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression in the rat SN and microglia cultures with or without SIS3 administration compared with the control group. As an anti-inflammatory regulator, TGF-&#x003b2;1, and thus TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smad3 signaling is predominantly upregulated under pathological inflammatory conditions to modulate and attenuate inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. LPS, widely used as a proinflammatory stimuli, has been reported to increase the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 and its downstream signaling protein pSmad3 in primary microglia or hippocampus of young mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], which is in agreement with our results.</p><p id="Par40">Aging is a major risk factor for PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, it is still unknown about the relationship among aging, Smad3 signaling, and neuroinflammation in the SN. In the present study, we observed that the levels of proinflammatory factors were increased in the SN of mice with aging by comparing mice of different ages. Interestingly, the expression of SN Smad3 and pSmad3 was decreased in normal aging. Proinflammatory factor levels were significantly inversely correlated with Smad3 and pSmad3 expression in the SN. These results indicate that SN Smad3 signaling deficiency may participate in the induction of aging-related neuroinflammation and ultimately promote the development and progression of PD. In addition, there was no significant difference in Smad3 and pSmad3 protein expression in the cerebellum between young and aged mice, suggesting a selective distribution of aging-related Smad3 signaling deficiency. Based on the regional selectivity of neuronal loss in PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], the above results further support the notion that Smad3 signaling deficiency may participate in PD dopaminergic neurodegeneration. From another point of view, our results provide a novel molecular mechanism underlying the participation of aging in PD. In aged brain, there is an elevated neuroinflammation characterized by senescent and over-responsive microglia and cumulative proinflammatory factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Aging-related Smad3 signaling deficiency, at least partially, is a significant cause for the dysfunction of aged microglia in the SN. Therefore, aging-related Smad3 signaling impairment may contribute, at least partially, to the etiopathogenesis of PD. In addition to the property of inducing microglia activation, Smad3 signaling deficiency has been implicated to promote dopamine catabolism and &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregation in Smad3 null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Further studies are needed to investigate precise mechanisms for the role of Smad3 signaling deficiency in aging and PD neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">Our results show that SN Smad3 signaling deficiency may induce microglial inflammatory response mediated by ERK/p38 MAPK activation and ultimately result in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration.
