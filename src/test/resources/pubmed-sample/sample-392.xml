The disappearance of wetland ecosystems due to coastal development prevents birds from completing their migrations, resulting in population declines, and even an eventual collapse of the migration phenomenon. Coastal wetlands are also under threat from global climate change and its consequences, notably sea level rise (SLR), extreme storm events, and accompanying wave and tidal surges. The impacts of SLR are compounded by coastal subsidence and decreasing sedimentation, which can result from coastal development. Thus, important wetlands along the flyway should be assessed for the impacts of climate change and coastal subsidence to plan and implement proactive climate adaptation strategies that include habitat migration and possibility of coastal squeeze. We modelled the impacts of climate change and decreasing sedimentation rates on important bird habitats in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site to support a climate adaptation strategy that will continue to host migratory birds. Located in the Inner Deep Bay of the Pearl River estuary, Mai Po&#x02019;s tidal flats, coastal mangroves, marshes, and fishponds provide habitat for over 80,000 wintering and passage waterbirds. We applied the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to simulate habitat conversion under two SLR scenarios (1.5m and 2.0m) for 2050, 2075, and 2100 for four accretion rates (2mm/yr, 4 mm/yr, 8 mm/yr, 15 mm/yr). The results showed no discernible impact to habitats until after 2075, but projections for 2100 show that the mangroves, marshes and tidal flats could be impacted in almost all scenarios of SLR and accretion. Under a 1.5m SLR scenario, even at low tide, if accretion levels decrease to 4 mm/yr, the tidal flats will be inundated and with a 2 mm/yr accretion the mangroves will also be inundated. Thus, important shorebird habitats will be lost. During high tide the ponds inside the nature reserve, which are intensively managed to provide high tide roosting sites and other habitats for waterbirds, will also be inundated. Thus, with a 1.5m SLR and declining sedimentation the migratory shorebirds will lose habitat, including the high tide roosting habitats inside the nature reserve. The model also indicates that the fishponds further inland in the Ramsar site will be less impacted. Most fishponds are privately owned and could be developed in the future, including into high rise apartments; thus, securing them for conservation should be an important climate change adaptation strategy for Mai Po, since they provide essential habitats for birds under future climate change scenarios. But Mai Po is only one steppingstone along the EAAF, and hundreds of other wetlands are also threatened by encroaching infrastructure and climate change. Thus, similar analyses for the other wetlands are recommended to develop a flyway-wide climate-adaptation conservation strategy before available options become lost to wetland conversion.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The analysis was supported by the general Mai Po Nature Reserve management fund, which is capitalized from multiple sources and managed by WWF Hong Kong.

The ecological functionality of this migration corridor depends on a network of coastal wetlands that represent steppingstones used by the birds as staging areas and over-wintering sites [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over the past several decades many of the wetlands along the EAAF have been converted for development, from agriculture and aquaculture to coastal infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Over 65% of the intertidal mudflats in the Yellow Sea, one of the more important staging areas along the flyway, have been lost in recent decades [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Continued loss of strategically located wetlands could drastically impact connectivity, preventing birds from completing their migrations, resulting in eventual species population declines, extirpation and eventual collapse of this important ecological and evolutionary phenomenon that has evolved over millennia [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>But like many coastal wetlands across the world the EAAF wetlands are also under additional threat from global climate change and its consequences, notably sea level rise (SLR) and extreme storms that are accompanied by stronger wave and tidal surges [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The impacts of SLR and natural disasters are further compounded by subsidence and decreasing coastal sedimentation that is necessary to counter SLR [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Iwamura et al. [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] estimate that between 23 to 40% of the intertidal habitat will be lost and unavailable for migratory birds along the EAAF because of sea level rise, with some regions losing more than others. Coastal development, which has resulted in loss of wetlands, can now also place the remaining wetlands in a situation where they will be subjected to coastal squeeze; unable to migrate further inland in the event of SLR because of the adjacent hard infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, important wetlands along the flyway should be assessed for the impacts of climate change and associated drivers of ecological and environmental change to plan and implement proactive climate adaptation strategies. These analyses should be conducted at site scales to identify site-scale conservation strategies based on habitat availability, current and planned landuse, and restoration opportunities. Because wetland conversion and coastal development is still continuing apace these analyses are urgently needed before options for conservation and restoration disappear.</p><p>In Hong Kong, projections suggest rising sea levels and warmer, wetter weather that can spawn a higher number of severe typhoons [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. But, while the sea is rising, the deltas and mudflats in the Pearl River Delta could be shrinking. A model of sediment deposition and coastal nourishment of the Pearl River Delta projected that the fluvial sediment supply that fed the Pearl River Delta has decreased by 71% from the previous &#x02018;natural state&#x02019;, and any potential compensation from increased river flows attributed to climate change will only be about 1% of this deficit by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, assuming impacts from human activities are maintained at current levels [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Under this scenario, the coastal zones will be starved of approximately 6,000 Mt of fluvial sediment until the end of this century, which may also result in the erosion and shrinking of the delta, including the inter-tidal mudflat [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In fact, recent studies of the sub-aqueous bathymetry of the Pearl River Delta has shown that sections of the delta are already eroding, or accreting at lower rates [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site in Hong Kong is an important staging and wintering site along the EAAF and supports large numbers of migratory birds, including 24 globally threatened bird species associated with wetlands. Thus, rising sea levels, stronger storm surges and shrinking mudflats will combine to decrease the availability of habitats for the waterbirds in Mai Po in the future, and adaptation plans to counter the threats from climate change and offshore subsidence are needed now to ensure persistence of migrations and flyway functionality. Here, we modelled the impacts of climate change and decreasing sedimentation rates on the important bird habitats in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site to support a climate adaptation strategy that will continue to host migratory waterbirds. To do this, we applied the SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) version 6.7 [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to simulate habitat conversion under selected sea-level rise scenarios for coastal areas in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site and adjacent areas surrounding it.</p><p>This model has been widely used for coastal resource management across the world, including for selected wetlands in the Yellow Sea estuary of China [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Korea [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in the EAAF region. But we note that the lack of data on historic wetland conversion, especially outside North America [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] hinders retrospective analysis, which could be used to calibrate and validate the model. Analyses have shown that elevation data is the most important factor for output accuracy since conversion among habitat classes is mainly governed by elevation [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, a high-resolution DEM is important for generating consistent results. Other site-specific parameters such as tidal range and accretion also affect the model outputs and should therefore be as accurate as possible [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite these shortcomings, SLAMM is the only marsh migration model that handles uncertainty in spatial inputs (DEM, VDATUM, etc.) and parameter choices, and this capability has contributed to its wide use [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site</title><p>The Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site (hereafter Mai Po) is located in the North West New Territories of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), along the southern edges of the Deep Bay of the Pearl River estuary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

Regular visitors to Mai Po include the Endangered Black-faced Spoonbill (<italic>Platalea minor</italic>) and Nordmann&#x02019;s Greenshank (<italic>Tringa guttifer</italic>), and, occasionally, the Critically Endangered Spoon-billed sandpiper (<italic>Calidris pygmaea</italic>). Mai Po played a significant role in the population recovery of the Black-faced spoonbill, and now regularly supports about 7&#x02013;10% of the global population [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In the 1950s, most of the mangroves in Mai Po and surrounding coastal areas were converted to a system of traditional aquaculture pond management known as <italic>gei wai</italic>, where the ponds were connected to the bay via a sluice gate that allows water exchange with the bay. Some mangroves were left to remain in the ponds, and the biomass from the mangroves nourished the shrimp, oysters and fishes that were stocked in the ponds through tidal water exchanges, which also aerated and regularly flushed the ponds. Shrimp were harvested in the summer, and the <italic>gei wai</italic> were drained during the Autumn-Winter for harvesting bigger fishes and maintenance. During this time the birds are able to use them as feeding areas.

We used these accretion rates because historical records (between 1898 and 1949) estimate accretion at 8 mm/year, but the rate had increased to about 15 mm/yr in the 1980&#x02019;s and 1990&#x02019;s, attributed to land clearing for agriculture and development in Shenzhen [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. From the 1990&#x02019;s onwards, there has been a decrease in fluvial sediment supply to the coast, and models suggest that sediment loads are expected to decrease further, by about 70% in the future with sediment trapping behind the Yangtan and Longtan mega dams [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Global temperature increases between 1.9 and 3.1&#x000b0;C can bring about fast Antarctic disintegration that can contribute an additional 0.21 to 0.74 m to SLR this century within 5 and 95% quantiles, respectively, of the RCP 8.5, and contributions of up to 0.45 m for the 95% quantile under RCP 4.5 [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The temperature range includes the 2&#x000b0;C target set by the Paris CoP.

For the high tide scenario, we applied 0.7 m of height difference, which represents half of the total tidal range.

However, projections for 2100 suggest that overall, the mangroves, marshes and tidal flats are impacted in almost all scenarios of SLR and accretion (<xref rid="pone.0239945.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Under a 1.5 m SLR scenario, at low tide there was little change in the tidal mudflats and coastal mangroves if the current accretion levels of 8 mm/yr or more continues into the future (<xref rid="pone.0239945.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g002">Fig 2</xref>). However, if accretion levels decrease, as predicted, to 4 mm/yr, the tidal flats are expected to be inundated even during low tide with over 77% being lost as habitat for wading and shorebirds, while the mangroves remain relatively unaffected (<xref rid="pone.0239945.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g002">Fig 2</xref>). When accretion levels decline to 2 mm/yr, over half the coastal mangroves could also be lost due to permanent inundation of the coastal areas, including during low tide (<xref rid="pone.0239945.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A 1.5 m SLR will also result in a loss of 15 to 18% of inland and open water marshes in the northern reaches of the wetland conservation area (<xref rid="pone.0239945.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These marshes represent the fishponds, and the area bordering the lower reaches of the Shenzhen River and upper estuary, where the river bank is artificially constructed for river training, and there are no coastal mangroves or tidal mudflats. The regularly flooded marshes represent the ponds that support reedbeds in the Nature Reserve, and under a 2 mm/yr accretion rate, over 50% of these marshes will be lost, indicating that some of the ponds that are not connected to the estuary via tidal creeks will also become inundated during low tide under a 1.5 m SLR (<xref rid="pone.0239945.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Asia&#x02019;s coastal areas are among the most densely populated areas, and urban and industrial infrastructure is rapidly expanding at the expense of the natural ecosystems disregarding the importance of the ecosystem services these wetlands provide and the longer term economic and social consequences of losing them [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Over 80% of East and Southeast Asia&#x02019;s wetlands are now classified as threatened and nearly half of all tidal flats have already been lost [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, many of the migratory waterbirds that depend on the wetlands along the EAAF are now facing population declines as important and strategic stopover and winter sites continue to disappear [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While over 5 million individuals from 58 species of shorebirds are known to use the EAAF, it now has the highest number of threatened species and declining populations [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Analyses have shown that less than 10% of the wetlands that support waterbirds are protected, and many important yet unprotected areas are vulnerable to anthropogenic threats [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus, given the rapid loss of wetlands, inadequate protection and conservation management and consequent erosion of ecological connectivity and functionality of the flyway, it is important to secure the remaining wetlands to ensure that the migrations persist [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In addition to protection to prevent anthropogenic conversion, the wetlands and the flyway also require a &#x02018;climate-smart&#x02019; conservation paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As transitional ecosystems between terrestrial and marine systems, coastal wetlands are vulnerable to SLR and the severe storms and associated strong wave surges expected from climate change on one side, and continued land conversion in the terrestrial realm [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

But if the adjacent terrestrial areas are converted to anthropogenic land uses this migration will be constrained and the wetlands will be lost due to coastal squeeze [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. As strategic wetlands along the flyway are lost to development and climate change and consequent environmental impacts, the functionality of the flyway will become degraded, and the migration phenomenon could eventually cease.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Climate smarting the wetlands: The case of the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site</title><p>As an important steppingstone and wintering wetland for waterbirds along the EAAF, Mai Po represents a case study of how a climate adaptation strategy can be integrated into conservation management. The results from our climate model shows that over 230 ha of tidal flats, which are critically important habitats, could become unavailable by the end of the century even under the more conservative estimate of 1.5 m SLR if accretion levels drop to below 8 mm/yr. This will greatly reduce the capacity of the Ramsar site to support the numbers of waterbirds that currently use it. A lower accretion rate will inundate the mangroves, and estuarine water intrusion could extend into the ponds inside the nature reserve. At high tide there will be more extensive inundation of the nature reserve and some of the marshes in the northern extents of the Wetland Conservation Area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These marshes&#x02014;categorized as such for the SLAMM&#x02014;are represented by fishponds. An analysis that applied SLAMM to coastal wetlands in Korea also showed similar results, where the tidal flats were lost to rising sea levels, with inundation of adjacent rice fields [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In China&#x02019;s Yangtze River estuary, models predict that accelerating sea level rise, land subsidence and low sediment accretion could result in considerable or complete loss of coastal wetland habitats [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, the climate change scenario in Mai Po is consistent with the dynamics in other coastal wetlands along the flyway.</p><p>The <italic>gei wai</italic> and ponds inside the Mai Po Nature Reserve, which forms the core zone of the Ramsar site, are intensively managed by WWF Hong Kong for about 40 years, under contract from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of the HKSAR Government, according to 5-year prescriptive management plans. However, the tidal flats and the coastal mangroves remain largely unmanaged, with the exception of a 45 ha area in front of four floating bird watching hides to remove invasive sedges, grasses and mangrove seedlings that encroach into the mudflat. Management of the ponds in the nature reserve include maintaining islands, draining the ponds to re-contour the bottom to maintain the diversity of deep and shallow water habitats to support the assemblage of birds that require different habitats, and adapting the open areas to accommodate different species based on analysis of pond use by birds. While deeper ponds are maintained for the ducks and grebes, shallow water ponds and islands are maintained as high tide roosting sites for the shorebirds and waders when the tidal flats are inundated. Although these habitats are relatively well protected from direct anthropogenic land conversion due to the protected areas status of the nature reserve, the SLAMM outputs suggests that these habitats are vulnerable to the manifestations of global climate change. If SLR and declining sedimentation results in inundation of the tidal flats, coastal mangroves, and ponds in the nature reserve, the birds will lose habitat.</p><p>Because of sediment trapping by two large dams upstream in the Pearl River, there is expected to be a &#x0003e;70% decrease in fluvial sediment supply, and the coastal zone will be starved sediment deposition causing the Pearl River Delta to erode and shrink [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, there is a high likelihood that the tidal flat will also erode, and happen even faster, and large areas of important habitat for the wading and shorebirds will be lost sooner than expected.</p><p>But the climate model suggests that the fishponds along the inland boundary and the southern areas of the Ramsar site, especially in Lut Chau and Nam Sang Wai, will be relatively less impacted by SLR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239945.g003">3</xref>). A few of the southern fishponds are outside the Ramsar site boundary but are still within the Wetland Conservation Area. Securing these fishponds for conservation should be a climate change adaptation strategy for Mai Po, since they could become wetland habitats for birds under future climate change scenarios, especially serving as high tide roosting sites when the ponds in the nature reserve are inundated. Artificial wetlands such as fishponds already serve as supratidal habitats for waterbirds during high tide when tidal flats are inundated even in other stopover sites and wintering areas across the flyway [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. But, while some of the wetlands are owned by the HKSAR Government and under the management jurisdiction of the AFCD, most wetlands in the Wetland Conservation Area are privately owned, including by property developers who have leased them to aquaculturists to manage and operate as commercial fishponds. Under HKSAR Government regulations, the wetlands and fishponds in the Wetland Conservation Area are protected but can be converted based on the approval of the Town Planning Board. Thus, there is an imminent danger of the fishponds being converted into hard infrastructure, including high rise buildings. Such development will result in loss of potential habitat and conservation opportunities, and also create hard, impervious surfaces that effectively cause flooding elsewhere, and will be more difficult and economically unviable to restore back to wetlands in the future. An analysis of coastal squeeze in the Yellow River Delta has shown that farmlands, including those claimed from wetlands, allowed the potential for wetland migration and restoration because they are more pervious, relative to wetlands that had been converted to hard infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Ecosystems as climate proofing solutions for Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area</title><p>Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and important ecosystems in the world [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

This area is also recognized as the main landfall area of tropical cyclones and typhoons from the Northwest Pacific and the South China Sea, with the typhoons being stronger and more intense, and accompanied by stronger storm surges [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Records from 1991 and 2005 show that storm surges, in effect, created a SLR of between 1.9 and 2.6 m in the Pearl River Delta [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], while severe typhoons can create surges that are as high as 4 m [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, much of the Pearl River Delta and Greater Bay Area could be vulnerable to extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, including SLR, floods caused by wave surges, saltwater intrusion, and an increase in the severity of storms [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239945.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Coastal wetlands also buffer and attenuate storm surges and reduce property damage and loss of lives along the coastlines [<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239945.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

Both reviewers think this work is an important contribution in waterbirds conservation in eastern Asia. But they also raised some concerns such as the model limitations, constrains and accuracy. In addition, as suggested by one reviewer, it will be better to give some conservation advice in the discussion part. I also think the manuscript will be improved by taking these comments into account.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The authors modelled the change in coastal landscape in an important waterbird area under different SLR and accretion scenarios. The authors then concluded that substantial amount of migratory bird habitat will be lost in 2100 under the predicted accretion rate and 1.5-2.0m SLR scenarios. This is study is critically important in conservation management and I added a few comments below which could be used to improve the manuscript.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>1. Given the modelling nature of this manuscript, please add a paragraph or section, to discuss briefly the limitations and constrains of this SLAMM approach. Has this model been tested? What was the accuracy? A brief discussion on these will allow less-experienced readers to evaluate the evidence and follow more easily.</p><p>2. Line 352 &#x02013; this is an important paragraph but this also mean it's critically important to evaluate the model's accuracy, and the probability of errors &#x02013; which could lead to the purchase of less useful area. Could the authors also demonstrate how much longer will other potential buffer area (ponds around Lut Chau and Nam Sang Wai) last for? If it's just 10-20 years, then is it really a sustainable solution?</p><p>3. From the waterbirds' perspective, e.g. shorebirds, this paper could be improved substantially by considering the entire Deep Bay instead of having an arbitrary cut off in the middle of the tidal flat. Many of the birds in Maipo are also known to the mainland China side of Deep Bay and leaving the other half out could only reveal partly how waterbird&#x02019;s habitat will change in the future.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Lines 27, 285, 393 &#x02013; consider the use of &#x0201c;migration phenomenon&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;migration&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 119 &#x02013; please provide the GPS coordinate, perhaps the centroid of Maipo</p><p>Line 133 &#x02013; capitalize &#x0201c;E&#x0201d;ndangered</p><p>Line 136 &#x02013; citation needed, consider the BFS annual census report or Sung et al. 2018</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.doi.org">www.doi.org</ext-link>/10.1017/S0959270917000016</p><p>Line 165 &#x02013; please provide a bit more details since accretion can still be clearly felt today, any information on when will the land clearing and development be stopped? How much of the accretion may come from natural runoffs?</p><p>Line 177 &#x02013; the degree symbol looks more like a zero instead</p><p>Line 222 &#x02013; Please explain what do low and high tides mean here (are they an average?), since substantial differences could be found between spring and neap tides</p><p>Line 252 &#x02013; may also consider the latest publication related to hunting by Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108582">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108582</ext-link></p><p>Line 339 &#x02013; may also consider the latest publication by Jackson et al. 2020 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108591">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108591</ext-link></p><p>Reviewer #2: The authors modelled the impacts of climate change and decreasing sedimentation rates on</p><p>important bird habitats in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site to support a climate</p><p>adaptation strategy that will continue to host migratory birds. The text is grammatically under understandable, although English to be reviewed before considering it to publication. In addition, some of references are not in our style, which are close but not completely correct.</p><p>The work of this paper is practical and logical, it provides a great contribution to the literature on how the important bird habitats change in different future scenario. However, there are some main problems to be further improved as well, I listed some specific comments below:</p><p>As we know, the climate change and human disturbance are the main driving force of the coastal wetland change in the world. Base on the result, it seems the climate change is not the principal threat of the Mai Po till 2075. Hong Kong and Shenzhen both are the biggest city in the world. So, in the discussion, it needs to give more conservation advice or reflection, how to control or monitor the sediment. Such as, at the 2100: 2m SLR; 2mm accretion; High Tide scenario, it need build more high-tide habitat for waterbirds. Or we need to keep the sediment stabilize, try to avoid the construction and the activities of changing the ecological processes of wetland, e.g. Shenzhen Bay dredging for cruise recently.</p><p>It is better put the Low tide image and Hide tide of the same scenario together and it will be easy to check the impact for the migratory waterbird.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

The specific roles of these authors are articulated in the &#x02018;author contributions&#x02019; section. FC and AS received a consultancy from WWF Hong Kong through Here+There Mapping Solutions, to run the SLAMM model. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.&#x0201d;</p><p>4. Data Availability statement. We will upload the underlying SLAMM datalayers to Zenodo</p><p>Reviewer&#x02019;s Comments to the Authors</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>General comments:</p><p>1. Given the modelling nature of this manuscript, please add a paragraph or section, to discuss briefly the limitations and constrains of this SLAMM approach. Has this model been tested? What was the accuracy? A brief discussion on these will allow less-experienced readers to evaluate the evidence and follow more easily.</p><p>Author response: We have added some text to clarify the limitations and constraints of the SLAMM approach (lines 115-125). We also have text and provided references to show that the model has been applied to wetlands globally, including to wetlands in China and Korea, along the EAAF. We hope this will suffice.</p><p>2. Line 352 &#x02013; this is an important paragraph but this also mean it's critically important to evaluate the model's accuracy, and the probability of errors &#x02013; which could lead to the purchase of less useful area. Could the authors also demonstrate how much longer will other potential buffer area (ponds around Lut Chau and Nam Sang Wai) last for? If it's just 10-20 years, then is it really a sustainable solution?</p><p>Author response: Presumably this refers to the paragraph starting on line 331 (in the previous, uncorrected document). Only way to show that the wetlands will survive more than 10-20 years beyond 2100 would be to run the model for another 25 and/or 50 years. But increasing the time horizon will mean that the model outputs will also become less accurate and outputs less reliable.</p><p>However, we also note that our recommendations to conserving Lut Chau and Nam Sang Wai fishponds do not necessarily recommend purchasing these lands, but that they not be converted to hard infrastructure now or in the near future. They are currently maintained as fishponds, which are de-facto wetlands and are used by some waterbirds as supratidal wetlands. They can also be more easily and cost-effectively restored as wetlands for waterbirds as an adaptation strategy in the future, if not converted to hard infrastructure. Therefore, our proposal to maintain the wetlands is not on a timescale of 10-20 years beyond 2100, but starting now. </p><p>3. From the waterbirds' perspective, e.g. shorebirds, this paper could be improved substantially by considering the entire Deep Bay instead of having an arbitrary cut off in the middle of the tidal flat. Many of the birds in Maipo are also known to the mainland China side of Deep Bay and leaving the other half out could only reveal partly how waterbird&#x02019;s habitat will change in the future.</p><p>Author response: The reviewer is partly correct; the Deep Bay should be considered as an ecologically connected flyway site. However, while Mai Po and the mudflat area that was considered in the analysis is in Hong Kong SAR, the rest of the Deep Bay is under administration of the mainland China government, and we have been unable to acquire the required data layers to extend the analysis beyond Mai Po. </p><p>Moreover, the objective of our analysis was to identify and recommend an adaptation strategy for the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site. Site-scaled analyses can be more relevant, sensitive, and contextual for site-based conservation management plans. However, we then go on to recommend that similar analyses be conducted for important sites along the EAAF that can be aggregated for a holistic, flyway-scaled adaptation strategy. </p><p>Applying the model to larger scales will result in loss of site-specific sensitivity and cause important management recommendations to be glossed over. This has been a problem with many regional and global-scaled analyses that lose site-specific context. </p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Lines 27, 285, 393 &#x02013; consider the use of &#x0201c;migration phenomenon&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;migration&#x0201d;</p><p>Author response: changes made.</p><p>Line 119 &#x02013; please provide the GPS coordinate, perhaps the centroid of Maipo</p><p>Author response: The maps (Figure 1), which is meant to be a location map, provides the coordinates.</p><p>Line 133 &#x02013; capitalize &#x0201c;E&#x0201d;ndangered</p><p>Author response: changes made.</p><p>Line 136 &#x02013; citation needed, consider the BFS annual census report or Sung et al. 2018 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.doi.org">www.doi.org</ext-link>/10.1017/S0959270917000016</p><p>Author response: reference added</p><p>Line 165 &#x02013; please provide a bit more details since accretion can still be clearly felt today, any information on when will the land clearing and development be stopped? How much of the accretion may come from natural runoffs?</p><p>Author response: We have tried to clarify some of the time correlation between land-clearing and development trends and accretion, as requested by the reviewer as best as possible based on available published data. However, we also note that there is no reliable literature on current accretion rates. A monitoring study is now underway, but the data have not been published. We have thus provided the best available information and base our choice of parameters on these studies. As such, we have used&#x02014;and presented&#x02014;the range of possible accretion rate scenarios in our analyses. </p><p>We were unable to find any reliable information on the contributions of natural runoff-based accretion (except the historical data that we use) and that attributed to land clearing. But we also note that such a breakdown is immaterial to our analysis, except to make landuse, land conversion, and restoration recommendations, which we do in a general way. We also note that this would be an important follow up study but would have to be undertaken in collaboration with researchers from mainland China since most of the upstream impacts from runoff originates there.</p><p>Line 177 &#x02013; the degree symbol looks more like a zero instead</p><p>Author response: change made.</p><p>Line 222 &#x02013; Please explain what do low and high tides mean here (are they an average?), since substantial differences could be found between spring and neap tides</p><p>Author response: text added (lines change made 208-217).</p><p>Line 252 &#x02013; may also consider the latest publication related to hunting by Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108582">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108582</ext-link></p><p>Author response: reference added</p><p>Line 339 &#x02013; may also consider the latest publication by Jackson et al. 2020 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108591">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108591</ext-link></p><p>Author response: reference added</p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>As we know, the climate change and human disturbance are the main driving force of the coastal wetland change in the world. Base on the result, it seems the climate change is not the principal threat of the Mai Po till 2075. Hong Kong and Shenzhen both are the biggest city in the world. So, in the discussion, it needs to give more conservation advice or reflection, how to control or monitor the sediment. Such as, at the 2100: 2m SLR; 2mm accretion; High Tide scenario, it need build more high-tide habitat for waterbirds. Or we need to keep the sediment stabilize, try to avoid the construction and the activities of changing the ecological processes of wetland, e.g. Shenzhen Bay dredging for cruise recently.</p><p>Author response: We agree that in addition to climate change impacts there are very severe and more proximal direct and indirect anthropogenic threats to Mai Po and the Deep Bay. Some of these can be effectively mitigated, while others would require an adaptation strategy. What we have provided through this analysis is an adaptation strategy to the expected impacts of climate change. Monitoring and tackling the more proximal anthropogenic impacts, while also critically important, is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have provided general recommendations on how nature-based solutions are required in the Greater Bay in an entire sub-section entitled &#x0201c;Ecosystems as climate proofing solutions for Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area&#x0201d; in the Discussion, especially with respect to &#x02018;climate proofing&#x02019; the bay. </p><p>1. It is better put the Low tide image and Hide tide of the same scenario together and it will be easy to check the impact for the migratory waterbird.</p><p>Author response: We debated and thought through what the best way to group the maps would be, and eventually chose to group the low tide scenarios together to show that even during low tide, important bird habitats can be submerged under low sedimentation rate scenarios. And then to show the corresponding scenarios under high tide scenarios. Thus, while we concede that there are several ways to group these maps, we have chosen what we think is the best way to show what we wanted to show.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0239945.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0239945.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0239945.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0239945.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Yong Zhang</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Yong Zhang</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0239945" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
