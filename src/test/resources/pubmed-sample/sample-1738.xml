However, its precision and efficiency in vivo remains to be addressed. Here we achieve A-to-G conversion in vivo at frequencies up to 100% by microinjection of ABE mRNA together with sgRNAs. We then generate mouse models harboring clinically relevant mutations at <italic>Ar</italic> and <italic>Hoxd13</italic>, which recapitulates respective clinical defects. Furthermore, we achieve both C-to-T and A-to-G base editing by using a combination of ABE and SaBE3, thus creating mouse model harboring multiple mutations. We also demonstrate the specificity of ABE by deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Taken together, ABE is highly efficient and precise in vivo, making it feasible to model and potentially cure relevant genetic diseases.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">CRISPR-based base editors allow for single nucleotide genome editing in a range of organisms.

However, 48% of genetic diseases involve C-to-T substitution, and modeling or correcting such diseases requires the adenine base editor (ABE) systems that convert A-to-G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. One ABE (version 7.10) has been recently developed by protein artificial evolution, which consists of a wild-type (ecTadA) and an engineered (ecTadA*) adenine deaminase domains fused in tandem to the N terminus of Cas9 D10A nickase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Its success in A-to-G conversion in vitro prompted us to determine its efficacy in vivo. To this end, we targeted androgen receptor (<italic>Ar</italic>) and homeobox D13 (<italic>Hoxd13</italic>), which are known to be associated with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and Syndactyly, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar">http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar</ext-link>).

Plasmids expressing sgRNA and ABE were co-transfected with the GFP-to-BFP reporter and the green-to-blue fluorescence conversion quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In all, 8% of BFP-positive cells were detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), and Sanger sequencing of the targeted region revealed A-to-G substitution at the same frequency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), indicating that ABE is functional.

ABE mRNA was co-injected with different sgRNAs into one-cell embryos (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), most of which developed normally to blastocyst (17 out of 18, 20 out of 22, and 13 out of 14 for sgAr-1, sgAr-15, and sgHoxd13, respectively) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>), indicating that ABE did not affect embryo development. Analysis of 14&#x02013;16 blastocysts revealed highly efficient editing, with the expected substitutions detected in all embryos and the mutation frequencies ranging from 8 to 100% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Then 16 embryos from both sgAr-1 and sgAr-15, and all 14 embryos from sgHoxd13 were used for genotyping.</p><p id="Par6">Specifically, for sgAr-1, A-to-G substitutions occurred at positions 3 and 7 as expected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). As the substitution at position 3 is a silent mutation, only S683G mutation derived from A<sub>7</sub> was detected in all embryos (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, d</xref>). Besides, in Embryos #7, #12, and #16, unwanted C-to-G or C-to-A at position 5 and T-to-C at position 11 were observed at frequencies of 13, 8, and 10%, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>), leading to corresponding amino-acid changes (S682C, S682Y, and L684P, respectively) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). For sgAr-15, all embryos harbored A-to-G substitution only at position 4 at frequencies ranging from 8 to 71% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). Consequently, I878T amino-acid conversion occurred over all embryos (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b, d</xref>). Similarly, expected A-to-G substitution at position 6 of sgHoxd13 target site was detected in all the tested embryos (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). Also, A-to-G substitution in the editing windows was detected at positions 8 (Embryos #1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 14) and 9 (Embryo #9) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). Consequently, expected amino-acid conversion Q321R occurred at high frequency (66.6%) compared with N322D (12.6%, the average frequency of the tested embryos) and N322S (0.9%, the average frequency of the tested embryos) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that ABE efficiently edits endogenous genes in mouse embryos without impairing development. Of note, there is only one A in the editing window (protospacer positions 4&#x02013;7) of sgAr-15, and so only one modified genotype was generated (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b, d</xref>), suggesting that it is desirable to select a sgRNA with one targetable site inside the edit window to achieve isogenic modification, which should produce isogenic homozygous mutation, a desirable outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Generation of pathogenic A-to-G mouse models</title><p id="Par7">With this success, we set out to generate A-to-G mutant mice by co-injecting ABE mRNA (100&#x02009;ng/&#x000b5;l) with sgRNA (50&#x02009;ng/&#x000b5;l) into zygotes. A total of 80, 80, and 63 zygotes for sgAr-1, sgAr-15, and sgHoxd13 were injected and transferred into 4, 4, and 3 surrogate mice, which generated 22, 19, and 32 offspring, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Targeted mutations by sgAr-1, sgAr-15, and sgHoxd13 were detected in 100, 95, and 81% pups, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a&#x02013;d</xref>).

As expected, sgAr-1 introduced mutation at position 3 (A<sub>3</sub>, L681L) and position 7 (A<sub>7</sub>, S683G) of the protospacer, while sgAr-15 introduced mutation at position 4 (A<sub>4</sub>, I878T) of the protospacer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d</xref>).

Interestingly, 1 out of the 15 male founders for sgAr-1 (Founder A021) and 3 out of the 10 founders for sgAr-15 (Founders, A061-A063) displayed typical AIS symptom with female external genitalia (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). Founder A021 for sgAr-1 and A063 for sgAr-15 were selected to confirm the sex reversal phenotype by autopsy.

We hypothesized that mosaicism of the base editing caused the inconsistency of the phenotype. To test this, we assessed the editing efficiency of the testes from six mice (A001, A009, A014, A021, A052 and A063) harboring ~100% editing frequency in tails. Indeed, for A001, A009, A014, and A052, which did not display any phenotype, the frequencies of A-to-G substitutions at position A<sub>7</sub> (S683G) in testes were only 42, 4, 17 and 38%, respectively.
