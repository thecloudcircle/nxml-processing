The dysphagia causes food retention in the esophagus, leading to distention and severe nocturnal regurgitation. Associate complications include pulmonary complications from chronic food aspiration and esophageal carcinoma. Therefore, early detection and treatment are essential for the prevention of these complications.</p><p>Recently, novel less invasive treatment, &#x0201c;per-oral endoscopic myotomy; POEM&#x0201d;, has been introduced [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. POEM procedure has been performed for more than 60 cases in our institution between August 2010 and October 2013. Since the introduction, 71 cases of esophageal achalasia that includes 56 patients with no previous treatment referred to our hospital. Seventeen of all 56 cases took longer than 10 years to be diagnosed as an esophageal achalasia. Some patients were not diagnosed properly even after multiple sessions of endoscopic examination. Indeed, endoscopic features including substantial dilatation with tortuosity or large amount of food remnant are listed in the characteristic indicators for achalasia. These findings are visible as its radiological manifestations and generally occur with advancement of the condition. On the other hand, achalasia patients in earlier stage do not necessarily have such typical macroscopic features. Again, discrete luminal dilatation and esophageal residue and the sensation of narrowness through esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) could be missed easily during endoscopy because of the poor reproducibility and objectivity.</p><p>Esophageal manometry provides a definitive diagnostic method for achalasia. In Japan, however, this procedure is not commonly used; instead, endoscopists take charge of the first examination via esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for symptomatic cases of achalasia. Nevertheless, there have been quite a few reports regarding endoscopic diagnostics of achalasia. Iwakiri et al reported the significance of rosette-like esophageal folds in the limited area of lower esophagus as one of endoscopic findings of achalasia [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In their series, EGD was subjectively performed in a conscious state requiring deep inhale, which would be almost impossible under sedation. Therefore, it is of clinical importance to find additional endoscopic appearance of esophageal achalasia to diagnose accurately and consistently especially in the patients who do not have typical macroscopic findings of the disease.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to analyze the endoscopic features of esophageal achalasia. During routine endoscopy, we frequently noticed minute stripes forming a &#x0201c;pinstripe pattern (PSP)&#x0201d; on the esophageal surface of the patients. Therefore, we compared the endoscopic findings recommended by the Descriptive Rules for Achalasia of the Esophagus published in 2012 by the Japan Society of Esophageal Diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 71 cases of esophageal achalasia underwent endoscopy at our institution between August 2010 and October 2013.

Because achalasia commonly occurs in relatively young females, these patients are sometimes misdiagnosed with psychological disorders including anorexia nervosa without proper medical assessment and examination. Furthermore, even proper examination may not detect esophageal achalasia [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There have been few reports focusing on endoscopic diagnosis of achalasia.</p><p>The achalasia population is also known as a high-risk group for esophageal cancer. Persistent esophageal distention causes retention of the food and liquid remnant, bacterial overgrowth, and impaired clearance of regurgitated acid and gastric contents, all leading to chronic inflammation and passively causing dysphagia and carcinoma[<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In fact, 3 patients (4.2%) developed esophageal cancer in 71 achalasia patients that were admitted in our hospital. On the basis of prior data, the overall prevalence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in patients with achalasia has been estimated to be up to 8.6%, accounting for a 50-fold increase in cancer risk [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous studies showed that it would take on average 24 (range 10&#x02013;43) years to establish carcinoma after symptom onset, and 3 to 4 years for carcinoma to develop from dysplasia [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All 3 patients who developed esophageal cancer at our institution had symptoms of esophageal achalasia for &#x0003e;20 years of the disease history. The recent development of less invasive and curative treatments against esophageal achalasia emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis for esophageal achalasia. Now, we insist that the significance of diagnosing achalasia in their early phases should be reconsidered.</p><p>Recent advance in the treatment of esophageal motility diseases like Heller myotomy[<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and POEM[<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] captured the attentions of clinicians and the general public. When patients become aware of their dysphagia status, the first specialist they contact is generally a gastroenterologist or endoscopist.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential to establish the simple and reliable disease indicators for esophagogram and manometry. Incidentally, validating PSP requires no special skills or instruments including dye spray or magnification. PSP is detectable with white light observation, although indigocarmine can be helpful for clear recognition. This pattern is detectable even when patients are under deep sedation. Because esophageal achalasia occurs in relatively younger populations who usually require conscious sedation even for routine endoscopy examination, this offers another advantage.</p><p>The inter-observer agreement analysis revealed that the other parameters evaluated in the current report were unreliable, even food/liquid remnants (&#x003ba; = 0.6861). These data are consistent with our multivariate analyses showing no statistical significance between each endoscopic finding and patients&#x02019; characteristics such as history duration, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure before the treatment, esophageal dilation grade, or subjective symptom score (Eckardt score) [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These indicators may be highly unreliable because of their high subjectivity. However, a matched case-control study reported the presence of rosette-like esophageal folds in 97.1% of 34 patients diagnosed with achalasia without esophageal dilatation [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, deep inhale is mandatory to determine the presence of rosette-like appearance, which is almost impossible under deep sedation.</p><p>The present study supports PSP for the early detection of esophageal achalasia. The pattern was observed in 73.9% (17/23) of the patients exhibiting symptoms for &#x0003c;5 years. In contrast, the prevalence rate was only 25.0% (2/8) for patients with a history &#x0003e;20 years. These patients typically exhibit severe thickening of the entire mucosal layer, including the epithelium and musclaris mucosa, with extensive submucosal fibrosis. These data suggest that PSP is related to early changes in the superficial epithelium before entire layer thickening after many years of food stasis.</p><p>Characteristic endoscopic feature of eosinophilic esophagitis is also known to be linear furrows, white plaques, and esophageal rings [<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0101833.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Also, wide longitudinal fold, which disappears as air is fully insufflated, can be observed. It was clearly distinguished from PSP observed in esophageal achalasia. Eosinophilic esophagitis was excluded pathologically in all the achalasia cases.</p><p>Still, the cause and the meaning of this finding are unclear. Pathological confirmation of the appearance and longer observation is awaited to elucidate the mechanism of PSP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study supports esophageal superficial longitudinal PSP as a possible indicator for identifying patients needing further evaluation for esophageal achalasia by esophagogram and manometry. These results are exploratory and further studies are needed in order to confirm these results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Enago (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.enago.jp/">http://www.enago.jp</ext-link>) for the English language review.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0101833.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
