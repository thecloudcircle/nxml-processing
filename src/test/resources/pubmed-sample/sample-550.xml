The SPB lifecycle and soybean pod and seed developmental stages usually occur at the same time. Generally, the adult SPB oviposit on young bean pods from mid-July till the end of August. Upon hatching the young larvae enter the pods and start feeding therein using the immature seeds as a food source until they develop into mature larvae [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Soybean pod borer could damage 10%-20% of soybean seeds annually [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the damage could be over 30&#x02013;40% if a pest outbreak occurs and timely preventive measures are not implemented properly [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, SPB infestations also deformed the seeds and thus affect quality and sale prices of the soybean harvest.</p><p>In the last three decades, various chemical insecticides have been extensively used to control SPB in soybeans plantations [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The exposed period of larvae before they enter the pods (roughly about a single day) is not enough for contact insecticides to work out properly [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], thus it is difficult for the insecticides to contact and kill the pest under a closed canopy [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, insecticides adversely affect the beneficial natural enemies [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], induce the development of insecticide-resistant populations of pest insects and cause environmental pollution [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, it is pivotal to look for measures that control the pest and prevent the crop economic loss and also have no or less adverse effect on natural enemies, environment and human health. In this respect, modifying genes using plant-mediated RNA-interference is a promising strategy for controlling SPB infestations [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, the somewhat conservative polices and legal obstacles to transgenic crops in many countries limited the applications of this procedure in soybean [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, certain sex pheromones have also been chemically identified and used to monitor population dynamics and control SPB by mating disruption [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The use of resistant cultivars is also an effective way for reducing insect pest damage in combination with other non-chemical control measures [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Unfortunately these pest control methods cannot fully suppress soybean pod borer and there is still need of some more effective and sustainable measures to keep the pest under check for long time to get substantial yield of soybean.</p><p>The genus <italic>Trichogramma</italic> is endoparasitoid of insect eggs and there are approximately 650 species of egg parasitoids worldwide, of which more than 200 species can parasitize the eggs of crop and forest pests [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Successful control in the field has been reported in several countries using <italic>Trichogramma</italic> against the European corn borer, <italic>Ostrinia nubilalis</italic> (H&#x000fc;bner) [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the polyphagous grapevine moth, <italic>Lobesia botrana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], cabbage pests [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], <italic>Tuta absoluta</italic> on tomato [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the oriental fruit moth <italic>Grapholita molesta</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In China, a mass production system is being developed for <italic>Trichogramma</italic> spp. to maintain good quality parasitoids to augment the successful biological control applications for various crops [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Several wasp&#x02019;s species are mass-produced and released in large quantities e.g. <italic>Trichogramma dendrolimi</italic> to control the Asian corn borer <italic>Ostrinia furnacalis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the 1980s and 1990s, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>dendrolimi</italic> is inundatively released annually across 0.2 to 0.35 million ha of corn to suppress <italic>O</italic>. <italic>furnacalis</italic> and was increased to 2.3 million ha annually since 2012 in Jilin, China [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To attempt to use <italic>Trichogramma</italic> against SPB, indigenous SPB egg parasitoids were initiated in late 2010. Three <italic>Trichogramma</italic> species (<italic>Trichogramma chilonis</italic> Ishii, <italic>Trichogramma ostriniae</italic> Pang &#x00026; Chen, and <italic>Trichogramma leucaniae</italic> Pang &#x00026; Chen) were collected from northeastern China soybean fields [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Through testing their suitability on eggs of different-age SPB, eventually <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> was found to be the most valuable biological control agent against the Soybean pod borers [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p><italic>Trichogramma</italic> parasitoids are mostly produced on factitious hosts, usually on the small eggs of <italic>Corcyra cephalonica</italic>, <italic>Ephestia kuehniella</italic> and <italic>Sitotroga cerealella</italic> which are not economical [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Small egg hosts, especially <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cephalonica</italic>, can only produce a wasp per egg, which leads to higher production costs. Moreover, storage of these eggs for more than 2&#x02013;3 weeks at low temperatures can decrease their suitability for mass rearing [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The large eggs of <italic>Antheraea pernyi</italic> are considered to be better factitious hosts with some practical advantages, such as a higher <italic>Trichogramma</italic> reproduction rates with 60&#x02013;70 wasps per egg [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Larger <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> eggs also offer increased convenience for storage and transportation and thus can lower the production costs, compared to the small eggs used for the mass rearing of <italic>Trichogramma</italic> parasitoids [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, some limiting factors e.g. thick and hard chorion of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> eggs make it difficult for some parasitoids, such as <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ostriniae</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>evanesens</italic>, and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>embryophagum</italic>, adults to make a hole and crawl out of the eggs upon completion of their life cycle [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For other parasitoids such as <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic>, only a low percentage of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> eggs were parasitized that resulted in low parasitoid emergence [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Generally, most of the <italic>Trichogramma</italic> parasitoids cannot be massively produced using the eggs of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> except for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>dendrolimi</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>chilonis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>However, the laboratory studies showed that <italic>Trichogrammatoidea hypsipylae</italic> was the most suitable candidate to control <italic>Conopomorpha sinensis</italic>, but it could not emerge from the parasitized eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic>. After <italic>T</italic>. <italic>hypsipylae</italic> were successively reared for 35 generations on the eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cephalonica</italic>, however, the wasps could successfully emerge from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> eggs [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, in the present study, we attempted to domesticate the breeding of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> on large eggs of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> by successive generations and compare their parasitism and suitability on different-aged SPB eggs with those reared on the small eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cephalonica</italic>. The objective was to provide valuable techniques and information for mass production of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> to control SPB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Parasitoids</title><p>The parasitoids, <italic>Trichogramma leucaniae</italic> were originally collected from soybean fields from sentinel SPB eggs in Heihe, Heilongjiang Province, China. The collection of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> did not involve endangered or protected species, and no specific permissions were required. The parasitoid species was identified using SEM micrographs by examining male genital capsules [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and then confirmed the analysis by rDNA-ITS2 sequences (GenBank Accession no.

Then, eggs of the experiment were collected by dissecting the abdomen of a mature female moth and were washed with distilled water. Immature green eggs were removed, and healthy eggs were then air dried under laboratory conditions.

A previous study confirmed that parasitoid host acceptance behavior is flexible and shows a change from the inadaptation to the adaptation on the new host and new environment [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, the host adaptation is different among various species of parasitoids. For example, the rearing of <italic>Trichogramma semifumatum</italic> on <italic>Sitotroga cerealella</italic> eggs for 3 generations weakened their host preference to <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerealella</italic> eggs [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], whereas some other <italic>Trichogramma</italic> species need rearing for many generations to change their preferences and other traits to adapt to the new hosts and exhibit high parasitic capacities [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In our study, however, the unsuitability of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> was found to increase with increasing generations after being successively reared on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> for 4 generations. This was noticed by the parasitism rate that decreased, and the pre-emergence time that was prolonged. The same phenomenon also existed in the continuous rearing of <italic>Trichogramma</italic> on other alternative hosts. For instance, after rearing on <italic>Anagasta kuehniella</italic> (Zeller) for 32 generations, the parasitism rate of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>pretiosum</italic> decreased and the developmental time was prolonged [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Host unsuitability is also exhibited in the agility of parasitoids. In fact, Dutton and Begler [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported that rearing <italic>Trichogramma brassicae</italic> Bezdenko on <italic>Ephestia kuehniella</italic> Zeller eggs for more than 39 generations resulted in deformed wings and poor flying capacity of the parasitoid wasps. Similarly, a decline in quality has been observed in <italic>Trichogramma</italic> reared continuously in the laboratory on the same factitious host [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This shows that the adaptability of parasitoids decreases, and their populations degenerate on alternative hosts after reproduction for many generations, due to various factors such as host&#x02019;s nutritional quality. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically introduce field individuals to reduce the possible losses of parasitoid quality during mass production and augmentative biological control of pests using <italic>Trichogramma</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the large eggs of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> can produce more wasps, with the most of them being able to mate before emerging. Therefore, inbreeding is very common in <italic>Trichogramma</italic> reared on large eggs, which may cause <italic>Trichogramma</italic> depression and thus increases their unsuitability. Of course, several studies have documented that <italic>Trichogramma</italic> are not subjected to inbreeding depression [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, Antolin [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] in his study showed that the total fecundity of inbred <italic>T</italic>. <italic>pretiosum</italic> females represented only 78% of outcrossed females fecundity, thus indicating inbreeding depression. According to Sorati et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], an inbred strain still adapts much more slowly to an artificial environment than an outbred strain because of the initial low levels of genetic variance for traits under selection. Hence, more work is needed to confirm the effects of inbreeding on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic>.</p><p>According to Harvey [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], inconstant states and variable conditions of host quality, such as species, size, age and nutritional status, can affect the parasitoid growth, development and survival. So, as the <italic>Trichogramma</italic> wasps generally rely on a limited amount of resources to complete their development, selecting an optimum host plays a pivotal role in their reproduction. Our results showed that the numbers of SPB eggs of different ages parasitized by the fourth generation of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> reared on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> were significantly higher than those parasitized by the wasps reared on small eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cephalonica</italic>, which is consistent with previous studies. For instance, Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported that the parasitization capacity of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>dendrolimi</italic> females reared on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> was significantly higher than those reared on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cephalonica</italic> eggs, as shown by the differences in the percentage of females with successful parasitization, the number of host eggs parasitized per female, and the percentage of host eggs parasitized in 24 h. Moreover, <italic>Trichogramma</italic> emerging from large hosts were larger in size and developed faster than those emerging from small hosts [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This is due to the fact that large hosts provide more nutrition and thus produce larger and stronger offspring, which might be able to fly farther per unit time and might be more efficient in searching and attacking hosts in the field than smaller individuals. Hence resultantly, larger wasps are more fecund, long-lived, parasitize more hosts, and produce more progeny than their smaller conspecifics [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Host age is an important factor that influences the availability and parasitoid acceptance of hosts. Generally, younger eggs have more yolk and are more nutritious, and are preferred by most <italic>Trichogramma spp</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Hou et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reported five <italic>Trichogramma</italic> species that parasitized <italic>Mythimna separata</italic> at all egg ages, but also reported that three <italic>Trichogramma</italic> species, namely <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ostriniae</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic>, and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> showed higher parasitism efficiency only on 0-day-old eggs. In the present study, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> reared on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> also parasitized the most SPB eggs at the age of 0-day-old. The number of host eggs parasitized decreased with the increasing age of the host eggs. Although there were similar numbers of fresh and 2 day old host eggs parasitized by wasps reared on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cephalonica</italic>, we notice that the rearing host distinctly influenced the wasp parasitic capacity and accurate identification for the age of host eggs. <italic>Trichogramma leucaniae</italic> reared on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> eggs not only parasitized more SPB eggs than the wasps reared on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>cephalonica</italic> but also had a stronger ability to recognize SPB eggs of different ages, which is beneficial for their offspring quality. This finding indicates that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> egg is a potential alternative host for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> mass production.</p><p>These results further confirmed previous studies that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> has an increased parasitic capacity and suitability [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and appears to be an effective augmentative biological control agent against SPB. <italic>Trichogramma leucaniae</italic> rearing based on large eggs of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pernyi</italic> make it possible to mass-produce and inundatively release them against SPB. In addition, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> can parasitize other lepidopteran pests that occur and cause damage simultaneously with SPB. Furthermore, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> also exhibited better parasitic capacity and suitability on <italic>Ascotis selenaria</italic> eggs, one of the most important defoliators of soybean than the other two <italic>Trichogramma</italic> species present in soybean fields [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, releasing <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> is not only effective for SPB control but also <italic>A selenaria</italic> and other pests, which exhibits that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> is an economic and effective biological control agent. However, to improve the efficacy of control, field application and release techniques based on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>leucaniae</italic> and SPB biological characteristics should be further studied in detail, as multiple factors could impact effectiveness of <italic>Trichogramma</italic> parasitoids [<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231098.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0231098.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>The data necessary to replicate the results alongside the manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0231098.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0231098.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zang</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ran</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>

After 12 h, a range of 60-100 host eggs deposited on the soybean pod will be obtained. For this experiment, we hardly prepare similar numbers of host eggs to a test parasitoid.

Please reconsider the sentence.</p><p>Answer: Based on the suggestion, we change the sentence to &#x02018;Trichogramma leucaniae could be reared on the large eggs of A. pernyi with divergent adaptation for 8 successive generations, showing that the biological traits of parasitoids can be changed through artificial domestication.&#x02019;</p><p>Line 259-260: &#x0201c;In our study&#x02026; for generations&#x0201d; It seems contradictory statement compared to the statement mentioned above in Line 249-251. Please reconsider what did you mean by this.</p><p>Answer: after the revision on Line 249-251, the statement of Line 259-260 will be rational.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0231098.s002"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.doc</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0231098.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0231098.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0231098.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Biondi</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Antonio Biondi</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Antonio Biondi</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0231098" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
