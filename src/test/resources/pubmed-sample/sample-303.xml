This problem is projected to increase as baby boomers age. Research confirms fall risk detection and evidence-based prevention programs offered in clinical and community settings that serve an aging population are effective at reducing the number of falls experienced (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To expand the reach of these services beyond the aging services network, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Administration for Community Living (ACL), and other funders are supporting opportunities for public health entities to become leaders in fall-prevention initiatives. The goal is to expand the infrastructure and entry points in both clinical and community settings to better meet the challenges of older adult fall risk management.</p><p>However, integrated community-clinical efforts integral to fall risk management are relatively new endeavors for State Departments of Health (DOH) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To be successful, DOH must recruit and engage a set of partners representing diverse sectors. Multi-sectorial collaborations are important for sustained adoption of evidence-based fall risk management practices. Such practices ensure the availability of a continuum of prevention and referral services for older adults.</p><p>This Commentary builds upon previous work from the State Falls Prevention Project (SFPP), a project funded by the CDC, in which DOH in New York, Colorado, and Oregon were charged with implementing clinical and community fall-prevention programs in specific geographic areas (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Now that the 5-year initiative has concluded, this Commentary reflects viewpoints of the SFPP Falls Evaluation and Technical Assistance (FETA) Team as guidance statements for future delivery of multi-level evidence-based fall-prevention interventions in the United States.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>State Falls Prevention Project</title><p>During the course of the SFPP, it became apparent the most effective implementation role for the DOH was to identify and connect health-care systems, community providers, and older adults to needed resources. Each DOH facilitated the implementation of three evidence-based fall-prevention programs, which were selected because of their ability to minimize risk of falling by improving balance, increasing strength, and providing education: (1) Tai Chi: moving for better balance; (2) stepping on; and (3) the Otago Exercise Program. Each state also developed strategies to increase clinical engagement in fall risk management through use of the CDC STEADI (STopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injuries) tool kit. Through this process, each DOH faced similar implementation challenges, which generated better appreciation of lessons learned from this experience and effective solutions.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Challenges</title><p>During the first pilot year, the DOHs deployed the strategy of: (1) engaging with health-care providers through a traditional academic detailing model (i.e., provide lunch and a brief training session) to facilitate adoption of evidence-based fall risk management practices (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and (2) working with community providers to increase access to community evidence-based fall-prevention programs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Several challenges were quickly realized by the entire SFFP team including:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Changing physician practice is a monumental task requiring the development of meaningful value propositions for each practice and ongoing relationship building, which could not be accomplished with a brief &#x0201c;lunch and learn&#x0201d; session.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Health-care organizations and providers (e.g., physicians, nurses, and physical therapists) typically have limited knowledge about value and availability of evidence-based fall-prevention programs available in the community.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There are many competing health-care and clinic efficiency initiatives that make it difficult for any new project to be viewed as a priority.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Each health-care system is unique. What motivates one system to embed fall risk management practices [i.e., modify Electronic Medical Records (EHR), adopt STEADI] will not necessarily be valued or motivating to other health-care systems in the same region.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is widespread dissemination of evidence-based programs; however, a lack of program availability exists in many communities; few communities have a central source to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date list of available programs; this makes it challenging to schedule a patient in a timely manner.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Referral systems are fractured. No internal systems exist within a health-care system to refer a patient to a community-based program. The converse was true &#x02013; no systems existed to connect an older adult identified as a fall risk by a community provider to a health-care provider.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is a supply&#x02013;demand dilemma &#x02013; it is a challenge to build referrals from clinics to community programs (demand) while at the same time insuring you have enough programs in the community (supply).</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is important to identify potential partners interested in decreasing health-care costs and achieving better outcomes. However, not all partners will be ready to implement evidence-based programs as a cost-reducing measure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Once a clinical-community linkage is created, long term sustainability of the linkage may be challenging due to personnel changes, program availability, and competing demands.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Solutions and Lessons Learned</title><p>Reflecting on these challenges, the SFPP FETA Team, in collaboration with funders and grantees, gained perspectives about effective solutions. The role of the DOH as a &#x0201c;connector and convener&#x0201d; seemed the most effective model. As connector, the DOH educated and engaged stakeholders from health care and community settings about respective roles in fall-prevention efforts. As convener, the DOH brought stakeholders together to identify problems, discuss feasible strategies and solutions, and create state-specific systems to advance fall prevention. This strategy ultimately created stakeholder buy-in and ownership while developing potentially sustainable solutions to these challenges (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
