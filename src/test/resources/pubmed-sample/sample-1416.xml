However, data collection and processing criteria, such as non-wear time rules might affect the assessment of total PA and sedentary time and the associations with health variables. The study aimed to investigate whether the choice of different non-wear time definitions would affect the outcomes of PA levels in youth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Seventy-seven healthy youngsters (44 boys), aged 10&#x02013;17&#x02009;years, wore an accelerometer and kept a non-wear log diary during 4 consecutives days. We compared 7 published algorithms (10, 15, 20, 30, 60&#x02009;min of continuous zeros, Choi, and Troiano algorithms).

By contrast, a sedentary lifestyle is associated with adverse health consequences such as obesity, lower aerobic fitness, poorer quality of life and self-esteem, depression, and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The accurate measurement of PA levels is essential for evaluating the relationships between PA and health outcomes in both epidemiological and interventional studies.</p><p id="Par10">The use of accelerometers has become the method of choice for objectively assessing PA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this method has some limitations for data collection and processing criteria decisions. One major concern is the validation of wear and non-wear time when the accelerometer is worn at the hip. Participants are usually instructed to remove the device during water-based activities (swimming, showering, and bathing) and overnight. This requires the use of a non-wear log diary to determine whether the participant has worn the device during a sedentary activity or removed the device (and therefore PA would be missed), but this is a cumbersome procedure that can create barriers in large population studies.</p><p id="Par11">To solve this issue, two methodologies have been used. Firstly, researchers can to perform their assessment using wrist-worn accelerometers. Indeed, wrist-worn accelerometers, compared to waist-worn monitors, may be more convenient and comfortable and improve compliance in studies where there is prolonged wear time (usually 7&#x02009;day to assess habitual physical activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As second possibility, algorithms have been proposed to consider the treatment of consecutive zeros recorded by the accelerometer as an indicator of non-wear times when participant wear at hip. Several cutoffs are used as an indicator of a non-wearing period, such as 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60&#x02009;min of continuous zeros [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other algorithms that consider additional parameters have been also proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the use of these algorithms carries a risk of falsely classifying a true sedentary period as a non-wear period, and the choice of the best algorithm remains a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Few studies have addressed this question in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These studies showed clearly that the choice of wear time algorithms may introduce significant errors in PA levels assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a review, Esliger et al. suggested to use 20&#x02009;min of consecutive zero counts as criterion in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This conclusion concurs with another study performed in 369,517 children aged 8&#x02013;13&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Authors compared three non-wear time algorithms (10, 20 and 60&#x02009;min of consecutives zero counts) with a data reduction log [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and found that 20&#x02009;min is the more appropriate. Chinapaw et al. suggested that the 20&#x02009;min algorithm was to low and recommended a minimum of 60&#x02009;min of consecutive zeros as the most realistic criterion for non-wear time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Based on 268 children aged 7&#x02013;11&#x02009;years, Banda et al. compared other algorithms (20&#x02009;min, Choi and Troiano algorithms) and showed also a significant error in PA assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, authors compared different non-wear time definitions without a non-wear log diary. Therefore, authors could not recommend the better algorithm for data processing reduction. Recently, a study compared 10 algorithms with a logbook in children aged 10&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Authors concluded a 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;min criterion being used in future studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, in this study, no specific time points for wear and non-wear were provided in the logbook that could lead to an error in the ability to identify the better algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Indeed, to be more precise and for determining the exact agreement for each period as wear and non-wear and the accelerometer files, only a comparison with total wear time is not enough robust. Using data from the diary with specific time points for wear and non-wear would provide a better basis for evaluating the performance of the non-wear time criteria and would provide new knowledge in the field. These conflicting results between all these studies lead confusion for researchers and practitioners who have to make better decisions in their data collection using accelerometer, in order to obtain more valid and comparable data.</p><p id="Par12">Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the choice of different non-wear time definitions would affect the measurement of PA levels in children and adolescents. The final aim of this study was to identify the best algorithm for assessing non-wear time using a log diary as the reference method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par13">Eighty healthy children and adolescents participated in this study.

Our study clearly shows that wear time can vary widely according to the algorithm used and that this variability significantly affects the assessment of sedentary activity but not MVPA. Therefore, defining the most accurate method for assessing non-wear time is needed to standardize PA measurement using accelerometry in youth.</p><p id="Par32">One main result of our study was that the cutoff for non-wear time of an algorithm strongly affects the assessment of the sedentary activity duration.

Janssen et al. found a difference of 17% in the mean daily sedentary time using 10 and 60&#x02009;min rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Two others studies in children demonstrated also that time spent in sedentary activity varied significantly according to wear time algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, because authors compared different non-wear time definitions without a non wear log diary, their reported analyses were insufficiently consistent to be able to identify a better algorithm for data processing reduction for assessing sedentary behaviors. Recently, a study compared 10 algorithms with a logbook in children and authors encouraged to use a 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;min criterion being used in future pediatric studies for assessing sedentary time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In our study, 3 algorithms (Choi, Troiano, and 60&#x02009;min of continuous zeros) significantly overestimated the time spent in sedentary activities and 3 others algorithms (10, 15, and 20&#x02009;min of continuous zeros) significantly underestimated the time spent in sedentary activities. The best agreement was found using the criterion of 30&#x02009;min of continuous zeros, which differed by only 1% difference from the log diary. Methodological issues might explain the discrepancy we found in the present study. In our study, we used specific time points for wear and non-wear provided in the diary. Our dataset allows for determining the exact agreement for each period as wear and non-wear from the diary and the accelerometer files, not only a comparison of total wear time in the Aadland et al&#x02019;s study. The wide range of ages used in our study may also explain the difference. We analysed data from children and adolescents while Aadland et al. were included only children.</p><p id="Par33">The number of non-wear periods according to log diary ranged 0 to 3 periods per day. Our results are in agreement with those found by Aadland et al. where authors reported 0&#x02013;3 non wear periods per day using a log [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

This conclusion concurs with our current findings showing the best agreement between log diary and assessment of the sedentary activity duration for the criterion of 30&#x02009;min of continuous zeros (Kappa coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17; 0&#x02013;5 non-wear periods per day). While our study found a maximum of 3 non-wear periods for the 30&#x02009;min non-wear algorithm, previous studies have found a maximum number of 5&#x02013;7 periods for this algorithm, which supports the choice of a longer non-wear criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

In our study, the age range was more large (10&#x02013;17&#x02009;years) compared with previous studies (9&#x02013;14&#x02009;years). The difference in our results might be due also of a smaller sample (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;77) compared to the previous studies having around 1000 participants. Then, sociodemographic characteristics and the length of assessment period (4&#x02009;days vs 7&#x02009;days) could also contribute in these conflicting results. Further studies are needed to analyze these differences in order to suggest the best algorithm for children and adolescent.</p><p id="Par34">Another main result of our study was that the choice of algorithm had no significant effect on MVPA assessment and the percentage of participants meeting the PA recommendations. Only 1 study has examined this outcome in adults and it also found no significant difference in the percentage of participants classified as meeting the PA recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the study performed in children by Aadland et al., authors found no difference in time spent in MVPA between algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, we can extrapolate that the number of children that achieved the guideline amount of MVPA according algorithms is obviously similar. Results from these studies show clearly that the choice of wear time algorithms do not impact in the MVPA assessment.</p><p id="Par35">According to consensus recommendations for assessing PA in youth with accelerometers, a minimum of 10&#x02009;h of wearing time is needed to consider the day as valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The algorithm comparisons in our study show that the choice of algorithm may significantly affect the duration of wear time and the choice whether to consider a recording day as a valid day. As for sedentary time assessment, the same algorithms under- or overestimated the wear time duration, expect the algorithm with 20&#x02009;min or 30&#x02009;min of continuous zeros. Using longer non-wear definitions (such as the Troiano and Choi algorithms or 60&#x02009;min) resulted in overestimation of the wear time compared with the log diary. Our data differ from those of previous studies in older adults, in which longer non-wear definitions (i.e., at least 60&#x02009;min) provided the closest approximation of self-reported wear time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Using the results of our study, we recommend the use of the algorithm with 30&#x02009;min of continuous zeros for defining non-wear time for PA when using accelerometers in children and adolescents. This recommendation disagrees with that for adults and children; thresholds of 60&#x02009;min and 20&#x02009;min of consecutive zeros for adults and children are recommended to avoid the risk of misclassification of non-wear time as sedentary time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The decline in PA with age is a possible explanation for the difference with our results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Adults and older adults spend more time in sedentary activities than do children and adolescents. Therefore, using a too-short non-wear algorithm may increase the risk of misclassifying sedentary time as non-wear time in adults. Conversely, children spend less time in sedentary activities than adolescents. Indeed, authors showed significant differences in sedentary time between the different non wear rules from childhood to adolescence. Compared to the manual rule, at age 9&#x02009;years, the 10&#x02009;min zero string non wear rule resulted in the closest estimates of sedentary time while at age 12&#x02009;years, the 20&#x02009;min and 60&#x02009;min zero-string rule are better, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our recommendation is also support when we compared the mean of the number of non-wear periods between log diary method and different non-wear time criteria. Our finding suggests that use the algorithm of 30&#x02009;min seems to be more adequate.</p><p id="Par37">The current study has strengths and limitations. The main strength of the study is the use of a log diary as the basis for comparison of different non-wear times; this provides confidence in our findings. One limitation is the precision in the data recording in the log diary. However, participants used a specific watch that had been synchronized with the accelerometer to improve the accuracy of the assessment of non-wear-time. In addition, inclusion criterion was compliance of participants in completing this log diary. Even if several authors reported a bias in PA assessment with log diary in youth, our results are robust because the primary objective of our study was to use the log diary for assessing non-wear time and not their PA levels. A second limitation is our study is that it involved only healthy volunteers who were relatively active, which limits our results to this population. Overweight and obese adolescents spend more time in sedentary activities compared with their lean counterparts, which may increase the risk of misclassifying sedentary time as non-wear time in overweight and obese youths. Further studies should include a more heterogeneous population to confirm and extend our findings. The wide range of ages (10&#x02013;17&#x02009;years) used in our study may also have an impact on our results. Adolescents spending more time in sedentary activities compared to children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we cannot therefore also to exclude a risk of misclassifying sedentary time as non-wear in adolescent. Our sample size is too small to perform analyses according to age. Future studies should categorize analyses with age as a primary focus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">Although the concordance was good for most algorithms, the choice of different non-wear time definitions may affect the quantification of the time and PA intensity levels measured, especially sedentary time, using triaxial accelerometry in children and adolescents. Our study highlights the importance of choosing the appropriate processing criteria for assessing PA by accelerometry. Based on our results, we suggest that studies performed in children and adolescents use the algorithm of 30&#x02009;min of continuous zeros to assess the PA levels and wear time. However, further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
