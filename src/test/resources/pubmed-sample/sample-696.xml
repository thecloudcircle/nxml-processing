To elucidate how p53RE sequences and local chromatin context interact to affect p53 binding and gene transactivation, we mapped genome-wide binding localizations of p53 and H3K4me3 in untreated and doxorubicin (DXR)-treated human lymphoblastoid cells. We examined the relationships among p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3K4me3, chromatin accessibility (DNase 1 hypersensitivity, DHS), ENCODE chromatin states, p53RE sequence, and evolutionary conservation. We observed that the inducible expression of p53-regulated genes was associated with the steady-state chromatin status of the cell. Most highly inducible p53-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or displayed CTCF binding. Comparison of p53RE sequences residing in different chromatin contexts demonstrated that weaker p53REs resided in open promoters, while stronger p53REs were located within enhancers and repressed chromatin. p53 occupancy was strongly correlated with similarity of the target DNA sequences to the p53RE consensus, but surprisingly, inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility (DHS) and evolutionary conservation at the p53RE. Occupancy by p53 of REs that overlapped transposable element (TE) repeats was significantly higher (p&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>) and correlated with stronger p53RE sequences (p&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;110</sup>) relative to nonTE-associated p53REs, particularly for MLT1H, LTR10B, and Mer61 TEs. However, binding at these elements was generally not associated with transactivation of adjacent genes. Occupied p53REs located in L2-like TEs were unique in displaying highly negative PhyloP scores (predicted fast-evolving) and being associated with altered H3K4me3 and DHS levels. These results underscore the systematic interaction between chromatin status and p53RE context in the induced transactivation response. This p53 regulated response appears to have been tuned via evolutionary processes that may have led to repression and/or utilization of p53REs originating from primate-specific transposon elements.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>It is well established that p53 binds DNA elements near p53 target genes to regulate the response to cellular stress. To assess factors influencing binding to response elements and subsequent gene expression, we have analyzed 2932 p53-occupied response elements (p53REs) in the context of genome-wide chromatin state, DNA accessibility and dynamics, and considered roles for binding-sequence specificity and evolutionary conservation. While p53 occupancy level shows little apparent direct relationship to gene expression change, after grouping expressed genes by their chromatin status at baseline, a relationship between occupancy of p53REs and gene expression change emerged. Analysis of p53RE sequences demonstrated that p53 occupancy was strongly correlated with sequence similarity to p53RE consensus, but surprisingly, was inversely correlated with nucleosome accessibility (DHS) and evolutionary conservation. These data revealed a systematic interaction between p53RE content and chromatin context that affects both quantitative p53 occupancy and the induced transactivation response to exposure. Moreover, this interaction appears to have been tuned via evolutionary events involving transposable elements, which strongly bind p53, but in only a few instances affect gene expression levels. Models of p53-regulated gene expression response that consider both chromatin state and sequence context may prove useful in guiding strategies for cancer prevention or therapy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Intramural Research Program of National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences-National Institutes of Health, ZO1ES100475 to DAB.

Understanding the regulatory logic of p53 is critical to understanding p53 biology in normal and tumor cells. The canonical p53 responsive element (p53RE) is composed of two decamers of RRRCWWGYYY, where R &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; purine, W &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; A or T and Y &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; pyrimidine, separated by a spacer of 0&#x02013;21 nucleotides (nt), leading to millions of putative p53RE sites in the human genome <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Riley1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. About two hundred p53REs have been characterized in detail but p53 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments indicate there are thousands of p53 targets and numerous exposure-specific patterns of binding and transactivation <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004885-Menendez1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These patterns have been variously attributed to sequence-specific binding <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Smeenk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, p53 post-translational modifications <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Smeenk2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, targeting coactivators/factors <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Andrysik1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, post-transcriptional effects <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, as well as, chromatin status at the binding site <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004885-Millau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, the rules governing the sequence specificity and functional output of regulatory interactions between p53 and the genome are not yet fully understood.</p><p>A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have clearly demonstrated that p53RE sequence variation, including polymorphisms and spacer length, affect p53 binding to DNA and subsequent transcriptional activation <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Bandele1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004885-Veprintsev1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These studies show that p53REs with higher similarity to the p53RE consensus display stronger binding and those that contain spacer sequences larger than 1 nt between the decamers show dramatically reduced binding. These studies, however, did not consider the impact of the varied genomic chromatin contexts on p53 binding to response elements and evolutionary conservation of p53REs. In addition, p53 binding motifs occur frequently in primate-specific interspersed repeats, including retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>), short (SINE <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Zemojtel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, such as Alu), and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). Considering the potential role of transposition in the evolution of cis-regulatory elements <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we ask if these recently evolved p53 binding sites have acquired sequence properties or chromatin contexts which might indicate if they are functionally suppressed or utilized.</p><p>Chromatin accessibility can be a primary determinant of transcription factor (TF) occupancy <xref rid="pgen.1004885-John1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Guertin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. For example, ligand-activated glucocorticoid receptor binding occurred with near absolute preference (&#x0223c;95%) for binding sites located in accessible chromatin <xref rid="pgen.1004885-John1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and recent Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Project (ENCODE) reports <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Thurman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> have supported this phenomenon for numerous other TFs. In contrast, Nili et. al. <xref rid="pgen.1004885-LidorNili1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> described a different situation for the tumor suppressor protein p53, demonstrating that in the tumor cell line MCF7, p53 often binds genomic regions that have high existing nucleosome density and low chromatin accessibility. Other studies have suggested that stress-induced binding at specific <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (p21) p53REs is associated with chromatin structure at these locations <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Millau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These observations argue for further exploration of the role of chromatin-accessibility in regulating p53 access to DNA regulatory elements. Specific chromatin modifications at histone proteins correlate with TF binding, transcription initiation, elongation, enhancer activity and repression <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Hon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To elucidate how p53 RE sequences and local chromatin context interact to affect p53 binding and gene transactivation, we have taken advantage of a well-characterized lymphoblastoid cell-culture exposure model system <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Smirnov1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004885-Dunham1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The ENCODE project has generated Hidden Markov models (HMM) <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Dunham1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Ernst1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> that annotate the human genome into distinct (15 or 7 HMM states) chromatin states. These models are based on combinatorial patterns of eight informative histone modification marks, Zinc finger CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the presence of DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) and the spatial relationships with gene transcription across nine cell types. The ENCODE ChromHMM model describes the chromatin landscape in unstressed cells and highlights transcriptional regulatory elements reliably and robustly <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Dunham1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Ram1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We have integrated these ENCODE data sets into our experimental data with the aim of deconvoluting the roles for chromatin context/state, p53RE sequence, and p53 occupancy in the transactivation of p53 target genes.</p><p>Thus, in the present study we have examined genome-wide changes in p53 binding (ChIP-seq), H3K4me3 (ChIP-seq), gene expression, and DNase I hypersensitivity (DNase-seq) that were induced by the DNA-damaging, chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DXR) in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). The goal was to assess these changes in the context of ENCODE chromatin states, and consider the role of p53RE sequence content and evolutionary conservation. We revealed several unique relationships, including inverse correlations between p53 occupancy and both chromatin accessibility and evolutionary conservation. Notably, our novel, integrated genome-wide analysis demonstrated that p53RE sequence content is highly correlated with genomic occupancy, and that chromatin state context strongly modulates the relationship between p53 occupancy level and changes in gene expression. Furthermore, the interaction between these features appears to have been shaped by evolutionary selective pressure, likely driven by transposable elements. Our study sheds new light on the complex interrelationship between chromatin state and p53RE sequence in p53 genomic occupancy, and suggests the importance of considering the interactions of sequence content and epigenetic factors in interpreting p53-mediated stress responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Identification of genomic p53 binding sites and target genes in human lymphoblastoid cells</title><p>We carried out p53 activating treatments in LCLs (GM06993, GM11992, and GM12878) using a 0.3 &#x000b5;g/mL dose of DXR and prepared mRNA samples at 4 and 18 hrs of treatment.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, the ChromHMM7 track (G) summarizes the chromatin characteristics of this region of the genome. For example, the red box highlights the promoter region of the p53 inducible gene, <italic>PGPEP1</italic>. Numerous histone modifications and DHS align at this position, and the ChromHMM7 track displays red indicative of an active promoter (State 1). In the same genomic region within the orange box where p53 peaks were detected, the ChromHMM track displays a strong DHS peak and multiple histone modifications (tracks J) particularly H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 indicative of an active, distal enhancer. We used the ChromHMM7 Combined model (ENCODE website) to classify p53 occupied regions and genes as: 1) active promoter (e.g., <italic>PGPEP1</italic>, active histone marks present: H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K9ac at&#x0003e;93% frequency); 2) promoter flanking region; 3) enhancer (H3K4me1 at&#x0003e;96% frequency); 4) weak enhancer/open chromatin; 5) insulator CTCF enriched; 6) transcribed; 7) repressed, including polycomb and heterochromatin.

We examined these phenomena across all p53 occupied genes. Of the 2932 DXR-induced p53-occupied regions, 1697 genes had detectable gene expression levels using the Affymetrix Exon Array 1.0 either under no treatment (NT) conditions or after treatment. We grouped expression values into deciles based on baseline H3K4me3 levels at TSS (ordered from low to high, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), we observed a very striking, linear relationship over time (NT, 4 hr, 18 hr after DXR treatment). Expression values for untreated cells (black bars) display a strong linear trend for increasing mean gene expression values with increasing H3K4me3 decile. Following DXR treatment (open bar &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 4 hr, gray bar &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 18 hr), the group of genes with low initial H3K4me3 levels (deciles D1&#x02013;D3, left side of graph) show the largest change in expression. Thus highly inducible p53-regulated genes typically do not display activating H3K4me3 marks in unstressed cells. We performed regression analysis on the DXR-induced change in H3K4me3 modification with the DXR-induced change in gene expression which showed a significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.41, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

While most binding in active promoters was proximal to transcription start sites (TSS), it is notable that 42% of binding locations (those in enhancers, CTCF regions, transcribed regions) have median distances that are at least 32 Kb distal from a TSS, and many binding sites located in repressed regions are much further from a TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Thus the relationship between PWM and ChIP-seq peak density that we observed previously among all p53 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), holds among families of repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s008">S8D Fig</xref>.). If these peaks were functionally associated with nearby genes we would expect treatment-induced changes in H3K4me3 peak density at the TSS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g008">Fig. 8F</xref> shows that genes nearby TE-associated p53REs display less average H3K4me3 changes than nonTE-associated genes.

Strikingly, when we stratify the 1697 genes that display mRNA expression by the ChromHMM state at their TSS, we observe a linear trend between patterns of quantitative p53 occupancy (peak density) and fold change gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Based on single-gene experimental models of p53 occupancy and transactivation, this relationship is not unexpected, but the clarity achieved by considering chromatin state on a genome-wide scale is dramatic (comparing <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s004">S4C Fig</xref>. with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, chromatin state models created under steady-state conditions, such as the ENCODE ChromHMM, were highly predictive of genome-wide p53-mediated responses, and can help elucidate the mechanisms that enable those responses.

We asked if p53 binding sequences located in different chromatin functional regions might display characteristic differences, and we observed that among the 592 peaks occurring in active promoters, the most prominent motif closely matched the p53 consensus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s005">S5B Fig</xref>., p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;63</sup>).

However, these p53-related CTCF motifs were not associated with the CTCF insulator function as these regions displayed high nucleosome accessibility and the genes had high average expression levels.

DXR induced changes in DHS that co-locate precisely with CTCF binding in untreated cells are consistent with this notion. Akdemir et. al. <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Akdemir1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> proposed that changes in H3K27me3 status at poised genes via a mechanism of p53-JMJD3/UTX interaction could drive the conversion of poised genes to actively expressed genes. However, in the present experiment, the expression of these chromatin remodeling factors were not detectable. We did observe that changes in H3K4me3 were strongly confluent with altered DHS patterns and consistent with transcriptional activation of some poised p53 genes like <italic>SULF2</italic> following treatment. The detailed mechanism drives the release of these specific genes from their poised state is an area of future study. Down-regulated genes had quite different characteristics; most down-regulated genes (85%) had open promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>) and displayed high expression at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s002">S2A Fig</xref>.). Interestingly, both the density of p53 binding, and the calculated p53RE PWM score associated with down-regulated genes were significantly lower compared with p53REs from induced genes (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Nikulenkov et. al. <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Nikulenkov1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> observed a similar lower peak density among down-regulated genes. Wang et. al. <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> analyzed a small number of p53REs and suggested there was a preferred motif for down-regulated genes that is different from up-regulated genes. We also detected differences in the most enriched motif between the two groups of sequences. Specifically at nucleotides 10 and 11 in the p53RE motif, &#x0201c;TG&#x0201d; was present in the up-regulated REs and a &#x0201c;CA&#x0201d; motif occurred in the down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Consistent with this altered motif, the p53REs in down-regulated genes have a weaker match with the canonical sequence and lower mean PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, this change is unlikely to be a general feature of p53REs because among all chromatin states many up-regulated genes contain the &#x0201c;CA&#x0201d; motif at nucleotides 10, 11. Pathway and functional analysis of each chromatin state by DAVID analysis showed that p53 is the most likely regulator of these genes and that the most significant GO terms include &#x0201c;regulation of cell death&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;response to DNA damage stimulus&#x0201d;.</p><p>The relative importance of DNA sequence content and chromatin landscape in determining a transcription factor's genomic binding has been subjected to considerable experimental exploration <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Thurman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Dunham2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004885-PiqueRegi1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, including several with p53 <xref rid="pgen.1004885-LidorNili1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004885-Bandele1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.

Notably, at the level of individual binding sites (e.g., upstream of <italic>TGFA</italic>), high levels of p53 occupancy can occur with minimal local displacement of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g004">Figs. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s003">S3</xref>; as detected by DHS-seq). However, for poised genes marked with both H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g004">Fig. 4A&#x02013;C</xref>), p53 occupancy was associated with nucleosome accessibility changes at the TSS, but not necessarily at the p53 binding site. In these cases, as gene expression was induced, we observed the open DHS region spreading from the TSS, and the DHS pattern resembles the DXR-induced H3K4me3 pattern.</p><p>A particularly notable result is the relationship between quantitative occupancy and binding strength of the p53RE sequence relative to consensus. Modeling p53RE binding strength using a statistical approach (PWM), or with an experimental binding-based model (binding PWM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s006">S6A Fig</xref>.), we observed genome-wide correlations between binding strength and occupancy (peak density). This relationship was further validated using p53 ChIP-seq data generated from a different laboratory using a different cell type and treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s007">S7A&#x02013;C Fig</xref>.). Thus, p53RE sequence content strongly affects occupancy which is in agreement with several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that reported single nucleotide changes in the p53RE sequence or the spacer length alter p53 binding, transactivation of constructs or gene expression <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Bandele1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Veprintsev1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Jordan2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Recently a single nucleotide variation in a p53RE in the <italic>KITLG</italic> gene was demonstrated to alter p53 binding, transactivation of <italic>KITLG</italic> and be strongly associated with cancer <xref rid="pgen.1004885-ZeronMedina1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. However, our present study is the first genome-wide study to demonstrate the quantitative relationship between sequence content and genome-wide occupancy levels.</p><p>Surprisingly, p53RE PWM scores and occupancy were strongly negatively associated with chromatin accessibility and evolutionary conservation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g007">Figs. 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004885-g008">8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s007">S7C</xref>) at the binding site. That is, more conserved, relatively weak p53REs were observed to be found in accessible chromatin regions. Conversely, many strong p53REs with low conservation scores were located in heterochromatic regions with very low DHS. The p53REs located within enhancers displayed relatively high levels of conservation, PWM score, occupancy and accessibility. The contrast in levels of conservation and chromatin accessibility among p53REs is driven by the presence of primate-specific repeat elements of viral transposon origin that are characterized by low conservation, high PWM, high occupancy but low accessibility. This high occupancy, low accessibility and minimal nucleosome displacement observation is consistent with the Cui et. al <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> hypothesis that p53REs are accessible on the external surface of nucleosomes. Cui et. al. described this for Alu-associated p53REs; however, our data suggests that it may be a general feature of p53-occupied REs in heterochromatin, particularly those in retroviral-associated TEs (e.g. MLT, LTR, MER). Over many millions of years of evolution transposable elements have rearranged primate genomes <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Giordano1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and the presence of a multitude of p53 binding sites in various TEs <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004885-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> likely is related to an evolutionary mechanism for creating p53REs from TE sequences. Our present study uniquely reveals the interrelationships between TEs, p53RE sequence content, occupancy, and chromatin state.</p><p>There are several interesting and important questions concerning the functional nature of these TE-associated p53REs. Are these TEs actively suppressed (as a genome defense) and can they be reactivated in tumors or in normal cells following genomic stress like DNA damage? Leonova et. al. suggest that TEs are epigenetically suppressed and p53 is involved in transcriptional silencing of them <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Leonova1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. We observed that TE-associated p53REs were significantly stronger REs and were more highly occupied than non-repeat p53REs; however, most reside in repressive, closed chromatin. In addition, this occupancy did not typically translate into induced H3K4me3 levels at nearby gene TSSs or changes in gene expression. This would be consistent with suppression of these TE-associated p53REs by p53 binding. Also, one may ask, what are the characteristics of p53REs located in TEs that would allow them to be co-opted (exaptation) and used to regulate the expression of nearby genes <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Micale1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Huda1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>? It is unknown which features of chromatin or changes in chromatin structure might facilitate the utilization or exaptation of transposon-derived p53REs (e.g., domestication of transposons). While this question cannot be easily answered with the present data, it is intriguing that we observe some p53REs that overlap with TE-repeats (Alu and L2) display strongly negative PhyloP values suggesting the possibility of recent evolutionary selection <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Pollard1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In addition, if we consider that p53 occupancy of TE-associated p53REs is sometimes accompanied by altered DHS, H3K4me3 or gene expression at nearby genes (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004885.s009">S9 Fig</xref>.), it seems likely that many of them are functionally utilized.</p><p>Thus it is possible that both suppression and exaptation have occurred with many strong, newly-evolved TE-associated p53REs being actively suppressed via chromatin state but a small number of them are exapted and brought into the p53 regulatory network for use under stress conditions. These observations imply a potential functional link between the variation in genomic p53RE sequence, chromatin state and gene regulation, which has co-evolved over time. As pointed out by Leonova et. al. <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Leonova1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, characterizing the p53-mediated deregulation of transposable elements in tumors could be useful in clinical cancer diagnoses. Understanding how all of these variables interact and impact the p53-regulated response to DNA damage in primary and tumor cells will be important both for developing strategies for prevention of cancer in healthy individuals and for understanding outcomes in cytotoxic therapy for cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HapMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) CEU human lymphoblastoid cell lines GM06993, GM11992, and GM12878 (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and 1X antibiotics/antimycotics (Life Technologies).

Next the PWM score for any putative p53RE was calculated by summing the individual matrix values that correspond to the observed nucleotide at each position in that site. The potential p53REs in a genomic sequence were detected by sliding a window along the input sequence, considering the spacer in p53REs <xref rid="pgen.1004885-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Briefly, at each chromosomal position, PWM score calculations were performed on DNA sequences with 20&#x02013;23 nucleotides, corresponding to p53REs with a spacer of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For DNA sequences longer than 20, the first 10 nucleotides and the last 10 nucleotides were concatenated first to make a sequence of 20 nucleotides. For fast searching, a pattern composed of at least 3 of 4 core C and G nucleotides in the p53RE consensus was applied before PWM calculation. In addition, the same calculations were performed on the reversed complimentary sequences. In total, at each chromosomal position, eight calculations were performed. At a given location a putative p53RE was reported based on the following three criteria: (i) the sequence matches the search pattern; and (ii) the PWM score is above the PWM score threshold; and (iii) it contains the shortest spacer and has the largest PWM score.
