The mating preference of recombinant strains was then tested by giving virgin recombinant individuals a choice of mates with X-islands matching and non-matching their own island type. We show through genetic analyses of transferred sperm that recombinant females consistently mated with matching island-type males thereby associating assortative mating genes with the X-island of divergence. Furthermore, full-genome sequencing confirmed that protein-coding differences between recombinant strains were limited to the experimentally swapped pericentromeric region. Finally, targeted-genome comparisons showed that a number of these unique differences were conserved in sympatric field populations, thereby revealing candidate speciation genes. The functional demonstration of a close association between speciation genes and the X-island of differentiation lends unprecedented support to island-of-speciation models of sympatric speciation facilitated by pericentric recombination suppression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>
<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> is the most important vector of malaria in Africa. This species is undergoing speciation and a number of subpopulations have been identified which can produce viable hybrid offspring but are reproductively isolated through assortative mating and ecological adaptation. This complex structure provides an ideal system for studying the unique genetic and behavioural processes required for speciation. <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>&#x02019;s subpopulations differ genetically in limited regions of their genomes called islands of speciation. Theoretical studies predict that these islands, characterized by restricted genetic rearrangements, may protect genes of assortative mating between emerging species, and are fundamental to the speciation process. We set out to test this prediction by performing complex genetic crosses between the sister species <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae s</italic>.<italic>s</italic>. and creating recombinant strains differing only at their X-chromosome island of speciation. We show through behavioural studies that recombinant females consistently mated with matching island-type males thereby associating assortative mating genes with the X-island of divergence. By sequencing the genetic code of the recombinant strains and natural populations, we could confirm these findings and identify candidate assortative mating genes. These findings suggest an important role of divergence islands for the genetic and behavioural processes associated with speciation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Programme Grant (#041085) to FT (co-PI), a UK Natural Environment Research Council MGF Small Project Grant to FT (#484), a joint UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) Africa Research Leader grant to AD and FT (#97014), and scholarships from the High Commission of Ghana to FAA, from the Syrian Ministry of Education to NH, from the Nigerian Tertiary Education Trust Fund to NEE, and from the Saudi Ministry of Higher Education to RB.

At the core of this interest is the search for distinct genomic signatures that can help us understand what is thought to be a relatively narrow and unlikely set of genetic and ecological conditions facilitating the emergence and divergence of two gene pools from an originally panmictic population. For sympatric speciation with gene flow to occur, divergent selection acting on locally adapted genes has to overcome the homogenizing effects of migration and recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Theoretical models of sympatric speciation have long recognised that this can only occur under a restricted set of conditions in which the genomic architecture often plays a major role [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Features of the genome such as chromosomal inversions and peri-centromeric regions that suppress recombination and link together genes of pre-mating isolation and ecological adaptation genes are predicted to facilitate sympatric speciation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, hemizygosity and lower recombination rates are thought to predispose sex chromosomes to the more rapid accumulation of genes of pre and post-mating isolation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>These general predictions have found empirical support from a limited number of studies designed to map genes involved in speciation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and/or to detect loci under divergent selection across genomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Currently this evidence concerns almost exclusively species already separated by both pre-zygotic and intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive isolation in which teasing out the genomic signature of the onset of speciation from the genomic processes that follow post-mating reproductive isolation constitutes a major challenge [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> complex comprises the main vector species responsible for malaria transmission. It is also a species complex rich in cryptic taxa separated by various degrees of reproductive isolation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and could provide the ideal system for studying the genomic signature of pre-mating isolation independent of intrinsic isolation processes. The sibling species <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> and <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae s</italic>.<italic>s</italic>. were until recently known as the 'M and S' molecular forms of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> in reference to diagnostic genetic differences in the ribosomal DNA regions [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These incipient species co-occur over large areas of West Africa and do not exhibit intrinsic post-mating barriers to reproduction [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Across much of their sympatric range their integrity is maintained by strong assortative mating [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] resulting in rare hybrids and low levels of genetic introgression between the two taxa [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, in the Western coastal countries of Guinea Bissau and Senegal hybrids can occur locally at much higher frequencies [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], resulting in a large hybrid zone between the incipient sibling species and high levels of genetic introgression [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Divergence between these species is thought to be driven by larval adaptation to different types of bodies of water [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Transplant experiments have shown that <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> larvae survive better than those of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. in habitats that are more permanent and rich in aquatic predators while the reverse is true in predator-free temporary water bodies [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Adults of both species have similar feeding and resting habits and mate in swarms at dusk in villages. Swarm site segregation is thought to contribute to assortative mating [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but the occurrence of mixed swarms at various frequencies [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] points towards additional conspecific recognition mechanisms, possibly based on flight tones [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Several groundbreaking studies have shown that sympatric speciation in these two incipient species probably involved the divergence of a few &#x02018;islands of divergence' that possibly contain clusters of speciation genes and located in areas of low recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These putative 'islands of speciation' include 3 pericentromeric islands of divergence located on the X, 2L and 3L chromosomes as well as smaller islands located in the vicinity of inversion breakpoints [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Perfect linkage disequilibrium between the X, 2L and 3L islands was found in samples from sympatric populations of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> and <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. from central West Africa [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This pattern suggested very low gene flow between the sibling species and the possibility that pericentromeric islands of divergence were merely 'incidental rather than instrumental' to the speciation process [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Subsequent genomic studies reinforced this view, suggesting divergence at many other loci across the genome and a more advanced stage of sympatric speciation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, recent studies have shown that the linkage disequilibrium between the pericentromeric islands breaks down to various degrees in areas with higher introgression between the sibling species [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Taken together the comparative genomics data would therefore support a model of genomic divergence in which pericentromeric divergence islands could play a major role in speciation in the face of varying levels of gene flow [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Since this view is currently subject to debate and because there are limits to the inferences that can be drawn from comparative genomics studies, we set out to demonstrate the role of divergence islands in the sympatric speciation process using an experimental functional genomics approach. We hypothesized that the largest putative 'speciation island' of the X chromosome would be a prime candidate for protecting assortative mating and ecological adaptation genes in the face of ongoing gene flow because it combines pericentromeric recombination suppression with the hemizygosity and decreased recombination typically associated with the X chromosome. Next, we selectively introgressed the S-form X-linked island of divergence of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. into an. <italic>coluzzii</italic> genetic background to create recombinant strains that shared an <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> genetic background but differed at their X-chromosome islands of speciation. Standardised assortative mating experiments were then used to test the potential association of the X-island molecular type with the mating preferences of recombinant and parental strains. These were combined with full-genome strain comparisons as well as targeted genome sequencing from sympatric populations. This strategy enabled us to identify the size of the pericentromeric region introgressed from <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. into the <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> background, fixed protein-coding differences distinguishing recombinant strains, and conserved differences putatively relevant to speciation.</p><p>The results demonstrate the close association of assortative-mating genes with the X-island of speciation and thus lend support to models of speciation involving pericentric recombination suppression in these sympatric incipient species. In addition, the development of a laboratory-based model-system for studying assortative mating is an important step towards the description of key reproductive isolation genes and mechanisms responsible for pre-mating isolation among these cryptic taxa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>Recombinant strains with M or S-form X-island molecular type were produced by selectively introgressing the X-island from the S form Kisumu strain of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. into the M form Mopti strain of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> for 4 generations, followed by two generations of crosses within the introgressed strain that resulted in <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic>-like recombinant strains, one fixed for the M-type X-island (RbMM strain), and one with the S-type X-island (RbSS strain).

Albeit demonstrated here using laboratory recombinant strains, the close association observed between pre-mating isolation genes and the X-island supports the hypothesis that pericentric regions can create linkage disequilibrium (LD) and thus protect associations between genes of pre-mating isolation and ecological adaptation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and facilitate the onset of sympatric speciation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The results are consistent with the notion that hemizygosity and the lower recombination rates of sex chromosomes predispose them to accumulating genes of pre and post-mating isolation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the case of the X-island of speciation, the pericentric and X-chromosome recombination suppression effects synergise, thereby further reducing recombination and promoting high LD.</p><p>Although previous studies have linked loci responsible for reproductive isolation to inversions [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], pericentromeric regions [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and sex chromosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], this is one of the few studies focusing on incipient sympatric species in which intrinsic post-reproductive barriers to reproduction are not yet established and therefore investigating the genomic architecture of pre-mating isolation independent of intrinsic post-mating processes. In sulfur butterflies <italic>Colias eurytheme</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>philodice</italic>, pre-mating isolation was associated with an inversion located on the X-chromosome [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but these species co-occur only over a limited hybridization zone. In the hawthorn and apple-infesting races of <italic>Rhagoletis pomonella</italic> flies genomic divergence was found accentuated around 'continents of differentiation' containing inversions on autosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, pre-mating isolation in this model system is ecological and incidental to specialization to different host plants, hence patterns of genetic divergence, migration and gene flow are more akin to those of micro-allopatric speciation.</p><p>Paradoxically, elucidating the processes underpinning the genomic structure of speciation of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> and <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. whose sympatric range spans large areas of Western Africa has proved challenging because of the contrasted patterns of introgression and selection observed within that range [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The experimental functional genomics approach taken here clarifies the role of so-called speciation islands in the speciation process. The results suggest a simple genetic mechanism whereby the low-recombining pericentromeric X-island enables these incipient species to maintain their genetic integrity in Central and Eastern areas of Africa where introgression is uncommon or temporally limited [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and in the hybrid zones of coastal Western Africa where gene flow is extensive [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The results are compatible with model of sympatric speciation in which the X-chromosome island played an active role in speciation that involved 'divergence hitchhiking' around key speciation loci [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Whether the 2L and 3L islands have played similar important roles remains to be demonstrated. In this study we found no evidence of a direct association of the 2L and 3L islands with asssortative mating since the recombinant where either homozygous or nearly homozygous M-type for these regions. Therefore it is unlikely that these islands of differentiation play a major role in conspecific mate recognition.</p><p>In terms of physical size and the number of genes it contain, the X-island of speciation was the largest of the three pericentromeric islands described between <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii and An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. through genome-wide studies [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Depending on the markers and populations considered, previous studies reported it as spanning 3&#x02013;5Mb and as many as 75&#x02013;200 genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Two studies showed that recombination was reduced by as much as 16 and 35-fold near the centromere compared to elsewhere on the X chromosome [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Based on our comparisons of sympatric populations from Ghana and the recombinant strains, we estimated that the island is over 6Mb-long and extends from positions ~18.1 to 24.2Mb. Within the island, 20 unique protein-coding changes affecting 12 genes were identified between the two sibling species. Amongst these genes, 6 have putative biological functions: <italic>AGAP001002</italic> (Toll protein) is involved in development and immunity and <italic>AGAP001033</italic> (mab-21 like protein) in neural and sensory organ development; <italic>AGAP001050</italic> (chondroitin polymerizing factor) and <italic>AGAP001052</italic> (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase) are involved in protein secretion and proteolysis; <italic>AGAP001022</italic> (gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor) is a receptor for peptides in the brain and gastrointestinal tract; and <italic>AGAP001025</italic> (protein msta) is involved in negative regulation of gene expression. Some of these genes might directly be involved with mating or interact with mating genes located elsewhere in the genome. However, others could also affect genes contributing to the ecological speciation of the sibling species, such as those responsible for form-specific larval habitat use [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and larval predator avoidance behaviour [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Although we did not target intergenic regions when re-sequencing the X-island, these would warrant further investigation as they might contain regulatory elements with cis and trans effects on genes within the X, 2L and 3L island and possibly elsewhere in the genome. Trans-acting effects could explain the generally poor correspondence between differentially-expressed genes and islands of divergence observed in some <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> and <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. populations [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this study, the parental Mopti and Kisumu strains did not quite mate as perfectly assortatively as the RbMM and RbSS strains with homogenized genome. This would suggest that, in the parental strains, genetic interactions between the X-island and other parts of the parental genomes might have been responsible for a more variable mating phenotype. It should be note that although fixed non-synonymous coding differences were only identified within the selectively-introgressed X-island region, a number of non-coding differences were identified elsewhere in the genome. These might either be chance fixations due to the introgression process or be genuine differences between the parental Kisumu and Mopti strains. Therefore, and albeit we consider it highly unlikely, we cannot strictly rule out the possibility that a non-coding difference may have accidentally resulted in an assortative mating mechanism unique to the Kisumu and Mopti laboratory pairing and the resulting recombinant strains model system.</p><p>Despite the methodological complexities inherent in the creation of assortatively-mating recombinant strains and their behavioural and genomic characterization, the resulting laboratory-based model holds much promise for further characterization of assortative mating in <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic>. The occurrence of strict female mate-choice in behavioural assays implies the perfect phenotypic expression of species-specific recognition mechanisms in females as well as perfect cues in males. Although no male-driven mate choice was detected in the laboratory, this does not mean that males do not contribute to assortative mating in nature. In the field, males are known to contribute to assortative mating via swarm spatial segregation [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, in large outdoor enclosure mate-choice experiments in which either virgin females or males of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> were presented with an equal number of conspecific and interspecific mates, both females and males were found to mate significantly assortatively [<xref rid="pgen.1005141.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>We are currently conducting finer phenotypic characterization of the RbMM and RbSS strains in an attempt to identify con-specific mate recognition mechanisms that result in assortative mating. Importantly, the availability of the RbMM and RbSS strains and the development of a standardized laboratory-based mating assay offers the possibility of direct validation of candidate reproductive isolation genes via knockdown and/or knockout experiments combined with accurate phenotyping. Unravelling the genetic basis of mate choice and assortative mating is not only relevant to our understanding of processes of speciation, it can also play a crucial role in improving the mating behaviour of anopheline strains that are mass-reared for sterile-male release programmes and the control of malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Mosquito strains and rearing</title><p>The Kisumu strain of an <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s.

In preliminary assortative mating experiments, 2-5-day-old virgin females from a given recombinant strain and X-chromosome island type were given a choice of 2-5-day-old recombinant males matching and non-matching their own X-island type. For each of 4 replicates, 30 females, 30 M-type and 30 S-type island males were placed in a standard 5L rearing cages with access to 5% glucose solution and given 24 hours to mate (6pm start). Infrared video recordings show that under these conditions, males initiated swarms soon after the insectary lights went off.
