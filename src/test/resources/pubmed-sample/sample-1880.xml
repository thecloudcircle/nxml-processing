Interest in the development of rapid and preferably on-site methods for quantification of BAs is based on their important role in implementation and regulation of various physiological processes. At the same time, BAs can develop in different kinds of food by fermentation processes or microbial activity or arise due to contamination, which induces toxicological risks and food poisoning and causes serious health issues. Therefore, various optical chemosensor systems have been devised that are easy to assemble and fast responding and low-cost analytical tools. If amenable to on-site analysis, they are an attractive alternative to existing instrumental analytical methods used for BA determination in food. Hence, also portable sensor systems or dipstick sensors are described based on various probes that typically enable signal readouts such as photometry, reflectometry, luminescence, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, or ellipsometry. The quantification of BAs in real food samples and the design of the sensors are highlighted and the analytical figures of merit are compared. Future instrumental trends for BA sensing point to the use of cell phone&#x02013;based fully automated optical evaluation and devices that could even comprise microfluidic micro total analysis systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Optical sensor</kwd><kwd>Biogenic amine</kwd><kwd>Colorimetry</kwd><kwd>Fluorescence</kwd><kwd>SERS</kwd><kwd>Dipstick</kwd><kwd>Food quality</kwd><kwd>Reflectometry</kwd><kwd>Chemiluminescence</kwd><kwd>Ellipsometry</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)</institution></funding-source><award-id>91614688</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-13-00081</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Biogenic amines (BAs) are small organic molecules, which show high biological activity. They mainly arise in tissues of living organisms as a result of enzymatic decarboxylation of amino acids or by amination and transamination of aldehydes and ketones. In fresh foods, they are mostly found in protein-rich samples but their concentrations in any food can quickly increase upon improper storage. The molecular structure of some main BAs which can occur in food and which are involved in food poisoning is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Molecular structures of main biogenic amines present in food</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="216_2020_2675_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">This review focuses in detail on optical chemosensor systems for BA determination in quality control of real food samples and particularly highlights the analytical aspects of the various optical detection methods. Commonly, different types of probes (organic dyes, metal-ligand complexes, nanomaterials, enzymes, etc.) and sensor designs as well as signal readouts find their way into BA sensors, and hence, those are classified here with respect to the various optical detection methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Biogenic amines as indicators of food spoilage</title><p id="Par4">Fish, meat, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and chocolate and various beverages like wine or beer are typical foodstuffs in which BAs are present at various concentration levels. The concentration of BAs in food depends on their nature and bacterial environment. Although BAs can act as hormones and neurotransmitters, their potential toxicity accounts for their significant role in food analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Papageorgiou and co-workers summarized different matrices (food and beverage products) in their review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] that could contain biogenic amines in order to show which of them should be continuosly monitored for their toxicity. Moreover, the regulation policy and the toxicity of BAs are discussed.</p><p id="Par5">Histamine is one of the most bioactive and toxic BAs, which can trigger an allergic reaction in humans and mammals. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the World Health Organization (WHO), there are some ranges of BA concentration in foodstuff which point to various levels of food quality or food degradation. A concentration of histamine of less than 50&#x000a0;mg/kg indicates good-quality fresh food. Concentrations of histamine between 50 and 200&#x000a0;mg/kg may cause adverse health effects and levels above 200&#x000a0;mg/kg of histamine are reported to cause toxic effects in humans. Cadaverine and putrescine can potentiate the toxic effect of histamine. Poisoning of BAs on the one hand depends on the amount that has entered the body and on the other hand also on the individual human sensitivity to each BA. The permissible concentrations of other BAs are greater than that of histamine. Therefore, e.g., doses of tyramine can vary from 600 up to 2000&#x000a0;mg, depending on the individual tolerance of each person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Inappropriate storage temperature often is the reason for high concentrations of histamine in fish which have formed following decarboxylation under bacterial action from initial histidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Tyramine and &#x003b2;-phenylethylamine may initiate a hypertensive crisis in certain patients and dietary-induced migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Polyamines (putrescine, spermine, spermidine, and cadaverine), however, play essential functions in living cells and can be present in micro- or even millimolar concentrations. On the other hand, some polyamines can react with nitrite to form carcinogenic nitrosamines, and can also be food spoilage indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, monitoring of BAs is a mandatory part of food analysis as a quality indicator for the sample under investigation.</p><p id="Par6">BA detection in food is challenging because these analytes are very polar and better soluble in water than in organic solvents (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, left column). Furthermore, BAs need to be detected at low concentrations in a complex matrix, in most cases. Hence, sensitive detection methods are required. Furthermore, high selectivity should be provided to avoid that interfering components in food may give a similar response as the target BA. The presence of structurally similar BAs in the sample can further complicate the analysis as a result of competitive interactions with the sensing material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the application of a new sensor to a specific food sample should be validated by a chromatographic method to warrant sufficient selectivity. BA detection by optical analytical methods is often complicated because of the weak capability of BAs to absorb light in the visible range. Therefore, derivatization of BAs with chromophores or fluorophores is employed to make them amenable for being optically analyzed. Further, a huge number of separation methods like GC, HPLC, or capillary electrophoresis is hyphenated with optical, electrochemical, or mass spectrometric detection as shown in recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Finally, ELISAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] are applied for BA determination in foodstuff, as well. The main advantages of those methods are their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, they require highly qualified and trained staff, expensive high-quality reagents, and time-consuming sample preparation (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, left column). In order to overcome these limitations, the recent development of fast, low-cost, and portable chemo and biosensors which can be used for on-site analysis of BAs in food is shown by recent publications covering about the last 10&#x000a0;years, in this review. Kaur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] published a comprehensive review describing the existing probes and their recognition mechanisms (including, e.g., aggregation-induced emission (AIE), ligand exchange mechanism, photo-induced electron transfer (PET)/internal charge transfer (ICT) mechanism, and some others) used for detection of biothiols and biogenic amines. Unlike this earlier publication, the present one focuses on evaluating whole sensors (comprising of probes, transducer, and detector), discussing on-site use capability, and comparing the merits and disadvantages of the various optical detection methods together with discussing the impact of sensor material design (in view of the materials used for embedding of the probe and exclusion of unwanted interferents) on sensor performance. From this wealth of perspectives on the topic, it is obvious that optical sensors for qualitative and quantitative analysis of BAs are an attractive alternative to existing analytical methods and some of them may be handled by non-trained staff or in-field.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Challenges to be solved in the determination of BAs in real food samples and merits of optical sensors that promote their use</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Challenges of BA determination</th><th>Advantages of optical sensors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>a. derivatization of BAs and compliance with green chemistry;</p><p>b. strong polar character of BAs;</p><p>c. low concentration ranges of BAs;</p><p>d. presence of complex matrix with potentially interfering compounds;</p><p>e. occurrence of several BAs simultaneously;</p><p>f. complexity of sample matrix;</p><p>g. time for sampling, work-up, and detection;</p><p>h. requirement of trained personnel.</p></td><td><p>General:</p><p>a. fast signal reading and processing;</p><p>b. low-cost instrumentation;</p><p>c. minimum amount of sample required;</p><p>d. ease of operation;</p><p>e. evaluation by public domain software;</p><p>f. acceptable for analysis by less-trained users;</p><p>g. flexible size from &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> to cm<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>h. multiplexing/array sensing possible;</p><p>i. amenable to remote sensing;</p><p>j. no electrodes required.</p><p>Luminescence sensors:</p><p>general advantages as from a&#x02013;j;</p><p>k. high sensitivity.</p><p>Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy sensor:</p><p>general advantages as from a, c, d, f&#x02013;j;</p><p>l. high sensitivity.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sensor design and detection methods</title><p id="Par7">Most of the optical sensors for BAs follow the classical sensor design where a probe for recognition is immobilized in a membrane and/or fixed on a suitable support which can be paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], glass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], TLC plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], microtiter plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and test tubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To deposit the recognition layer, knife coating, spin coating, or simple soaking may be used. The probe is mostly embedded into a polymer layer as a thin film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], or eventually allowed to settle on another film of, e.g., gold or silicon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], on polymer particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], on a hydrogel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], or inside nanofibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Those will be discussed in the following sections together the individual sensor schemes and with their major merits towards quantitation of BAs in real samples.

Unfortunately, many BAs themselves do not carry structural features that promote their optical detection (i.e., large conjugated &#x003c0;-systems which are necessary for reflectometric, photometric, or fluorimetric readout), so they need to be transformed into corresponding derivatives with the desirable detection properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The derivatization reagents may be divided into several groups: they can be chromophores and fluorophores (to impart absorption of UV light or fluoresce emission into the derivatives, respectively); fluorogenic molecules (which show fluoresce upon formation of the fluorescent derivative with the analyte); and redox reagents (which reduce/oxidize analytes to enable detection). For instance, reagents such as o-phthalic aldehyde, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB), 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), 4-fluoro-3-dinitro-fluoromethylbenzene, ninhydrin, benzoyl chloride, and many others were widely used for derivatization of primary or secondary amines or polyamines to form colored products, followed by their chromatographic determination with absorbance or a fluorescence detector. However, most of these methods require expensive instrumentation that cannot be used in the field and the related reagents cannot be used in optical sensors for BAs because they lack long-term storage stability inside the sensor membrane.</p><p id="Par9">Optical sensors (so-called pH opt(r)odes) have the merit not to require electrodes and hence to be electrically safe which made them increasingly attractive in the fields of gas sensing, ion sensing, bioanalysis, and pH sensing. Optodes are based on changes of optical properties such as absorbance, fluorescence, luminescence, chemiluminescence, energy transfer, or reflectance by measuring the intensity of light in various regions of the spectrum (UV, visible, NIR, IR). Moreover, related properties such as light scattering, luminescence lifetime, refractive index (via surface plasmon resonance spectrometry), diffraction, and polarization may be exploited analytically. Optodes are beneficial due to their flexibility in size and shape, low cost, fast response, and light weight (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, right column). They can be used in both aqueous and organic media and can deliver information with either highly local resolution (using fiber-optical sensors down to &#x003bc;m), which additionally can reduce the sample volume down to nanoliters. This is, e.g., hardly available for electrical sensors. Also areas until tens of square centimeters can be read using in optical imaging. A further benefit is the potential to use multiplexed sensing, e.g., when various optical probes with different detection wavelengths are used for simultaneously probing a collection of analytes or to build up and read out a sensor array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Arrays of multiple sensors with similar and low selectivity often require multivariate data analysis methods to introduce analyte selectivity and also enable prediction of the freshness of food samples. Luminescence is the detection method of choice if high sensitivity is required because due to the absence of interfering excitation light, it is more sensitive than reflectometry and photometry. Sensors based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) present another modern highly sensitive alternative here because they are based on analyte-induced changes of the refractive index. For appropriate use in food sensing, these sensors may require either labeling or derivatization procedures in or on the sensor membrane or a sample pretreatment that involves analyte separation from the matrix to warrant selectivity. Leaching or photobleaching of the optical probe may compromise long-term stability and therefore has to be carefully controlled, as well as selectivity. Optical sensors are suitable for remote sensing (even over distances of kilometers) and can be used for in vivo measurements because of their immunity to electromagnetic interferences. This wide range of how optical sensors can be tailored makes them hot candidates for emerging into new fields like food chemistry that is dominated by more expensive separation methods (GC and HPLC) hyphenated to various optical, electrical, or mass detection techniques. Here, optical sensors can operate on a much less expensive level by using, e.g., digital cameras, smartphones, or flatbed scanners for detection together with public domain software for evaluation. The use of these inexpensive components provides a much easier operation of the sensors. This will further promote the use of optical sensors in food sensing as well as by less-trained personnel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Reflectometric readout</title><p id="Par10">Frequently, colored or fluorescent dyes, such as acid-base indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], porphyrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], phthalocyanines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], chameleon dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], coumarine derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], azodyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], or nanomaterials, are used for optical BA determination. Among them, selectivity may be either introduced by a specific reaction, (co-)introduced by the material(s) the sensor is composed of, or is the result of chemometric evaluation of data from a sensor array. Such arrays may either be composed of several highly selective sensors to provide multi-analyte sensing or contain many sensors of low specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] that may also be evaluated by pattern recognition. In general, reflectometric sensors require a light source, a wavelength-dispersive element to select the detection wavelength(s), and a detector. In modern setups, only one or few inexpensive LEDs (for array illumination) may be used as light source. Considering the narrow spectral bandwidth of those, selection of the light reflected from the sensor can be accomplished either by optical filters which are low-cost devices or by the detector itself if CCDs or CMOS sensors are used. These sensors typically deliver an RGB (red-green-blue) readout of a sensor array, as shown in several publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] which can open a gate for multi-wavelength detection if the reflected light or different sensors matche the red, green, and blue spectral window of the array detector. The widespread use of those detectors in digital cameras and cell phones opens many new options for the use of these inexpensive devices for the readout of reflectometric sensors in food analysis and point-of-care diagnostics. The rapid sensor readout and simple evaluation by public domain or OEM software are further advantages of the reflectometric readout. Hence, the major advantages of reflectometric optical sensors are their instrumental simplicity, the option to arrange (multi-)sensor arrays with reasonable demand, and rapid evaluation with commercial detection equipment. Hence, a complete sensor (array) can be produced for a few hundred US $ or less. The major drawback of reflectometric sensors is their comparatively low sensitivity and accurate positioning of the sensor (spot) with respect to light source and detector is required.</p><p id="Par11">In one study, an array of five pH indicators (methyl red, alizarin, bromophenol blue, thymol blue, chlorophenol red) in cellulose acetate membranes with Tween as plasticizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] was read in short time (10&#x000a0;min) to discriminate between isobutylamine, triethylamine, and isopentylamine in ppm concentrations through RGB readout via a cell phone. The mechanism of the color change is based on BA solubility and acidity constants. RGB analysis data of the color difference map of the membranes prior and after reaction with BAs was fed into chemometric analysis (principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis) for non-supervised pattern recognition evaluation. This can help the readout of the array for users that are color blind because the three BAs could then be discriminated without misclassification.

TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoporous films were found to be superior as a support compared with C<sub>2</sub> reverse silica gel plates on which colorimetric arrays of dyes were printed using microcapillary pipettes. Chemometric analysis was again required after trimethylamine (TMA) vapor was detected using reflectometric RGB color difference maps recorded by a flatbed scanner. The data from the color difference maps was analyzed with principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis and the use of partial least square models allowed the prediction of the TMA content in meat samples and their freshness.

They share most of the advantages of reflectometry such as the requirement of only one or few (for reading arrays) inexpensive and simple light sources. Devices for the selection of the detection wavelength (e.g., filters) are only required if broadband light sources or multi-wavelength arrays are used. Hence, photometry can even be more simple than reflectometry. Similarly to the reflectometric readout, detection may be done with photodiodes, CCDs, or CMOS sensors. The latter two became more and more popular with the common use of digital cameras and cell phones. Those are most frequently employed, if sensor arrays are to be read out.

The requirement of an excitation light source and optical devices for selection of excitation and emission light together with blocking excitation light off the detector show that luminescence setups are more demanding and expensive than photometric and reflectometric schemes. Aside from the classical rectangular arrangement of excitation and emission light to read planar sensor membranes, fiber optic setups became very popular over the last decades. Those share the advantages that the excitation light can be brought closely even to remote samples and be read out even through transparent polymers (e.g., detection through the wall of a plastic vessel or food package with a sensor layer fixed at the inside wall). Moreover, if the excitation light is guided to an array of sensors or fed into a several optical fibers (with different sensors attached), multi-analyte sensing becomes feasible.

The underlying kinetic of the reaction imposes a transient signal, which often is amplified by coupling with an enzymatic reaction and/or an enhancer molecule for analytical purposes. Most importantly, as no excitation light is required, much less background signal and scatter from the matrix of real samples can be expected to occur when using CL detection as compared with reflectometry, photometry, or luminescence detection. This yields very low detection limits in many cases provided that no cross-reactions of enhancer and analyte molecule occur. Further, the absence of an excitation source makes instrumentation for these methods considerably simpler because just a light-tight detection cell, sample holder, light-collecting lens, and a sensitive photodiode are required. This way, CL detection is even more simple than reflectometry or photometry, and hence, CL sensors have the potential for miniaturization and on-site analysis. These advantages hold true, if CL is coupled, e.g., with enzymatic signal enhancement and luminol, and also imposes restrictions in the selection of analytes via the choice of the enzyme.

Enhancement factors up to 10<sup>14</sup> have moved detection limits of this method to the single molecule level, albeit this concentration level cannot be expected in real samples but is obtained with research-level instrumentation, only. The main limitations of SERS-based BA detection in food analysis are the relatively high price of a portable Raman spectrometer (10,000&#x02013;30,000 Euro) and the requirement for noble metal nanoparticles in the sample or a nanopatterned surface for quantitation.

A chemometric analysis (e.g., principal component analysis) was also widely used in order to improve the analysis performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The comparison of results obtained by SERS and HPLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] shows that the TLC-SERS protocol with simple partial least square regression analysis also has acceptable precision (RSD &#x0003c;&#x02009;10%). Additionally, the effect of TLC sample pretreatment on the reduction of the RSD is significantly larger than that of the chemometric treatment making a sample pretreatment step mandatory for reliable analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This is in accordance with the general rule that sampling and sample pretreatment have more impact on precision of an analysis than the detection method itself, if real samples are studied. Finally, an advantage of all listed protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] is the use of simple AuNPs solutions as SERS substrates with appropriate reliability and efficiency in the sample pretreatment process.</p><p id="Par40">Besides detection of histamine (e.g., in seafood and fermented foodstuff), SERS can be successfully used for monitoring the decomposition (spoiling) of non-fermented foods, as well. For example, Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] proposed MIP-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for direct SERS detection of histamine in solution down to 0.1&#x000a0;mg/L. The assay for histamine detection in spiked samples showed an appropriate accuracy with apparent recovery in the ranges 85&#x02013;117% (canned tuna) and 93&#x02013;108% (red and rice wines).</p><p id="Par41">Besides histamine, there are also some reports on detection of tyramine. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] combined SERS with high-performance TLC for tyramine detection in cheese. The authors successfully detected tyramine at 30&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg/kg in cheese (not spiked) with an apparent recovery within the 84&#x02013;108% range.</p><p id="Par42">As a conclusion, SERS expects a bright future as an on-site sensing method in food control if the prices for instruments will decrease with an increasing number of purchased devices and if further miniaturized instruments will be available. It has all the merits to become a viable on-site detection method provided that suitable selectivity can be obtained with a simple sample pretreatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion and outlook</title><p id="Par43">This review shows that a wide variety of optical sensors and methods for BA quantification in food exist that have the potential for future commercialization due to simplification of the sampling and detection schemes and proven applicability to real food samples. Presumably, the most widely used detection methods will comprise either photometry, reflectance, or chemiluminescence using cell phone analysis due to the simplicity of the required instrumentation. However, also digital photographic sensor schemes seem promising because they can acquire photometric, reflectometric, or even fluorescence responses of a chemosensor with good reproducibility in-field at low costs. A fully automated software evaluation of the optical sensors is not available, yet although highly essential for on-site use with less educated staff, which should comprise chemometric data treatment because it has proven to enhance selectivity and reliability of food sensors. Chemometric data treatment is a further step companies could implement to bring food sensing schemes closer to home users and which could be applied to dipstick sensors provided that a simple sample preparation exists. SERS expects a bright future as an on-site sensing method in food control, if the prices for instruments and nanopatterned detection cells will decrease with an increasing number of purchased devices and if further miniaturized instruments will be available. It has all the merits to become a viable on-site detection method provided that suitable selectivity can be obtained with a simple sample pretreatment.</p><p id="Par44">Optical food sensing is also a chance for scientists working with microfluidics to get involved into a new inspiring field of sensor science because miniaturized microfluidic systems could also include automated sample pretreatment steps and combine them with detection inside a micro total analysis system. Hence, there are many access points and techniques to create new optical food sensor schemes and to adapt them to the wealth of analytes in real samples that may be analyzed by home users and the food industry and within food chains all over the world.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding information</title><p>Open Access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.
