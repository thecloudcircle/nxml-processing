However, analytical challenges arise in routine application during the extraction of analytes as silicone oligomers are co-extracted and interfere severely during chemical analyses (e.g. gas chromatographic techniques). In this study, we present a fast, practical pre-cleaning method for silicone passive samplers applying accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) for the removal of silicone oligomers prior to the water deployment (hexane/dichloromethane, 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 70&#x000a0;min). ASE was also shown to be a very fast (10&#x000a0;min) and efficient extraction method for non-polar contaminants (non-exposed PRC recoveries 66&#x02013;101&#x000a0;%) sampled by the silicone membrane. For both applications, temperature, extraction time and the solvent used for ASE have been optimized. Purification of the ASE extract was carried out by silica gel and high-pressure liquid size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC). The silicone oligomer content was checked by total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF) in order to confirm the absence of the silicone oligomers prior to analysis of passive sampler extracts. The established method was applied on real silicone samplers from the North- and Baltic Sea and showed no matrix effects during analysis of organic pollutants. Internal laboratory standard recoveries were in the same range for laboratory, transport and exposed samplers (85&#x02013;126&#x000a0;%).</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Silicone passive sampler</kwd><kwd>Pressurized liquid extraction</kwd><kwd>Accelerated solvent extraction</kwd><kwd>Polydimethylsiloxane</kwd><kwd>TXRF</kwd><kwd>Size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Passive sampling, as time integrated sampling approach, is increasingly used for monitoring of organic contaminants in the water phase providing a cost-efficient alternative to active water sample collection. The basic principle of this sampling method is the passive diffusion and absorption of hydrophobic contaminants from the water phase into the sampler. A large variety of non-polar samplers have been applied so far, among those are semi-permeable membrane devices, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) strip samplers and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) strip samplers (Vrana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>).</p><p>Common characteristics of single-phased passive strip samplers are their simple construction, low costs and the possibility for re-use (Rusina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>). PDMS strip samplers are often the samplers of choice, because polymer-water partition coefficients (<italic>K</italic><sub>pw</sub>) for many contaminants have been reported in the literature (Smedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>). Furthermore, PDMS samplers can absorb chemicals with a wider log <italic>K</italic><sub>OW</sub> range than LDPE strips. In a current comparison study, Allan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>) tested PDMS and LDPE strips for the screening of a wide range of chemicals and showed that PDMS is less discriminating than LDPE with regard to more polar substances such as organophosphate compounds (OPCs). PDMS samplers have been successfully applied for the monitoring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as well as OPCs in both, limnic and marine waters (Smedes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>; Sch&#x000e4;fer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Allan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>).</p><p>However, a major problem of PDMS samplers is the co-extraction of non-crosslinked silicone oligomers from the polymer. Silicone oligomers can cause considerable analytical problems like blocking of high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) columns or coating of gas chromatographic (GC) liner and columns (Smedes and Booij <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Therefore, exhaustive pre-cleaning prior to sampling and extract purification of PDMS sampler are necessary to minimize oligomer release and subsequent interference with chemical analysis (Smedes and Booij <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Shahpoury and Hageman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>; O&#x000b4;Connell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). Common pre-cleaning extraction techniques, e.g. Soxhlet extraction, are solvent- and time-intensive (Sch&#x000e4;fer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Smedes and Booij <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Shahpoury and Hageman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>). Despite of extensive pre-cleaning steps, PDMS sampler extracts often still contain traces of non-crosslinked silicone oligomers (Smedes and Booij <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>), and hence additional purification methods, such as C-18 column chromatography or HPLC-size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are needed (Smedes and Booij <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Shahpoury and Hageman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>). Thus, a more rigorous, faster extraction technique with less solvent consumption as well as an efficient PDMS extract purification method would be favourable.</p><p>In this study, accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) was used to facilitate the pre-cleaning and extraction process of silicone sheets with the aim to decrease time and solvent usage compared to the commonly used methods. Additionally, extraction and purification of PDMS sampler were optimized in order to prevent silicone coating of analytical hardware such as GC-MS. Furthermore, total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) was applied as a new, very fast and easy methodology for the detection and quantification of silicone oligomers in the final extract. The newly established methodology for passive sampler purification and extraction was applied on real marine samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental materials</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Materials</title><p>Sampler strips of 55&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;90&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;mm (Altec, UK) were prepared from AlteSil silicone rubber sheets.

The release of small polymers from silicone rubber (oligomers) by different solvents was tested for eight solvents and combinations, which are used typically for pre-cleaning (ethylacetate, acetone, <italic>n</italic>-hexane, methanol/<italic>n</italic>-pentane (1:1), acetonitrile/methanol (2:1), dichloromethane/acetone (1:1), <italic>n</italic>-hexane/acetone (1:1&#x02009;<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) and <italic>n</italic>-hexane/acetone (3:1&#x02009;<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>)) (Rusina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>; Sch&#x000e4;fer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Ezzell and Richter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>; Smedes and Booij <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Allan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Past studies investigated polymer swelling in organic solvents, which lead to an enhanced fragility of PDMS strips and blockage of solvent flow through the ASE extraction cell (Rusina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>; Shahpoury and Hageman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>).

Purification from co-extracted material was performed by SPE using 500-mg silica gel. Target compounds were eluted with hexane/dichloromethane (70:30, 5&#x000a0;mL) and evaporated to 1&#x000a0;ml by a gentle stream of nitrogen. Extracts were further purified by HPLC-SEC. Co-extracted silicone oligomers were separated by HPLC-SEC (injection volume 0.5&#x000a0;mL) with hexane/dichloromethane (80:20), whereby the first fraction (0&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min) contained the non-crosslinked silicone oligomers and the second fraction the CHCs and PAHs fraction (10&#x02013;28&#x000a0;min). Column temperature was set to 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to avoid adhesion of silicone in the system. The second fraction was concentrated to 0.2&#x000a0;mL with nitrogen and monitored for its oligomer load with TXRF before instrumental analysis. For this, an aliquot of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L was slowly dropped onto pre-cleaned sapphire disc, allowing the organic solvent time to evaporate. The disc was loaded into the TXRF and measured for 1000&#x000a0;s for its silicium load, which is the representative element of the silicone oligomer. A rubidium reference standard was used for instrument calibration. If the silicium load of the sample was in the range of SEC blanks, an analysis of CHCs (GC-MS/MS) and PAHs (GC-MS) was performed.

No swelling and release of oligomers was induced by water, while up to 2.3&#x000a0;% of silicone oligomers were released when non-polar solvents were used (<italic>n</italic>-hexane/acetone (1:1&#x02009;<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>)) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

In contrast to a study of Shahpoury and Hageman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>), none of the used solvents expanded the silicone rubber as drastically as to block the solvent flow. However, the blockage might depend on the volume of silicone rubber relative to the volume of the extraction cell. Rusina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>) showed that PDMS strips became more breakable after increased swelling. Thus, the 1:1 combination of hexane/acetone was used as the solvent of choice in further pre-cleaning experiments, providing a high oligomer release rate with medium swelling (20&#x000a0;%). In all experiments, PDMS strips regained their original size and strength after the drying process (evaporation of the solvent).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Release of oligomers as a function of swelling for different organic solvents (water, methanol/acetonitrile, methanol/pentane, acetone, hexane, hexane/acetone, dichloromethane/acetone, ethylacetate) using ASE (100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11356_2015_5192_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>It was found that the amount of released oligomers from silicone rubber strips increased with increasing extraction time up to 70&#x000a0;min with no further release with increasing time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), indicating the oligomer release from the silicone rubber strips to be fairly exhausted.

Thus, the ASE default temperature of 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was applied.</p><p>Additionally to the determination of the weight of the PDMS strips, corresponding extracts were analysed by GC-MS to proof the differences in weight to be a result of oligomer release. All extracts of silicone rubber pre-cleaning showed the typical repeating peaks of silicone oligomers, with the peaks containing the ions m/z 73, 147, 221, 282, 355 and 429, finally leading to silicone coating of GC liner and column.</p><p>In all different pre-clean-up procedures used, a significant amount of mass (&#x0003e;2&#x000a0;%) was released from the PDMS strips (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). While the swelling of the PDMS strips was highly variable from 42&#x000a0;% (ASE) to 124&#x000a0;% (extraction with hexane/acetone), release rates were quite uniform, all above 2&#x000a0;%, ranging from 2.2&#x000a0;% (ASE) to 2.5&#x000a0;% (Soxhlet extraction with ethylacetate and extraction with hexane/acetone).</p><p>Silicone rubber pre-cleaning with ASE takes only 70&#x000a0;min and is thus much faster as other classical pre-cleaning methods like Soxhlet or shaking extraction (36&#x02013;100&#x000a0;h) (Smedes and Booij <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Shahpoury and Hageman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>). Thus, ASE-based methods enhance the suitability of silicone rubber samplers for routine applications profoundly as it reduce labour time considerably. In addition, no long-term preparation of campaigns is necessary, making this sampler type suitable for deployments on short notice (which is not possible using traditional clean-up methods).</p><p>Although the silicone sheets have been thoroughly pre-cleaned, traces of oligomers are still co-extracted during sampler extraction after deployment. Quantitative determination of silicones was not carried out by GC or GC-MS because they quickly destroy the GC performance. Instead, we found that TXRF proved to be a very fast and easy procedure to detect and quantify silicone oligomers. Measurements with TXRF revealed that more than 90&#x000a0;% of extractable silicone oligomers could be removed by the pre-cleaning step with ASE similar to other cleaning procedures. Thus, further cleanup of the sample extract is still mandatory to avoid instrument interferences, such as silicone coating of gas chromatography (GC) liners.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Optimization of the organic solvent for ASE extraction</title><p>Results of the solvent extraction experiments using ASE showed that the analytes were extracted within the first 10&#x000a0;min. The recovery rates of IS (CHC and PAH) increased with decreasing polarity of the solvent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Within the more polar solvents (acetonitrile and acetonitrile/methanol) recovery rates were better for aromatic compounds with 4- or more rings like fluoranthene, benz[e]pyrene and benz[ghi]perylene (56&#x02013;108&#x000a0;%) than for the more volatile 2- and 3-ring aromatic compounds naphthalene, acenapthene and anthracene (4&#x02013;32&#x000a0;%).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Recovery rate of internal CHC and PAH standards using different solvents (dichloromethane, acetonitrile) and solvent mixtures (<italic>n</italic>-hexane/acetone (1:1&#x02009;<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>); acetonitrile/methanol (2:1&#x02009;<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>)) by ASE extraction (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 for each solvent (&#x02212;mixture))</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11356_2015_5192_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>Polar solvents need to be transferred to non-polar solvents as recommended by Smedes and Booij (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>), and this additional step may be responsible for lower recovery yields of lower boiling point analytes (2- and 3-ring PAH, &#x003b5;-HCH and TCN). Thus, in terms of better extract efficiencies and higher recoveries of non-polar contaminants, non-polar extraction solvents such as hexane or dichloromethane should be used. However, non-polar extraction solvents co-extract more silicone oligomers, simultaneously. Therefore, an additional cleanup step is necessary, which was performed by HPLC-SEC as described in &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Removing silicone oligomers from sample extracts by HPLC-SEC</xref>&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Removing silicone oligomers from sample extracts by HPLC-SEC</title><p>Measurements of PDMS extracts with TXRF showed co-extraction of silicone oligomers (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Optimization of the silicon rubber pre-cleaning</xref>&#x0201d;). Hence, extracts had to be further purified to avoid coating of instrumental parts. Smedes and Booij (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>) recommend extract purification with C-18 bonded silica cartridges, which is suitable for methanol or acetonitrile/methanol as solvent. Due to the fact that the ideal solvent for PDMS sampler extraction with ASE was found to be non-polar (&#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Optimization of the organic solvent for ASE extraction</xref>&#x0201d;), alternative purification steps needed to be performed. Shahpoury and Hageman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>) used SEC to remove silicone oligomers from sample extracts only for PAH analysis. HPLC-SEC can be set up with non-polar solvents and hence no solvent transfer from non-polar to polar and back is necessary, which can potentially result in lower analyte recoveries by using C-18 silica cartridges. In this study, HPLC-SEC was tested for the separation of PAH and CHCs from silicone oligomers using a mixture of hexane-dichloromethane as eluent in order to keep the same extraction solvents during the entire extraction procedure. Monitoring the resulting SEC fractions with TXRF showed that the majority of silicone oligomers (mean 98.9&#x000a0;%) were present in the first fraction (0&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min). Less than 1&#x000a0;% (average 0.3&#x000a0;%) of the original silicone oligomer content was left in the second fraction (10&#x02013;28&#x000a0;min), in which the target CHCs and PAHs were eluted. HPLC-SEC is restricted to a certain amount of residual oligomers, e.g. if the pre-cleaning step to remove residual oligomers is skipped, the burden for a semi-preparative column to separate target compounds from oligomers is too high. HPLC-SEC thus proved to be a very efficient purification method to remove co-extracted silicone oligomers showing the additional advantage that no solvent exchange is necessary.</p><p>Additionally to HPLC-SEC, the fast monitoring of the silicone content in each (purified) extract by TXRF avoids analytical interferences and coating of instrument parts (e.g. GC liner and column).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Field samples</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Recovery rates</title><p>The whole set of deployed sampler, transport and laboratory blanks was extracted and purified as described in &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Sample extraction</xref>&#x0201d;.
