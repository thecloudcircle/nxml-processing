However, the direct anti-HCC effects of metformin have hardly been studied in patients, but have been extensively investigated in animal models of HCC.

Studies were included according to the following inclusion criteria: HCC, animal study, and metformin intervention. Study quality was assessed using SYRCLE&#x02019;s risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed for the outcome measures: tumor growth (tumor volume, weight and size), tumor number and incidence.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>The search resulted in 573 references, of which 13 could be included in the review and 12 included in the meta-analysis. The study characteristics of the included studies varied considerably. Two studies used rats, while the others used mice. Only one study used female animals, nine used male, and three studies didn&#x02019;t mention the gender of animals in their experiments. The quality of the included studies was low to moderate based on the assessment of their risk of bias. The meta-analysis showed that metformin significantly inhibited the growth of HCC tumour (SMD -2.20[-2.96,-1.43]; n=16), but no significant effect on the number of tumors (SMD-1.05[-2.13,0.03]; n=5) or the incidence of HCC was observed (RR 0.62[0.33,1.16]; n=6). To investigate the potential sources of significant heterogeneities found in outcome of tumor growth (I<sup>2</sup>=81%), subgroup analyses of scales of growth measures and of types of animal models used were performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Metformin appears to have a direct anti-HCC effect in animal models.

Surgical resection and liver transplantation are the only potentially curative treatment for a small proportion of the patients. However, disease recurrence hampers the ultimate success of the treatment [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, was approved to treat advanced HCC. This however only increases patient survival with approximately 2&#x02013;3 months [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new strategies to improve the management of HCC.</p><p>Metformin is an oral drug widely used for treatment of type II diabetes. Interestingly, several studies, including observational studies and some randomized controlled trials (RCT), have reported that metformin can affect the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in diabetic patients [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although these studies have suggested a preventive effect of metformin on the risk of HCC in these diabetic patients, there is still lacking of investigation whether metformin has direct anti-tumor effect in HCC patients. Nevertheless, substantial research has been performed in animal models of HCC, although the data are still inconclusive. Meta-analyses on data from animal studies can be used to explain clinical observation and to inform clinical trial design.</p><p>To better understand the direct effects of metformin on HCC and to pave the way for further prospective clinical study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available data from HCC animal models treated with metformin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Review protocol</title><p>A protocol for this systematic review was prepared using SYRCLE&#x02019;s protocol format (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/Research/Organisationofresearch/Departments/cdl/SYRCLE/Pages/Protocols.aspx">https://www.radboudumc.nl/Research/Organisationofresearch/Departments/cdl/SYRCLE/Pages/Protocols.aspx</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Literature search</title><p>A systematic search (conducted on July 2014, without any restrictions on publication data or language) was conducted in Medline (OvidSP), Embase.com, Web of Science, and Scopus.

A meta-analysis of the effects of anti-diabetic medications on the HCC risk, in which both observational and RCT studies were included, has suggested a half reduction in HCC incidence when using metformin treatment [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, our meta-analysis systematically analyzed all relevant animal studies to assess the therapeutic potential of metformin against HCC.</p><p>In this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyzed and described the effects of metformin on HCC growth and incidence. The overall analysis of the effect of growth showed that use of metformin was associated with a significant inhibitory effect (SMD = -2.20&#x000b1;0.76) on HCC growth, compared to untreated group. This therapeutic effect remained stable across subgroups of tumor volume, tumor weight and tumor size. It was most pronounced in &#x0201c;tumor volume&#x0201d; measurement while least in &#x0201c;tumor size&#x0201d; measurement. Besides, we performed subgroup analysis under the &#x0201c;tumor growth&#x0201d;. Both xenograft and non-xenograft studies showed significant inhibitory effect of metformin on HCC growth.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Mechanism underlying metformin anti-HCC</title><p>The anti-cancer effect of metformin was speculated to be associated with the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). An important upstream kinase of AMPK is LKB1, an very important tumor suppressor [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This signaling pathway was also discussed and explored in the included HCC animal trials. The coexistence of AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms for the effects of metformin on cancer was proposed[<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. But we should keep in mind of different study methodologies. For instance, two studies used cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; one study used tumor harvested from xenograft[<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; whereas one study demonstrated their result based on observing AMPK level in liver[<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, metformin may also inhibit HCC cell growth by regulating cell-cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1 and cyclin E [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Of particular note, c-myc was suggested as a critical mediator in hepatocarcinogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Metformin treatment has been shown to inhibit c-myc expression by up-regulating let-7 family (tumor suppressor) [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, no study among the included animal studies discussed such mechanism underlying specific HCC stage. Although we found one human study relevant to early stage of HCC, no clear mechanistic insight of metformin on early stage HCC was described[<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Side effects of metformin in animal models</title><p>Being a classic antidiabetic medication, metformin is widely used among patients because of its relatively low cost and high safety profile. 10 out of 13 studies included in this systematic review mentioned tolerability of metformin treatment. These studies consistently showed that metformin didn&#x02019;t change body weight and serum glucose level of animals. However, it should also be taken into consideration of further investigation on the appropriate therapeutic dosage rang of metformin for anti-cancer treatment. Evaluation of safety with these particular dosages is very necessary, especially when metformin is applied in non-diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations</title><p>By using the risk of bias tool, we found out that reporting is poor and therefore the methodological quality of many studies is unclear. It shows that there is much room for improvement, since many items were shown &#x0201c;unclear&#x0201d; and only a few items were shown low risk only in very few studies. Besides, by visualizing the funnel plot, publication bias seems also to be present, probably due to the missing of studies with no or negative effects. Actually, in total, only 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Both the unclear methodological quality and publication bias might lead to under or overestimation of the overall effect size of metformin effect on anti-HCC, which is an additional threat to the robustness of the data especially the ones that are already inconclusive. What&#x02019;s more, high heterogeneity was also seen among the studies, which is common in animal studies, although we tried to explore the potential factors contributing the heterogeneity. All of these potential limitations might influence us to draw concrete conclusions on the anti-HCC effect of metformin.</p><p>Besides, there were some methodological issues which might influence the translation of animal results to human trials. Firstly, the literature is unclear about which animal method is most representative for patient HCC. We found various HCC methods used in these studies: xenograft, DEN-induction, transgenic and dietary models. Secondly, there are two different administration routes (oral or i.p.) of metformin in the studies. However, metformin is usually an orally administrated drug in clinic, raising the question whether administration method could also affect the effect of metformin on tumor.</p><p>HCC invasion and metastasis are crucial factors related to poor prognosis. However, none of the animal studies described if metformin had potential effect on HCC metastasis, except one study indirectly mentioned correlation of metformin/p-AMPK with distant metastasis in human HCC cohort study [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Another limitation is that these animal studies did not study the HCC stage indicated for metformin. HCC stage could be an important factor for the therapeutic efficacy of metformin and has implication for selecting appropriate candidates for metformin treatment. Therefore, it&#x02019;s very necessary to take the stage of HCC into account in the experimental design. As for xenograft animal model, which were used in most of the studies, however, it&#x02019;s hard to define the cancer stage which didn&#x02019;t discuss in the studies. In addition, although it&#x02019;s possible to identify tumor stage in spontaneous animal tumor model, the authors did not report any information about HCC stage in their animal study[<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Based on the results of this meta-analysis, metformin could potentially have a therapeutic effect on HCC. Besides, the maximal dose of metformin used in all the included animal studies were consistent with human therapeutic dose in diabetics according to the calculation [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This furthermore supported the reliable and applicable results from animal models. Although several clinical studies reported that metformin could negatively modify the risk of HCC in diabetic patients [<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127967.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], there are not yet any clinical trial investigating the therapeutic effect of metformin on HCC. Currently, several ongoing clinical trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) are evaluating the effects of metformin on different cancers (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.), But not for HCC. Thus, the results of this systematic review provide an important reference for the future preclinical animal trials with high quality to aid the development of metformin for anti-HCC treatment in clinical trials. Considering the dominant risk factor for HCC in many western countries in particular United States--obesity and metabolic syndrome, metformin would be an appropriate choice for such a high-risk of population of HCC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this systematic review of animal studies suggests that metformin potentially has a direct inhibitory effect on HCC growth, although the effects on tumor number and incidence are inconclusive. It supports the clinical observation that metformin is associated with lower risk of HCC in diabetic patients. Although these animal studies have some intrinsic limitations, these results do provide an important reference for future high-quality preclinical animal trials and potential clinical development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127967.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Search Strategy.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127967.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127967.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>PRISMA Checklist for the Systematic Review and Meta-analysis to Estimate the anti-HCC effect of metformin in animal studies.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127967.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Rob BM de Vries for critically revising the manuscript.
