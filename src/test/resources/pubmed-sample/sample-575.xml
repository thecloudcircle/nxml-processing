Six approaches were used to evaluate protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in this system. Fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) using MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP and MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP revealed that the homodimeric Enzyme II complex in cell membranes is stable (FRET<sup>-</sup>) but can be dissociated and reassociated to the heterodimer only in the presence of Triton X100 (FRET<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). The monomeric species could form a heterodimeric species (FRET<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) by incubation and purification without detergent exposure. Formaldehyde cross linking studies, conducted both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, revealed that the dimeric MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup> activity decreased dramatically with increasing formaldehyde concentrations due to both aggregation and activity loss, but that the monomeric MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup> retained activity more effectively in response to the same formaldehyde treatments, and little or no aggregation was observed. Electron microscopy of MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup> indicated that the dimeric form is larger than the monomeric form. Dynamic light scattering confirmed this conclusion and provided quantitation. NMR analyses provided strong evidence that the dimeric form is present primarily in a lipid bilayer while the monomeric form is present as micelles. Finally, lipid analyses of the different fractions revealed that the three lipid species (PE, PG and CL) are present in all fractions, but the monomeric micellar structure contains a higher percentage of anionic lipids (PG &#x00026; CL) while the dimeric bilayer form has a higher percentage of zwitterion lipids (PE). Additionally, evidence for a minor dimeric micellar species, possibly an intermediate between the monomeric micellar and the dimeric bilayer forms, is presented. These results provide convincing evidence for interconvertible physical forms of Enzyme-II<sup>Glc</sup>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="22"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In previous publications, we identified and partially characterized a novel form of the Enzyme II complexes of the bacterial phosphotransferase system, PTS, which both transports and phosphorylates its substrates in a single phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)-dependent step. The novel form of these enzyme complexes proved to be localized to the cytoplasm of the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell and differed in properties from the previously characterized and more abundant membrane integrated complexes <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The membrane-integrated form proved to be dimeric while the soluble form was monomeric <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These two fractions could be easily separated by gel filtration where Peak 1 (the dimer) appeared in the void volume while Peak 2 (the monomer) was included.</p><p>All PTS Enzymes II have been shown to catalyze two vectorial reactions, the unidirectional PEP-dependent sugar phosphorylation reaction and a bidirectional transphosphorylation reaction in which the phosphoryl motiety of an intracellular sugar phosphate is transferred to an incoming radioactive sugar present initially extracytoplasmically <xref rid="pone.0024088-Saier1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Saier2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this reaction, uptake of the radioactive sugar is coupled to the export of the sugar motiety of the intracellular sugar-phosphate in intact cells <xref rid="pone.0024088-Saier2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The PTS can phosphorylate sugars in both vectorial and non-vectorial reactions <xref rid="pone.0024088-Saier3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Leonard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

The purified protein also exists in the two states (soluble and membrane integrated), and <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions that allow the interconversion of these two forms have been identified.

We also compare the phospholipid (PL) contents (phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL)), showing that the soluble forms of II<sup>Glc</sup> have a higher anionic PL content than the membranes. The results clearly suggest that the soluble II<sup>Glc</sup> is present in a micellar structure, and that there are intermediate states between the monomeric micellar structure and the fully membrane integrated dimeric bilayer structure, one of which appears to be a larger dimeric micelle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>

<italic>In vitro</italic> FRET analysis of MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP/MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP mixtures</title><p>
<italic>Intra- and interactions between peaks 1 and 2.</italic> Protein-protein interactions of II<sup>Glc</sup> in gel filtration peaks 1 and 2 of the 2 h HSS of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21DE3(pMAL-<italic>ptsG-cfp</italic>) and BL21DE3(pMAL-<italic>ptsG-yfp</italic>) were studied by FRET analyses. The MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP was excited at 436 nm where emission at 488 nm can be absorbed by MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP. The excitation of YFP resulted in emission at 526 nm. The purified protein sample in the elution buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02022;HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM maltose) was contained in a 100 &#x000b5;l quartz cuvette. Measurements were carried out in a spectrofluorometer [Fluorolog-3 (FL 3&#x02013;22), Jobin yvon Inc. (Horiba group)] with a 2.5 or 3.5 slit for both excitation and emission. For detection of FRET and protein-protein interactions, the following samples were examined: (i) CFP fused protein plus YFP fused protein from either peak 1 or peak 2 were mixed after purification, (ii) CFP fused protein plus YFP fused protein from either peak 1 or peak 2 were mixed, purified and then analyzed, (iii) CFP fused protein plus YFP fused protein from peak 1 were mixed, triton treated, purified and then analyzed, (iv) CFP fused protein plus YFP fused protein from peak 1 were separately purified, mixed, triton treated and then analyzed, (v) CFP fused protein from peak 2 plus YFP fused protein from peak 1 were mixed, purified and then analyzed. Detergent treatment was done using triton X100 at a final concentration of 0.1&#x00025; with stirring or shaking at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. In each case, CFP fused protein alone and YFP fused protein alone from the corresponding peak and in amounts equivalent to that present in the mixture under examination were similarly treated and analyzed. Enzyme purification was conducted by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin as described by <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa4" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Columns containing 12 ml of amylose resin were washed with 8 column volumes of buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02022;HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). After sample loading, each column was washed with 12 bed volumes of column buffer and eluted with column buffer containing 10 mM maltose. The pooled fractions were concentrated in an Amicon concentrator, 30,000 MWCO. The eluate was centrifuged using a fixed angle rotor at 6,000 rpm for 25 min. The concentrated samples of mixed or separate peaks were collected, and their protein concentrations were determined. The purified preparations were used for FRET analyses. The samples were excited at 436 nm, and the emission resulting in each case was monitored over the wave length range 440&#x02013;700 nm at 2 nm intervals. The apparent FRET efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensities at 526 and 476 nm.</p><p>
<italic>Verification of protein protein interactions between II<sup>Glc</sup> molecules of MBP-EII<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP and MBP-EII<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP fused proteins.</italic> This was carried out by testing: (i) the addition of un-labeled II<sup>Glc</sup>-MBP to different peak 1 mixes of MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP/MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP, (ii) the removal MBP by specific enzymatic digestion with factor Xa.</p><p>For (i), validation of the method was conducted by: (a) testing the interference of un-labeled II<sup>Glc</sup>-MBP (its separate effect on the emission of labeled MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP and MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP), (b) determining the concentration of II<sup>Glc</sup>-MBP which can be used without interference with the emission of reactants. A control experiment without un-labeled II<sup>Glc</sup>-MBP was carried in parallel. Peak 1 of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21DE3(pMALE-<italic>ptsG-cfp</italic>) was mixed with the Peak 1 fraction of BL21DE3(pMALE-<italic>ptsG-yfp</italic>) in the presence of unlabeled peak 1 of BL21DE3(pMALE-<italic>ptsG</italic>). Un-labeled peak 1 of BL21DE3(pMALE-<italic>ptsG</italic>) was similarly included in the separate test samples of CFP and YFP. The different mixtures produced were solubilized with Triton X100 and purified through an amylose column.</p><p>For (ii), digestion with factor Xa was carried out moderately or excessively. The digestion mixture contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM maltose. Factor Xa was added at 0.1 or 0.2 &#x000b5;g of enzyme protein per 1 &#x000b5;g of sample protein. The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature (23&#x000b0;C) for 12 and 34 h, then analyzed by 10&#x00025; SDS gel electrophoresis and FRET measurements. Digestion was also performed at 23&#x000b0;C for 3 days using 0.3 &#x000b5;g of enzyme per 1 &#x000b5;g of sample protein, and the digested samples were subjected to FRET analyses. Excessive digestion with factor Xa was carried out in two stages, the first stage with 0.3 &#x000b5;g of enzyme per 1 &#x000b5;g of sample protein for 3 days, and the second stage at 0.2 &#x000b5;g of enzyme per 1 &#x000b5;g of sample protein for a further 3 days. Digested samples were subjected to SDS PAGE which was carried out essentially as described by <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa4" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and FRET analyses.</p><p>
<italic>Processing and presentation of the data.</italic> Emission over the wavelength range 440&#x02013;700 nm for YFP alone was subtracted from that of the CFP plus YFP mixture. Then, the profile produced (termed corrected CFP) was plotted against the profile of CFP alone. In such cases, one can detect the change in the CFP profile in the CFP plus YFP mixture due to the presence of YFP. In positive FRET, one can see a decrease in the peak at 476&#x02013;488 nm and an increase in emission over the range around 526 nm. The ratio of emission at &#x003bb;476/emission at &#x003bb;526 for CFP alone and CFP in the CFP plus YFP mixture after subtraction of YFP (corrected CFP) were determined and compared. In positive FRET, a decrease in the ratio of the emission at &#x003bb;476/emission at &#x003bb;526 for the corrected CFP was observed as compared to that of CFP alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>

Paraformaldehyde (polymer of HCHO, Fisher company, used as a source of formaldehyde) was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline or distilled water to get a 4&#x00025; stock solution. To achieve solubility, NaOH pellets were added to a final pH of about 10.5.

<bold>Dynamic light scattering (DLS)</bold> is a technique used for measuring the size of molecules and particles undergoing Brownian motion by observing time-dependent fluctuations in the intensity of scattered light <xref rid="pone.0024088-Kaszuba1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In DLS, the sample is illuminated with a laser beam, and the intensity of the resulting scattered light produced by the particles fluctuates at a rate that is dependent upon the size of the particles. Analysis of these intensity fluctuations yields the diffusion coefficient of the particles and hence the particle size.

YidC has been identified as a factor that assists in the integration, folding, and assembly of IMPs, both in association with the Sec-translocon and separately. Our results suggest that this can also occur <italic>in vitro</italic> between the cytoplasmic form of II<sup>Glc</sup> and the bilayer dimeric membranous form of II<sup>Glc</sup>. In this regard <xref rid="pone.0024088-Mircheva1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> reported that the prokaryotic signal recognition particle receptor (SR) consists of FtsY and strikingly, although FtsY requires membrane contact for functionality, cell fractionation studies have localized FtsY predominantly to the cytosolic fraction of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. It has been suggested that the prokaryotic SR might bind the signal recognition particle-SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex (SRP-RNCs) already in the cytosol, and only then does it initiate membrane targeting. In their report <xref rid="pone.0024088-Angelini1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, showed that membrane protein targeting in bacteria is mediated by the signal recognition particle (SRP), FtsY and the bacterial SRP receptor (SR).

This could explain in part our observation of the interaction of the II<sup>Glc</sup> monomeric form with the membraneous form containing the FtsY mediator. However, this interaction may be a spontaneous, unassisted integration process. Further evidence for protein-protein interactions between II<sup>Glc</sup> monomers was obtained.</p><sec id="s3a1"><title>Testing the addition of un-labeled II<sup>Glc</sup>-MBP to different mixtures of MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP/MBP-II<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP</title><p>

<italic>In vivo</italic> cross linking caused a change in the relative distribution of cell lysate components (low speed pellets, high speed pellets and high speed supernatant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024088-g007">Figure 7</xref>). A decrease in the protein contents of these high speed supernatants was demonstrated by <italic>in vivo</italic> cross linking, and this decrease was proportional to the PFA concentration applied. On the other hand, an increase in the protein content was demonstrated in low and high speed pellets. Accordingly, PFA treatment of growing cells caused agglomeration of soluble proteins to give sedimentable proteins in both low and high speed centrifugation. Concerning enzymatic activity of II<sup>Glc</sup>, the transphosphorylation activities of the three cell lysate fractions (low speed pellets, high speed pellets and high speed supernatant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024088-g008">Figure 8</xref>) showed a dramatic reduction in the activities of low and high speed pellets, even at low PFA concentrations, while the high speed supernatant showed a lower reduction in activity which was proportional to the PFA concentration. This differential reduction in activity is attributed to the differential sensitivity of II<sup>Glc</sup> of the pellet fractions and that of the high speed supernatant. However, the lower II<sup>Glc</sup> activity of the high speed supernatant could be attributed to a comparable decrease in the protein contents of the HSS and/or to the action of PFA on II<sup>Glc</sup> activity <italic>per se</italic>.</p><fig id="pone-0024088-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0024088.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Effect of <italic>in vivo</italic> cross linking with different concentrations of paraformaldehyde (PFA) on the protein concentration of different preparations obtained from the cell lysate of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BW25113&#x00394;<italic>ptsG</italic>&#x00394;<italic>malE::km</italic>(pMALE-<italic>ptsG)</italic>.</title><p>Low speed pellets, white bars; high speed pellets, black bars; high speed supernatants, grey bars.

The same profile was obtained, skewed for the leading edge of Peak 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024088-g014">Figure 14</xref> (P1-A)), and skewed with a high intensity peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024088-g014">Figure 14</xref> (P1-B)).

However, when these same preparations were exposed to Triton X100 before purification, FRET emission spectra revealed excited state energy transfer. This indicates that the II<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP and II<sup>Glc</sup>-YFP fused proteins were in direct contact. Thus, detergent treatment of the stable dimeric mixed Peak 1 CFP and YFP fusion proteins followed by purification on an amylose resin must have caused dissociation to monomers and re-association to give mixed dimers.

The most reasonable interpretation is that the monomeric II<sup>Glc</sup> of peak 2 is stable, but exposure to the amylose resin causes these monomers to associate to dimers.

The pellet consists mostly of large tubular and vesicular structures characteristic of French Press disrupted <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes <xref rid="pone.0024088-DeLeij1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The enzyme must be in a dimeric form (as indicated by the strong substrate inhibition) in which it is very sensitive to formaldehyde inactivation. P1 proved to also contain a mixture of membranous vesicles and tubules, but more numerous smaller structures were also detected. Based on the NMR results (see below), it appears that many of these medium sized particles are present as dimeric micelles. These putative dimeric micelles predominate in the trailing edge of P1 while the larger membraneous particles (presumably membrane vesicles) were found largely in the leading edge of P1. P2 consists primarily of smaller particles, corresponding to the expected size of lipid containing monomeric micelles. These conclusions were substantiated by the substrate inhibition analyses that showed that pellet and P1 show strong and similar degrees of substrate inhibition while P2 showed none. Previous studies have established that only the dimeric species of a PTS Enzyme II complex exhibits this phenomenon <xref rid="pone.0024088-Saier1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Saier2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Saier5" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data</title><p>Studies using <sup>31</sup>P-NMR have proved of great value in understanding the problems of lipid polymorphism in biological membranes <xref rid="pone.0024088-Cullis1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and <sup>31</sup>P-NMR is a powerful tool that can be used to distinguish lipid bilayers from lipid micelles. When hydrated phospholipid samples are subjected to <sup>31</sup>P- NMR analysis under conditions of proton decoupling (a process which removes the dipolar interactions between protons and phosphorus nuclei) a variety of spectral lineshapes may be encountered. These spectra are sensitive indicators of the physical phase adopted by the lipids. The NMR results showed that as expected, pellet and P2 were present almost exclusively as bilayers and micelles, respectively. Surprisingly, however, P1 also contains substantial amounts of micelles especially in the trailing edge. This result was not expected, because the Enzyme assays had shown that P1-II<sup>Glc</sup> exhibited substrate inhibition (characteristic of the dimer), comparable to that of the pellet. This means that the micelles present in P1 were most likely dimeric. This report therefore provides the first evidence for dimeric micelles present in P1 but not in appreciable amounts in the pellet or P2.</p><p>Occasionally, the isotropic peak 2 spectrum shows an additional spectral component. Such a component was also observed by <xref rid="pone.0024088-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> for micellar spectra and were interpreted as representing a tubular lipid phase. Comparing the results obtained here with lipid analysis data, it can be mentioned that the micellar structure observed for P2 could be correlated with high anionic lipid (PG and CL) content in peak 2 material relative to its PE content. This suggests that a high (PG&#x0002b;CL)/PE ratio favors and stabilizes micellar structure over bilayer structure. Such a conclusion is supported by the following studies.</p><p>Kleinschmidt and Tamm <xref rid="pone.0024088-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> used solid-state <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectroscopy to determine the minimal chain lengths of some phospholipids that are required for the formation of lipid bilayers. They found that when the chemical shift anisotropies (CSAs) of lipids of the same chain length with different headgroups were compared, an increase of the CSA (i.e. shift to the anisotropic spectra of bilayers) occurred in the order, PG &#x0003c; PE &#x0003c; PC (phosphatidyl choline) &#x0003c; PS (phosphatidylserine). With the exception of PE, this order correlated with the increasing volumes of the lipid headgroups in this sequence. Accordingly, one would generally expect to observe more order (larger CSA) for larger headgroups. These investigators also noticed that the chain-length threshold for bilayer formation follows a different order of phospholipid classes, PE &#x0003c; PC &#x0003c; PS &#x0003c; PG. They reported that in addition to headgroup volume, headgroup charge appears to play an important role in explaining the micelle-to-bilayer transition. Charge repulsion drives negatively charged PGs to the micellar phase and thereby moves this lipid species to the right end of the sequence. The primary amine-containing headgroups of PE and PS can form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of neighboring lipids as demonstrated by crystallography <xref rid="pone.0024088-Hitchcock1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, infrared spectroscopy <xref rid="pone.0024088-Sen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and fluorescence spectroscopy <xref rid="pone.0024088-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Slater1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Hydrogen bonds can also be formed between the hydroxyl groups and the phosphate groups of phosphatidylglycerol molecules <xref rid="pone.0024088-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, but the negative charge remains effective as a repulsive force between PG molecules. The hydrogen-bonding interactions in PE and PS reduce the effective headgroup area and thereby stabilize the bilayer over the micellar structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Lipid and Protein Analyses</title><p>All fractions were measured for total lipid and total protein contents. The pellet fractions had the highest lipid to protein ratios while P2 had the lowest such ratio. This fact correlated with our earlier observation that phospholipids stimulate II<sup>Glc</sup> activity in P2 much more than P1 or pellet II<sup>Glc</sup> activity <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These observations taken together suggest that a lipid deficiency characterizes the monomeric micelles.</p><p>The micellar species proved to be enriched in anionic lipids, PG and CL, and deficient for the zwitterionic lipid, PE. This can be explained because II<sup>Glc</sup> (and other PTS Enzymes II) require a proper balance of PE versus PG&#x0002b;CL for optimal activity <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Aboulwafa5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, these enzymes exhibit depressed activity when either the anionic or the zwitterionic lipids are lowered from their natural amounts. The lower lipid to protein ratio in P2 may also contribute to the reduced activity of this preparation.</p><p>The physiological impact of micellar species being enriched in anionic lipids, PG and CL, may be of significance. Matsumoto <xref rid="pone.0024088-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> reported that anionic phospholipids recruit peripheral membrane proteins to the membrane by virtue of their negative charges. For example, <italic>E. coli</italic> peripheral membrane proteins such as SecA, FtsY, DnaA, PssA and HtrA (DegP) bind to negatively charged surfaces. In the case of SecA, FtsY, DnaA and PssA, their respective activities are dependent on their binding to major anionic phospholipids. Accordingly, binding of FtsY to the micellar II<sup>Glc</sup> form might facilitate its insertion in the membrane bilayer. This may be supported by the observation that precursor proteins such as prePhoE and proOmpA were transported (SecA-mediated translocation) across a PG-depleted membrane vesicle when supplemented with CL, PA, phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanol or phosphatidylinositol (PI), essentially to the same extent as PG-supplemented membranes <xref rid="pone.0024088-Lill1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Kusters1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The FtsY protein, an <italic>E. coli</italic> homologue of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic signal recognition particle receptor, is suggested as having a direct membrane targeting function in protein translocation. <italic>In vitro</italic>, FtsY protein associates efficiently with membrane vesicles containing 30&#x00025; anionic PG <xref rid="pone.0024088-deLeeuw1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. As in the case of SecA, the membrane association of FtsY is accompanied by a conformational change required for membrane association. After the proteins are recruited to the anionic surface of the membrane, they are inserted into the acyl chain region of the phospholipid bilayer <xref rid="pone.0024088-deLeeuw1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Ulbrandt1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024088-Kitchen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. These proteins are intimately associated with, and surrounded by, hydrophobic acyl chains of phospholipids.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Overview</title><p>The application of physical techniques (FRET, cryo-EM, DLS and NMR) together with standard biochemical approaches (formaldehyde crosslinking, enzyme activity measurements and phospholipid/protein determinations) allow us to come to novel conclusions and hypotheses regarding the nature of the various physical forms of II<sup>Glc</sup>.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>II<sup>Glc</sup> can exist in 3 distinct forms: a dimer in a bilayer, a dimer in a micelle, and a monomer in a smaller micelle.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Exchange of subunits within the dimer depends on the presence of detergent (Triton X100), but coalescing of monomeric micelles to form dimeric micelles can occur in the absence of detergent.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The dimer, previously shown to be required for sugar-P substrate inhibition, is also much more sensitive to inactivation by formaldehyde treatments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Formaldehyde inactivation appears to occur with equal efficiency when the dimer is present in a bilayer or micelle.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Particle size decreases in the expected order, pellet&#x0003e;P1&#x0003e;P2, but all preparations are heterogeneous, probably representing in part the ease of particle type interconversion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is an ideal method for distinguishing bilayers from micelles, and together with substrate inhibition results, its use allowed us to provide evidence for a previously unsuspected micellar dimeric II<sup>Glc</sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The different fractions have different phospholipid:protein ratios (pellet&#x0003e;P1&#x0003e;P2) and different phospholipid types, with the PE contents being pellet&#x0003e;P1&#x0003e;P2.</p></list-item></list><p>These advances put the structural features of monomeric and dimeric II<sup>Glc</sup> micelles on a firm basis and allow us to derive new questions that are subject to experimental examination.
