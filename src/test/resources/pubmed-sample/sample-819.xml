But their use exposes patients to adverse events in the medium and long term. Lipodystrophy syndrome is one of the main effects in the long term observed in patients treated with antiretroviral agents. Lipodystrophy is probably the result of the synergistic effect of several classes of medicinal products because some protease inhibitors (PI) inhibit adiposity differentiation and induce insulin resistance while some nucleoside inhibitors (NI) produce lipolysis and, under some conditions, apoptosis of adipocytes. The difference in sensitivity of peripheral and central adipocytes to these compounds may partly explain the redistribution of fat, keeping in mind that other mechanisms are probably involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Many cross-sectional studies have demonstrated the prevalence of lipodystrophy ranging from 18 to 80% in patients who received antiretroviral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is estimated that about 50% of patients develop lipodystrophy after one to two years of exposure to multiple drug therapy including a protease inhibiter (PI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The psychological impact of lipodystrophy is substantive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Physical changes, especially facial atrophy, stigmatise patients and affect compliance with therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and patient&#x02019;s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The success of antiretroviral therapy to a large extent is based on patient compliance with therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The Aproco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] cohort clearly demonstrated the relationship between lipodystrophy and non-compliance with therapy. It is therefore important to improve the impact of therapies on quality of life and consequently on compliance.</p><p>One method of managing facial lipoatrophy is to inject filler products. Two main types can be differentiated, permanent filler products and absorbable filler products. NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or L-Polylactic Acid is an absorbable filler product whose purpose is to produce progressive thickening of the dermis by deep intradermal injection. Its slow absorbability gives it an extended duration of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In France, L-polylactic acid (NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is a medical device which obtained a favourable opinion from the Commission for Evaluation of Products and Services (CEPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] for reimbursement in correction of facial lipoatrophy in HIV-positive patients treated with antiretroviral therapies. The impact of this treatment on patients&#x02019; quality of life has not previously been addressed.</p><p>The objectives of this study were four-fold: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The primary objective was to describe the impact of NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on the quality of life of patients treated with antiretroviral agents, using the lipodystrophy-specific ABCD quality of life self-questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The secondary objectives of this study were: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] to describe the efficacy of NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> based on photographs taken before the first injection, 2 months after the last injection session, and then, if applicable, 12 and 18 months after the last injection session; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] to describe overall efficacy of treatment with an &#x0201c;Overall Treatment Effect&#x0201d; (OTE) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] to contribute further data regarding the safety of NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the short, medium and long term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This was an observational, longitudinal, multicenter, open label study performed in France. The study followed patients during their usual care routine. Additional information pertaining to the study was asked for during usual care visits. It did not alter patients&#x02019; usual medical management nor affect their physical or psychological integrity nor require specific monitoring visits. A participation consent form was signed jointly by patient and investigating doctor. The study was approved by the Paris Ile de France 4 Ethics Committee, Paris, France. The study was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], with the French Data Processing and Liberties Law no 78.17 of 06.01.1978, received a favourable opinion from the CCTIRS (Consultative Committee on Data Processing in Research in the field of Health), and was authorised by CNIL (National Commission on Data Processing and Liberties).</p></sec><sec><title>Schedule</title><p>The first patient was included in April 2006 and the last in April 2007.

Investigating doctors were recruited from a list of all doctors trained in the injection technique who had treated at least one patient with NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. A total of 200 patients were recruited from the 13 centres and comprised the first 20 patients from each centre agreeing to participate in the study and who met eligibility criteria during a 6 month period.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion/non-inclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria were: men or women at least 18 years of age, HIV-seropositive, treated with antiretroviral therapy and for whom the doctor freely decided to use NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> to correct facial lipoatrophy, who agreed to participate in the study and who signed the consent form, with an adequate level of education to be able to fill out alone the self-questionnaires on evaluation of quality of life and overall efficacy of treatment. Non-inclusion criteria were: patients participating in another study with a similar product.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Patients completed the ABCD quality of life questionnaire before the first injection and then 2 months after the last session of injections and, if applicable, 12 to 18 months after the last session of injections. Concomitantly, the Overall Treatment Effect (OTE) scale was completed by patients 2 months after the last session of injections and 12 to 18 months after the last session of injections, if applicable*. Comparison of ABCD and OTE scores allowed calculation of the minimal important difference in overall ABCD quality of life score.</p><p>*As it was an observational study the 12/18 months evaluation took place only if the patient returned to a visit during this period in the setting of usual management</p><p>An expert committee (2 dermatologists, 1 plastic surgeon) graded photographs for lipoatrophy presence before the 1<sup>st</sup> injection, 2 months after the last session of injections and, if applicable, 12 to 18 months after the last session of injections. Safety was evaluated using side effect or adverse event data obtained from the Case Report Forms (CRF).</p><p>The <italic>Assessment of Body Change and Distress (ABCD) questionnaire</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] consist of three parts. Lipodystrophy: Six items concern the presence/absence of lipodystrophy in 6 areas of the body. The score is calculated by adding up the total number of responses (0 or 1) to the 6 items (0= no area affected 6 = 6 areas affected). Satisfaction: One 5-point item investigates overall satisfaction with body appearance (from 1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied). Quality of life: 21 items spread across four dimensions evaluate the impact of lipodystrophy on the patient&#x02019;s life; Dimension A: Control and adjustment to the illness, satisfaction with body appearance (9 items); Dimension B: Psychological, social and relational impact (7 items); Dimension C: Fear of the future (3 items); Dimension D: Impact of treatment (2 items). Note that this French ABCD questionnaire contains an additional item concerning surgery/aesthetic correction of lipodystrophy in Dimension B. Quality of life items were summed to form an overall QoL score (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha 0.89), t-transformed to range from 0 = worst possible QoL to 100 = best possible QoL.</p><p><italic>Lipoatrophy grading system</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]<italic>.</italic> For each patient, photographic slides (each containing 3 views: 1 front, 1 right side, 1 left side) were submitted to a committee of 3 experts in random order, blinded (before treatment/after treatment or after treatment/before treatment), and without indication of the injection site. The experts rated the presence of lipoatrophy in each photo according to a grading system which differentiates 4 stages of lipoatrophy: Grade 1: corresponds to limited lipoatrophy, localised to the face. The appearance is almost normal. Grade 2: corresponds to deeper lipoatrophy. Some muscles begin to be visible, in particular the zygomatic. Grade 3: the affected area is no longer localised solely to the cheeks but is also deeper and wider. The muscles are increasingly visible. Grade 4: the most serious condition, also shows damage to the orbits. In this study, Grade 0 (no lipoatrophy) was added to the grading system. Photographs of patients were classified into one of 5 stages before treatment and then again classified at the visit at 2 months after treatment and at 12&#x02013;18 months after treatment.</p><p>The <italic>Overall Treatment Effect (OTE) scale</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] is a global rating of change scale. It comprises a single item on which patients rate the overall effect of treatment on their condition on a 15-point scale, where &#x02212;7 = condition greatly worsened, 0 = no change, +7 = condition greatly improved.</p><p><italic>Adverse events</italic> likely to be associated with injection of NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were classified as follows: &#x0201c;immediate&#x0201d; adverse events, such as bleeding, redness at the injection site, pain, ecchymosis and facial oedema. These coincided to time of injection. &#x0201c;Non-immediate&#x0201d; adverse events, such as nodules and/or indurated areas, granulomas, inflammation, discolouration, allergic reactions, coetaneous hypertrophy and atrophy. Clinically, they were of late onset. They are difficult to attribute to a particular session of injections because they can result from successive effect of several sessions of injections. When an adverse event was not an expected event (in conformity with the product leaflet), it was classified as &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; and entered according to the doctors verbatim.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 8.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Data were described in terms of sample size, mean, standard error, percentage by modality, response, and number of missing data, pre- (time 1) and post-treatment (time 2: 2 months; time 3: 12&#x02013;18 months). Evaluation of quality of life was performed based on a score calculated according to recommendations of the ABCD questionnaire. Wilcoxon t-tests were used to determine the significance of within-group changes over time in QoL component scores between the inclusion or pre-treatment visit (time 1) and post-treatment visits (time 2, time 3). Determination of the minimal important difference in quality of life was derived from calculation of the pre-treatment (time 1) and post-treatment (time 2, time 3) change in QoL score that corresponded with an OTE rating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] of a condition &#x02018;a little improved&#x02019; or &#x02018;somewhat improved&#x02019;. Evaluation of photographs pre- (time 1) and post-treatment (times 2,3) were performed by a committee of experts according to the scale for classification of lipoatrophy. Frequency of reported side effects were calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Participant data collected from 230 patients between April 2006 and February 2009 were analysed. Patient characteristics are shown in Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Patients were 47.4 years of age on average. Eighty-seven percent of participants were male. The average duration of HIV infection was around 16 years and time since initiation of anti-retroviral therapy was 11.2 years. Time since diagnosis of facial lipoatrophy was 5 years. Previous treatment of facial lipoatrophy was found in 39.4% of patients (NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in 75% of cases).

Concerns about HIV treatment reduced, as did fears for the future. Psychological, social and relational aspects of quality of life were especially improved, as was satisfaction with body appearance. Heightened scores on the latter QoL dimensions demonstrate the value of having used a condition-specific QoL instrument to assess the impact of condition-targeted treatment. These dimensions, encompassing intrapersonal and interpersonal stigma and appearance, are most indicative of lipoatrophy QoL effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] while HIV treatment concerns and future fears relate to HIV QoL more generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similar studies using generic QoL measures such as the SF-36 have sometimes failed to find significant treatment gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], while others have failed to show QoL differences between patients with and without lipodystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. On the other hand, studies using the ABCD have reported comparable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Patient-reported QoL improvements corresponded with doctor ratings of lipoatrophy reductions in facial disfigurement and musculature visibility observed in patient photos at three time intervals. Approximately half of patients saw their lipoatrophy decrease by at least one grade, and a quarter decreased by two grades between visits at 2 months and 12&#x02013;18 months. Previous studies of the impact of absorbable injection therapies [e.g. polyactic acid (PLA)] have also shown convergence between patient-reported QoL improvements and clinician-reported improvements in lipoatrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This convergence of views differs from some studies in which surgery has been the treatment of choice, and in which clinicians reported surgical success while patients reported significant QoL issues arising from post-surgery complications. Moreover, comparative studies have shown greater patient-reported QoL gains resulting from reabsorbable (PLA) and non-reabsorbable [e.g. polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG)] filler injections when compared to autologous fat transfer (AFT) surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This speaks to the value of including both patient and doctor perspectives as a method of evaluating condition improvement, and to the use of filler injection techniques as the treatment of choice.</p><p>Patient ratings of the overall treatment effect were positive in all cases, with most declaring a moderate improvement. No patient mentioned deterioration in condition as a result of treatment. A within subject change of 2&#x02013;3 points in overall treatment effect (&#x02018;a little improved&#x02019; or &#x02018;somewhat improved&#x02019;) equated with approximately 7 points change in ABCD quality of life score, indicating the minimal clinically important difference threshold for the ABCD QoL scale. Thresholds were determined for changes in ABCD QoL score for short and longer-term follow-up assessment (2 and 18 months), and for determining moderate and major important differences. With this knowledge, treating health professionals can easily and effectively monitor the magnitude of impact of a lipoatrophy treatment without the interpretive ambiguity typically associated with other QoL instruments. Furthermore, clinicians need not rely upon expensive and complicated diagnostic procedures and equipment to assess the need for patient intervention.</p><p>In this study, the primary criterion to assess the impact of lipoatrophy was the subjective perception of patients. It can be seen that this criterion is extremely useful in the clinical assessment of need for lipoatrophy correction, and may be a better indicator of treatment need than medical assessment procedures commonly used in clinical trials such as DEXA scan, bioimpedance or sonography. For instance low sensitivity poses a problem for the use of sonography to detect LD in the clinical routine as a single exam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Treatment safety data concur with the findings of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Immediate adverse events were reported by around 8% of patients, with ecchymosis, pain and skin redness being the most common. Non-immediate events affected around 7% of patients, with nodules and inflammation being the most frequently reported. These essentially mild and transient events, coupled with significant QoL gains and visible lipoatrophy improvements, speak to the value of preferencing cosmetic filler therapy over surgery for which there are greater immediate risks such as disfigurement, expertise required, lack of long-term safety data, and limits to whom surgery is applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In terms of clinical value, compliance with anti-retroviral therapy may well improve with the use of NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The success of ART is largely based on patient compliance with therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and lipodystrophy diminishes compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As shown here, improvements to lipoatrophy occurred following NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment in ways that were meaningful and recognisable to both doctor and patient.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>One limitation is the observational design of the study. Improvement in QoL may not solely be attributed to treatment. However, spontaneous improvement of lipoatrophy does not occur. Consistent patient improvements observed in the photographs add weight to the validity of the results. Moreover, the efficacy of polyactic acid when compared to other treatments has been shown in several previous comparative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A second limitation is the loss of patients to followup, though data available indicated that those lost had similar demographics and treatment outcomes in the early stages to those retained in the later stage. Thirdly, most participants were male hence the findings best represent the treatment experience of men rather than women. A fourth limitation is the use of a single-item measure to establish MID. The reliability of a single item global measure of change is low, and it is strongly influenced by the present state and only weekly by the initial state. Others studies have used multiple item measures, effect size, and combined clinical-patient ratings of overall treatment effect for MID calculation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the results demonstrated an improvement in quality of life scores as well as a favourable change in visual grade of lipoatrophy between inclusion visit and monitoring visit at 2 months post-NEW-FILL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment.
