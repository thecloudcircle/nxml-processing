As a natural consequence, spikes emitted by microcircuits are also nonrandomly patterned in time and space. One of the prominent spike organizations is a repetition of fixed patterns of spike series across multiple neurons. However, several questions remain unsolved, including how precisely spike sequences repeat, how the sequences are spatially organized, how many neurons participate in sequences, and how different sequences are functionally linked. To address these questions, we monitored spontaneous spikes of hippocampal CA3 neurons <italic>ex vivo</italic> using a high-speed functional multineuron calcium imaging (fMCI) technique that allowed us to monitor spikes with millisecond resolution and to record the location of spiking and non-spiking neurons. Multineuronal spike sequences (MSSs) were overrepresented in spontaneous activity compared to the statistical chance level. Approximately 75% of neurons participated in at least one sequence during our observation period. The participants were sparsely dispersed and did not show specific spatial organization. The number of sequences relative to the chance level decreased when larger time frames were used to detect sequences. Thus, sequences were precise at the millisecond level. Sequences often shared common spikes with other sequences; parts of sequences were subsequently relayed by following sequences, generating complex chains of multiple sequences.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>spontaneous activity</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>action potentials</kwd><kwd>spike sequences</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>ripple</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="7683"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain uses a limited number of neurons to process virtually unlimited patterns of information from external environments. Therefore, individual neurons are unlikely to independently process specific information, and it is more plausible that they cooperatively form subgroups that work as functional units. This idea, called the &#x0201c;cell assembly&#x0201d; hypothesis (Hebb, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1949</xref>; Harris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2005</xref>; Buzsaki, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2010</xref>), leads to two important predictions about neuronal circuit operation. First, a given neuron can participate in two or more cell assemblies. Second, the synapse weight between two given neurons is modifiable over time. More specifically, the weight is strengthened when the neurons work cooperatively, otherwise it is weakened. This bidirectional synaptic plasticity has been experimentally proven by studies showing that cortical synapses are capable of exhibiting long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. These two features suggest that neuronal networks self-organize through reorganization of neuronal connectivity due to ongoing external stimuli and are thereby functionally compartmentalized to form cell assemblies.</p><p>Synchronous activity among multiple neurons is regarded as one of the simplest aspects of cell assembly dynamics, not only because it triggers the induction of synaptic plasticity but also because it is realized through synchronization between groups of presynaptic neurons (Takahashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2010</xref>). At a more microscopic level, synchronized activity is often composed of sequential activation of multiple neurons. Indeed, such multineuronal spike sequences (MSSs) are known to exist during sensory-evoked and spontaneous network activity at frequencies greater than chance (Abeles and Gerstein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1988</xref>; Prut et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1998</xref>; Abeles and Gat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2001</xref>; Ikegaya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>; Luczak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>). MSSs are conceptually consistent with the so-called &#x0201c;synfire chains&#x0201d; hypothesis, in which neurons form several layers through which synchronized spikes can stably propagate with temporal precision, therefore generating a chain of spikes across neurons (Abeles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1991</xref>). Although MSSs have been reported in different brain preparations, including the neocortex of monkeys and rodents <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, some reports still cast doubt on the existence of MSSs (Oram et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1999</xref>; Baker and Lemon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2000</xref>; Mokeichev et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2007</xref>).</p><p>We focus the present work on the hippocampus. One of the reasons for this selection is that the hippocampus spontaneously emits sharp waves-ripples (SW-Rs), a transient form of high-frequency field oscillations. SW-Rs primarily occur during slow-wave sleep and quiet awake states (Buzsaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1983</xref>). During SW-Rs, neurons that were previously involved in behavioral exploration, called place cells, increase their firing rates sequentially in the same or opposite order of which those neurons were activated during the behavioral exploration (Lee and Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2002</xref>; Harris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>; Foster and Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2006</xref>; O'Neill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>; Diba and Buzsaki, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2007</xref>; Pastalkova et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2008</xref>; Davidson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>). Therefore, the hippocampus may be a good model to study MSSs. <italic>In vitro</italic> slices prepared from the hippocampus are also reported to emit spontaneous SW-Rs (Norimoto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2012</xref>; Sun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2012</xref>), and the slices may produce MSSs. If it were the case, it would be easy to analyze the properties of MSSs because the <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental system is more accessible and manipulatable than the <italic>in vivo</italic> system.</p><p>Functional multineuron calcium imaging (fMCI) is an optical technique that monitors spikes of neurons <italic>in situ</italic> through spike-evoked somatic calcium transients. We have optimized the method for hippocampal slice cultures (Takahashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2011</xref>). In the CA3 region of organotypically cultured slices, the probability of a synaptic connection between randomly selected adjacent pyramidal cells is approximately 25%. This ratio is higher than that reported in acute slice preparations (2&#x02013;8%) (Miles and Wong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1983</xref>; Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1995</xref>). In acute hippocampal slices, however, 75&#x02013;90% of the axons of CA3 pyramidal neurons are cut, even in slices as thick as 500 &#x003bc;m (Gomez-Di Cesare et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1997</xref>). In contrast, cultured networks self-restore their complexity to a realistic extent. Indeed, levels of spontaneous excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents are similar between <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> hippocampal neurons (Takahashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2010</xref>). Moreover, we have demonstrated, by using an optical synapse mapping technique, that in such restored CA3 networks, pyramidal cells are nonrandomly connected to generate diverse repertoires of synchronized activity, like the <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions (Takahashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animal</title><p>Experiments were performed with the approval of the animal experiment ethics committee at the University of Tokyo (approval number: 19-43, P21-6) according to the University of Tokyo guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Slice culture preparations</title><p>Entorhino-hippocampal organotypic slices were prepared from 7-day-old Wistar/ST rats (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) as previously described (Koyama et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2007</xref>). Briefly, rat pups were anesthetized by hypothermia and decapitated. The brains were removed and placed in aerated, ice-cold Gey's balanced salt solution supplemented with 25 mM glucose. Horizontal entorhino-hippocampal slices were made at a thickness of 300 &#x003bc;m using a vibratome (DTK-1500, Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan). The slices were placed on Omnipore membrane filters (JHWP02500, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C. The culture medium, which was composed of 50% minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 25% Hanks' balanced salt solution, 25% horse serum (Cell Culture Laboratory, Cleveland, OH, USA), and antibiotics, was changed every 3.5 days. Experiments were performed on days 7&#x02013;11 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Although slice cultures are known to form abnormal connections that very rarely exist under normal conditions, such as CA1-to-CA1, CA1-to-CA3, and CA3-to-dentate gyrus connections (Gahwiler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1997</xref>; De Simoni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003</xref>), there are few of these aberrant connections in our slice culture preparations. Investigation using reverse optical trawling, a synapse mapping technique (Sasaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2009</xref>), demonstrated that these abnormal connections are less than 0.5% of the total connections and that an overwhelming number of connections project to their normal targets. This result is most likely because the entorhinal cortex was not dissected out in our preparations. Lesions of the entorhinal cortex are known to result in abnormal sprouting and reorganization of hippocampal networks <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> (Laurberg and Zimmer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1981</xref>; West and Dewey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">1984</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional multineuron calcium imaging</title><p>Slices were incubated with 2 ml of dye solution at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h (Takahashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2011</xref>). The dye solution was aCSF containing 0.0005% Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1AM (OGB-1AM), 0.01% Pluronic F-127, and 0.005% Cremophor EL. After a 1-h recovery, a slice was transferred to a recording chamber. Images were acquired at 500 frames/s with a Nipkow-disk confocal unit (CSUX-1, Yokogawa Electric, Tokyo, Japan), a back-illuminated electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) camera (iXon DV860, Andor, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK), a water-immersion objective lens (16&#x000d7;, 0.80 NA, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and Solis software (Andor). Fluorophores were excited at 488 nm with an argon laser (10&#x02013;15 mW, 532-BS-AO4, Omnichrome, Chino, CA, USA) and visualized with a 507-nm long-pass emission filter. In each cell body, the fluorescence change &#x00394;F/F was calculated as (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>)/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, where <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is the fluorescence intensity at frame time <italic>t</italic>, and <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> is baseline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Spike timing was defined as the onset of individual calcium transients with an automatic machine-learning algorithm that can accurately detect spike timing within one frame jitter (Sasaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2008</xref>). In some experiments, picrotoxin was bath-applied to prevent fast inhibitory synaptic transmission. Picrotoxin (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in aCSF at the final concentration of 50 &#x003bc;M and perfused to slices. Imaging was started 30 min after the perfusion onset.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>High-speed fMCI of spontaneous CA3 network activity. (A)</bold>

Glass pipettes were filled with 2 M NaCl and placed in CA1 stratum pyramidale. To extract the SW-R activity, the recorded data were band-pass filtered at 150&#x02013;300 Hz. SW-R-like events were automatically detected based on their oscillatory powers and durations; the root mean square (3-ms window) of the band-passed signal was used to detect SW-Rs of 10 ms duration with a power threshold of 5 standard deviations (SDs).</p></sec><sec><title>MSS detection</title><p>We used a template-matching algorithm to search for MSSs (Ikegaya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>). We first selected cells that showed more than one calcium transient. After determining the reference calcium levels of a reference cell (<italic>cell</italic><sub>1</sub>), we designated a vector consisting of a set of cells and relative timings of their calcium events as follows: (<italic>cell</italic><sub>2</sub>, &#x02026;, <italic>cell</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>3</sub>,&#x02026;, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>), where <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> denotes the delay of the event in <italic>cell</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> after the reference event. <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> was limited to less than 500 ms. This vector was used as a template and was slid along the successive events of <italic>cell</italic><sub>1</sub> throughout the recording session. If more than two elements were identical between any template pairs, we regarded the matched elements as an MSS. Each mismatched spike configuration was used as another template in a subsequent scan. Thus, every event was considered part of a template MSS, and each template occurred at least once. Unless otherwise specified, one frame jitter (2 ms) was allowed so that the total number of MSSs satisfied statistical demands (Kendall et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Surrogate data</title><p>To determine whether MSSs or their structures can arise from a stochastic process, we created surrogate raster plots using a Monte Carlo resampling method (Ikegaya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>). Each calcium event was exchanged between a pair of cells, maintaining their relative timings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This procedure was repeated for all calcium transients in each raster plot. This randomization preserves the event frequencies of individual cells and the population modulation of event timings, such as network synchronization. In each shuffled surrogate, we searched MSSs using the same detection algorithm. Twenty surrogates were generated for each dataset, and the averages across the 20 surrogates were defined as the chance level.</p></sec><sec><title>Asynchrony index</title><p>The temporal sparseness of network activity during the observation period was captured by a normalized Shannon index, termed asynchrony index (Usami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2008</xref>; Mizunuma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>; Ujita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2011</xref>). The Shannon index quantifies the dispersion of components in a histogram and is generally defined as &#x02212;&#x02211;<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>/K) <italic>log</italic><sub>2</sub> (k<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>/K), where <italic>K</italic> is the total number of components, and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the number of components in the <italic>i</italic>-th bin. This definition of diversity is conceptually equivalent to Shannon's entropy. Because this index is sensitive to <italic>K</italic> and the bin size, SI has often been normalized with the maximal value and other standard values to compare groups. Here we normalized Shannon index with the maximal (<italic>SI</italic>max) and minimal values (<italic>SI</italic>min) that can be taken in the distribution of the same number of spikes in the raster plot. <italic>SI</italic>max and <italic>SI</italic>min were obtained through data shuffle with maintaining <italic>K</italic> and bin; <italic>SI</italic>max is given when components are as evenly redistributed over the time axis as possible, whereas <italic>SI</italic>min is given when components are as temporally biased as possible. Then normalized Shannon index is defined as <italic>(SI&#x02013;SI</italic>min)/(<italic>SI</italic>max&#x02013;<italic>SI</italic>min). Thus, it takes a value from 0 to 1, with higher values being more dispersive.</p></sec><sec><title>Data representation</title><p>We reported all averaged values as the mean &#x000b1; SDs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>High-speed imaging of spiking CA3 networks <italic>ex vivo</italic></title><p>Hippocampal slice cultures were incubated in OGB1AM, and OGB1-loaded neurons were imaged from the CA3 stratum pyramidale at 500 Hz using a spinning-disk confocal microscope and a high-speed EM-CCD camera (Takahashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2011</xref>). The microscopic field covered an area of approximately 350 &#x000d7; 200 &#x003bc;m (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and contained an average of 91.7 &#x000b1; 26.7 neurons (mean &#x000b1; SD of 9 videos, ranging from 60 to 137 neurons). Each video was 130 s in length, and a total of 9 videos were recorded from 9 slices (<italic>n</italic> = 9 rat pups borned from 9 mothers).</p><p>In all 9 videos, spontaneous activity was evident; among a total of 825 neurons in 9 videos, 757 neurons (91.8%) exhibited at least one spike during the observation period. The mean firing rates of active neurons were 0.25 &#x000b1; 0.29 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 9 videos), ranging from 0.008 to 2.33 Hz. Therefore, spontaneous activity was sparse as a whole. Nevertheless, neurons occasionally exhibited synchronization at the population level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>); synchronization that recruited more than 5% or 10% of the total neurons occurred at frequencies of 2.46 &#x000b1; 3.0 or 0.26 &#x000b1; 0.52 per min, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 9 videos, bin = 2 ms = one frame).</p><p>We succeeded in simultaneous LFP recording in one single video; note that in general, LFP recording is technically difficult in slice cultures, most likely because neurite reorganization during cultivation slightly alters the fine layer structure of the hippocampus, collapsing the net dipole moment generated by synaptic activity or because cultured networks may be heterogenous from preparation to preparation (e.g., see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In the single dataset, we found that synchronous activity was always accompanied by SW-R-like high-frequency oscillations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, inset).</p></sec><sec><title>MSSs with millisecond precision</title><p>We detected MSSs.

Not surprisingly, the number of MSSs depended on the spike time jitters allowed to detect MSSs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> left).

The total number of MSSs in each video (2-ms jitter allowed) was plotted against the total number of neurons recorded in the corresponding videos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), the mean activity frequency of those neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), and the asynchrony index of the corresponding videos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>); note that the asynchrony index is a normalized Shannon index for spike dispersion along the time axis (Usami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2008</xref>; Mizunuma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>; Ujita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2011</xref>). Thus, we investigated the statistical significance of MSSs by comparing the number of MSSs to its stochastic level. To estimate the stochastic level, we created surrogate raster plots by randomly exchanging spikes across neurons. Specifically, a single spike of a randomly selected neuron was swapped with a spike of another randomly selected neuron without changing their absolute spike timings, and this swapping procedure was repeated until all spikes in the original dataset were exchanged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> right, inset). This shuffling method preserved both the firing rates of individual neurons and the level and frequency of network synchronization. Therefore, comparing an original dataset with these surrogates makes it possible to examine whether MSSs are actively generated by complex network dynamics or are merely a mathematically natural consequence of the firing rates of individual neurons.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Across-video variations of the number of MSSs</bold>.

The CV rapidly decreased as a function of the number of surrogates; it dropped to about 0.05 by 20 surrogates, and thereafter, it was kept almost constant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, 2-ms jitter allowed). To reduce computation burden with preserving statistical stability, therefore, we searched MSSs in 20 surrogates generated from each raster plot. MSSs in the surrogates also increased in number with spike jitter timing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> right). We thus plotted the ratio of the MSS number in the real dataset to that in the surrogates as a function of jitters. The ratio peaked at a jitter of 0 ms and decreased gradually with increasing jitters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). We repeated this procedure for all other datasets and found similar results in the pooled data (<italic>n</italic> = 9 videos; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), that is, the mean real-to-surrogate ratio is a simple reduction function of spike jitters. Based on these results, we reached two fundamental conclusions: (1) MSSs emerge more frequently than expected by chance and therefore cannot be explained by a stochastic process, and (2) relative spike times within MSSs are maintained at the millisecond level.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Millisecond precision of MSSs</bold>.

To enhance statistical accuracy, we selected the 2-ms jitter in this study. Note that the MSS properties described below were fundamentally consistent and exhibited similar tendencies at jitters of 0, 2, 4, and 8 ms (data not shown).</p><p>At a jitter of 2 ms, we identified a total of 27,804 MSSs in 9 videos.

Our spike shuffling method did not consider the spatial organization of cells that participated in MSSs. We thus created surrogates using another shuffling method; for each MSS, spikes were preserved for only one MSS appearance, while the other spikes constituting the MSS were randomly exchanged within the MSS. This procedure did not collapse the spatial organization of cells that exhibited MSSs. Using this shuffling method, we again confirmed that MSSs were overrepresented relative to chance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 9 videos). However, because these Monte Carlo-shuffling evaluations did not completely abolish statistically innate problems, such as false-negative errors and false-positive errors, we also adopted a completely different approach to validate MSSs without spike shuffling; MSSs are embossed in pairwise correlograms among spike triplets occurring across three distinct cells (Luczak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>). For each cell trio, one cell was designated the trigger for calculation of the joint distribution of spike times of the other two (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>).

The histogram revealed that the neuronal network transiently increased the global firing rate during MSSs.

Bath application of picrotoxin reduced MSSs, as compared to control solution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>).

We also defined a core pattern as shared spikes at each relay step of a MSS chain. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12A</xref> shows an example MSS chain in which three MSSs were relayed (from blue to red and from red to green) through two core patterns (indicated by arrows). Of 27,804 MSSs in 9 videos, 22,234 MSSs (80.0%) contained at least one core pattern.

Single videos included 26.1 &#x000b1; 11.6 independent MSS chains (<italic>n</italic> = 9 videos). Single MSS chains consisted of 86.5 &#x000b1; 284.3 MSSs, contained 53.6 &#x000b1; 158.1 relay steps, and were 7.9 &#x000b1; 4.4 s in length (<italic>n</italic> = 234 chains).</p><p>Relay steps did not always reflect simple relays between MSSs. The steps often exhibited divergent relays, in which core patterns in one MSS were subsequently used in two or more MSSs, or convergent relays, in which core patterns in two or more MSSs were simultaneously used in a subsequent MSS (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12B</xref>). Single chains contained 17.8 &#x000b1; 56.6 divergent relays and 19.8 &#x000b1; 61.7 convergent relays (<italic>n</italic> = 234 chains), suggesting that MSS chains constitute MSS subgroups. Therefore, based on core patterns between MSSs, we analyzed MSSs using Ward's method. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12C</xref> depicts a dendrogram of MSSs in a representative video, indicating that MSSs were clustered into subgroups. Similar MSS cliqueness was observed in the other videos. As a whole, therefore, MSSs are not mere repetitions of precise firing patterns within specific sets of neurons, but they are parts of larger complex and flexible network dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we used fMCI with 2 ms temporal resolution and monitored CA3 network activity in cultured hippocampal slices. We searched MSSs using a template-matching method and analyzed them by comparing them to surrogates. We generated the surrogates using a spike-exchanging shuffling procedure, a randomization method that is believed to most reliably minimize false-positive errors because it does not collapse the firing rates of individual neurons or population modulation. We demonstrated that the temporal precision of MSSs in the hippocampus is high at the millisecond level. MSSs consisted of heterogeneous neurons or neuronal subsets. Moreover, we found core patterns across multiple MSSs, and the core patterns served as hubs through which MSSs are replaced with other MSSs and are sometimes split or joined together with other MSSs.</p><p>MSS-like fixed firing patterns have been reported in the neocortex of monkeys and rats (Abeles and Gerstein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1988</xref>; Aertsen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">1991</xref>; Abeles et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1993</xref>; Prut et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1998</xref>; Mao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2001</xref>; Cossart et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2003</xref>; Shmiel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2006</xref>; Luczak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>). They have been thought to be experimental evidence supporting the synfire chain hypothesis, a theoretical framework for efficient spike propagation; however, the statistical significance of MSSs has been questioned by several studies (Oram et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2001</xref>; Baker and Lemon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2000</xref>; Mokeichev et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2007</xref>). In this work, we simultaneously monitored spikes of approximately 100 neurons and confirmed that MSSs occurred in spontaneous activity more than chance. Importantly, the existence of MSSs was most significant at a spike jitter of zero frames. Thus, MSSs were repeated with spike precision of less than 2 ms. However, it is statistically difficult to find the true null hypothesis of temporal structures of spikes (Luczak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>). Therefore, we also tried to demonstrate the existence of MSSs by examining the properties of MSS-participating neurons. If MSSs are a stochastic product, neurons or neuron pairs with higher firing rates would be expected to participate more frequently in MSSs. Conversely, we found that, in the ratio scale, neurons with lower firing rates contributed more to MSSs. This result implies that MSSs are generated by network dynamics independent of the firing rates of individual neurons. Moreover, the number of neurons involved in single MSSs and the MSS length peaked at 6 neurons and 60 ms. These data also suggest that MSSs reflect organized network dynamics.</p><p>The majority of MSSs were generated by specific sets of neurons. Similar heterogeneous participations have been suggested by multi-electrode array recordings from cultures of dissociated mouse neocortical neurons (Sun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2010</xref>). In this work, we further identified the core patterns that mediated MSS relays. The core patterns seemed to serve as hubs that generated a wide variety of MSSs that were dynamically associated with each other. The clustering of MSSs in the dendrogram suggests that single cells participate in different MSSs and that single MSSs are also involved in larger-scale MSS chains. This &#x0201c;MSS-family&#x0201d; concept is consistent with cell assembly dynamics and also with phase sequences of synfire chains, both of which occur together with network synchronization. However, the complexity of MSSs must be interpreted with caution. For instance, the mean number of neurons involved in single MSSs was 3.4. The mean number of total neurons monitored simultaneously was 91.7, whereas approximately 5000 CA3 neurons exist in a hippocampal slice culture (Kimura et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>). This result means that we missed the vast majority of MSSs. Therefore, we underestimate both the true MSS size and the true complexity of MSS dynamics.</p><p>Although MSSs are theoretically accepted to be important for stable spike propagation through neuronal microcircuits that consist of weak and stochastic synapses (Abeles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1991</xref>; Diesmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1999</xref>; Reyes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2003</xref>), the physiological roles of MSSs in brain function remain unclear. Our work did not address this fundamental question, but it is intriguing to find that MSSs occurred during SW-Rs. We believe that MSSs underlie memory replay during SW-Rs. Manipulations of MSSs, i.e., artificial controls to increase or decrease MSSs, will help our understanding of the behavioral function of MSSs.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Science Research on Innovative Areas, &#x0201c;Mesoscopic Neurocircuitry&#x0201d; (No. 22115003), from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and by the Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (LS023).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abeles</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1991</year>). <source>Corticonics: Neural Circuits of the Cerebral Cortex</source>. <publisher-loc>Cambridge, MA</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Cambridge University Press</publisher-name>
