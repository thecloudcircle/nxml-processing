Although the disease's etiology is not fully understood, it is thought to involve a non&#x02013;cell-autonomous mechanism and alterations in RNA metabolism. Here, we identified reduced levels of miR126-5p in presymptomatic ALS male mice models, and an increase in its targets: axon destabilizing Type 3 Semaphorins and their coreceptor Neuropilins. Using compartmentalized <italic>in vitro</italic> cocultures, we demonstrated that myocytes expressing diverse ALS-causing mutations promote axon degeneration and NMJ dysfunction, which were inhibited by applying Neuropilin1 blocking antibody. Finally, overexpressing miR126-5p is sufficient to transiently rescue axon degeneration and NMJ disruption both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying ALS pathology, in which alterations in miR126-5p facilitate a non&#x02013;cell-autonomous mechanism of motor neuron degeneration in ALS.</p><p><bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</bold> Despite some progress, currently no effective treatment is available for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We suggest a novel regulatory role for miR126-5p in ALS and demonstrate, for the first time, a mechanism by which alterations in miR126-5p contribute to axon degeneration and NMJ disruption observed in ALS. We show that miR126-5p is altered in ALS models and that it can modulate Sema3 and NRP protein expression. Furthermore, NRP1 elevations in motor neurons and muscle secretion of Sema3A contribute to axon degeneration and NMJ disruption in ALS.

It is characterized by neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disruption, MN axon degeneration, and neuronal death (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Frey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moloney et al., 2014</xref>). Despite some progress, currently no effective treatment is available for ALS. The diversity of ALS-related mutations has given rise to the use of numerous animal models with diverse phenotypes, ranging from no effect on MN function to severe progressive paralysis (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Philips and Rothstein, 2015</xref>). Approximately 20% of familial ALS is accounted for by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (<italic>SOD1</italic>) gene (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Scrutton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Rosen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gurney et al., 1994</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>SOD1</italic> gene (mSOD1) have also been described in sporadic cases (sALS) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rakhit et al., 2004</xref>). Other mutations found in ALS patients include hexanucleotide expansion repeats in the <italic>C9orf72</italic> locus, which lead to various dipeptide repeats (e.g., proline-arginine or glycine-arginine repeats: PR<sub>50</sub> and GR<sub>50</sub>, respectively), and in the gene encoding the TDP43 RNA binding protein (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Buratti, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2017</xref>). An efficient method for studying NMJ stability and health <italic>in vitro</italic> is by using the microfluidic chamber (MFC) system, which allows the culture of primary myocytes in one compartment, and MNs in the other, thus setting up conditions conducive to generating active NMJs (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zahavi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The neurodegeneration that occurs in ALS is considered to be a non&#x02013;cell-autonomous process involving interactions between the neuron and its diverse extracellular microenvironments via an unknown mechanism (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ilieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tsitkanou et al., 2016</xref>). Although the molecular basis for neuronal dysfunction and death in ALS is still poorly understood, it may be due to alterations in the nature of the extracellular signaling pathways that switch from prosurvival to toxic (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ilieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Perlson et al., 2009</xref>). Numerous studies support the notion that multiple tissues outside the CNS, including skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dupuis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tsitkanou et al., 2016</xref>), astrocytes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Nagai et al., 2007</xref>), and microglia (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), contribute to ALS pathologies. Alterations in RNA metabolism and microRNAs (miRs) can contribute to, and also be part of, mechanisms that initiate the disease (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lemmens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Emde and Hornstein, 2014</xref>). miRs are post-transcriptional regulators that play an important role in many cellular processes, such as axon growth and retraction, and were demonstrated to be involved in many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hawley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Molasy et al., 2017</xref>). Alterations in miR expression profile were identified specifically in axons of ALS models (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Rotem et al., 2017</xref>), as well in muscles leading to increasing attempts to either use or target miRs as therapeutic strategies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Di Pietro et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that alterations in RNA and miRNA metabolism, of both MNs and neighboring cells, can regulate a secreted destabilizing signal, which in turn, facilitates axon degeneration and NMJ disruption.</p><p>Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) was initially identified as a repellent guidance molecule (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Worzfeld and Offermanns, 2014</xref>). However, later works showed that it can also induce neuronal cell death of sympathetic, sensory, retinal, and cortical neurons (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Shirvan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). Neuropilin1 (NRP1) has been shown to be the receptor binding component for Sema3A as well as some other Type 3 Semaphorins (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kolodkin et al., 1997</xref>). Sema3A was found to be upregulated following CNS injury as well as in several neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Van Battum et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, Sema3A was found to be upregulated in terminal Schwann cells of the <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> transgenic mouse model for ALS and in the motor cortex of ALS patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;rner et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that it plays a toxic role in disease pathology and progression.</p><p>Here we demonstrated that alterations in miR126-5p result in upregulation of Type 3 Semaphorins and its cobinding receptor NRP1 in muscles and MN axons of ALS models, respectively. We further demonstrate <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> the contribution of this pathway to axon degeneration and NMJ disruption in ALS models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Animals and vector injections.</title><p>HB9::GFP (stock #005029) mice were originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.

After the wells were punched, a small &#x0201c;cave&#x0201d; was created in the explant well near the grooves using a 25G needle, keeping the explant in place. Microfluidic devices were cleaned of surface particles using adhesive tape and were sterilized in 70% ethanol for 15 min. Devices were completely dried under sterile conditions using UV radiation and then attached to a sterile 60 mm plastic dish (Nunc) with gentle pressure, and the margins were sealed with polydimethylsilxane before incubation at 70&#x000b0;C for 30 min to prevent the detachment of the chamber. Muscle channels were coated with Matrigel diluted 1:10 with DMEM containing 2.5% penicillin-streptomycin-nystatin (PSN) for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C, before filling the muscle wells with 150 &#x003bc;l of Bioamf-2 medium.

Imaging was performed under bright-field conditions at a rate of &#x0223c;33 fps while using a 20&#x000d7; objective. A myocyte contraction plot was then profiled using an image-based method previously described (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zahavi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ionescu et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, only myocytes that came in contact with axons were plotted. Time-lapse images were taken for analysis using ImageJ. To create a time trace of contractions, high contrast (bright or dark) ROIs were selected on each myotube. Movement of the selected spot due to myotube contraction was assessed by the change in the ROI intensity over time. The number of strong contractions, as measured from the time trace, was manually validated by reexamining the time-lapse image series. The number of strong and weak contractions in innervated myotubes was compared before and after 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> TTX was added to the neuronal compartment. A myotube with a post- to pre-TTX difference of &#x0003e;50% was measured as an increase or decrease in contraction, and the fraction of increased, decreased, and unchanged myotubes was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunostaining of cell cultures.</title><p>Cultures were fixed in 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% DS (Donkey Serum), 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS.

We therefore hypothesized that destabilizing factors secreted from adult presymptomatic ALS mutant muscles might be involved in triggering axon degeneration of MNs. Because Sema3A is known to act in such a manner, at least in development, and it was already reported to be elevated in ALS, we decided to focus on this factor (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;rner et al., 2016</xref>). Following this hypothesis, we first examined the expression of Sema3A in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> GC muscles in comparison with that of their LMs; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1-1">Fig. 1-1</xref>). Western blot analysis of muscle protein extracts revealed significant elevations in Sema3A protein levels in muscles of presymptomatic <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice as early as P30 and P60, whereas testing Sema3A levels in younger animals (P7) showed no apparent differences compared with their LM controls (mean fold change over LM: P30 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 3.08 &#x000b1; 0.86; P30 LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.36; P60 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.45; P60 LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.32; P7 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.7; P7 LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.42). To validate this difference, we also tested the transcript levels of Sema3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). qPCR analysis of total RNA extracts from muscles at presymptomatic <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> stage and LM mice identified an &#x0223c;1.7-fold increase in Sema3A mRNA of <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> muscles (mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 1.72 &#x000b1; 0.32; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.06). Because GC muscle tissues contain heterogeneous cell types and to verify that the levels of Sema3A are indeed higher specifically in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> muscles fibers, we immunostained primary myocyte cultures from P60 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> and LM mice for Sema3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>,<italic>E</italic>). Quantifying the mean intensity values showed a significant 50% increase in the <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> myocytes (a mean fold change in intensity over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.06; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.04). We also collected CM from myocyte cultures to determine whether the increase in Sema3A protein also results in an increase in its secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>F</italic>). Western blot analysis indicated that Sema3A levels were also elevated in P60 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> myocyte-CM (a mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.55; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.08). Because NMJ disruption is a primary event in ALS, we sought to examine the levels of Sema3A in NMJ <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic>). Immunostaining for Sema3A in GC muscles showed a sixfold increase in the number of muscle fibers expressing Sema3A in their NMJs. Whereas only &#x0223c;5% of NMJs stained positively for Sema3A in LM muscles, we identified its expression in &#x0223c;30% of NMJs in P60 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice (the mean percentage of NMJs expressing Sema3A: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 30.83 &#x000b1; 4.73%; LM, 4.56 &#x000b1; 2.4%). Interestingly, a previous study described Sema3A elevation in SOD<sup>G93A</sup> mice specifically in fast fatigue NMJs expressing myosin-IIb marker (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>). Because fast fatigue NMJs are the first to become disrupted and be eliminated in ALS pathology, we examined Sema3A levels both at P90 and P120 and hypothesized that Sema3A levels will eventually drop in later stages of the disease. We found that whereas the percentage of NMJs expressing Sema3A in SOD<sup>G93A</sup> in P90 animals is similar to P60, the end-stage animals (P120) were shown to display a reduction in Sema3A-positive NMJs, and no apparent difference existed between WT and <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1-2">Fig. 1-2</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>). Together, these results indicate that a significant part of the MN population is exposed to high levels of Sema3A in presymptomatic stages and that this specific population is disrupted and eliminated during disease progression. We then proceeded to investigate the expression of the Sema3A-receptor binding unit, NRP1, in ALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>I</italic>). Western blot analysis of GC muscle extracts revealed a significant &#x0223c;8-fold increase in NRP1 (the mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 8.6 &#x000b1; 2.2; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.3). Because MNs are a primary target in ALS, we wanted to determine whether NRP1 is also overexpressed in the MNs of <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice. First, we performed Western blot analysis of SNs and observed an &#x0223c;2-fold elevation in NRP1 levels of P60 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>J</italic>; the mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 1.96 &#x000b1; 1.22; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.21). Next, we obtained protein extracts of primary MN cultures for Western blot analysis and confirmed an &#x0223c;2.5-fold elevation in NRP1 levels in the MNs of <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>K</italic>; the mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.16; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.06). Immunostaining of primary MN cultures for NRP1 resulted in analogous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>L&#x02013;N</italic>). Intriguingly, the NRP1 signal in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> is generally higher than in LM and is increased even more in axons compared with cell bodies (the mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> soma, 1.86 &#x000b1; 0.13; LM soma, 1 &#x000b1; 0.05; <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> axon, 3.83 &#x000b1; 0.95; LM axon, 1 &#x000b1; 0.11). Finally, immunostaining for NRP1 in GC muscles confirmed a similar shift of &#x0223c;30% in the number of NMJs expressing NRP1, as we had observed for Sema3A in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice, both at P60 and P90. However, also this time, the differences were abolished in the end stages of the disease (P120) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>O</italic>,<italic>P</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1-2">Fig. 1-2</xref><italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic>; the mean percentage of NMJs expressing NRP1: P60: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 27.5 &#x000b1; 2.04%; LM, 21.27 &#x000b1; 1.22%). To determine whether the elevated NRP1 levels result from feedback due to an increase in its ligand, we treated primary MN cultures from LM embryos with soluble Sema3A for 3 d and performed Western blot analysis on cell culture lysates. Importantly, we did not observe any difference in NRP1 expression after applying Sema3A, suggesting that NRP1 levels are regulated by an intrinsic mechanism in MNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1-3">Fig. 1-3</xref>). Finally, to validate our finding with other ALS models and to emphasize the impact of Sema3A in ALS, we performed Western blot analysis for Sema3A and NRP1 expression in human mesenchymal stem cells from sporadic ALS patients and healthy controls, as well as in myocyte-expressing C9orf72-PR<sub>50</sub> and their CM for Sema3A. In addition, we compared the results with those of a mock control. Remarkably, in all of these ALS models, we identified high expression of Sema3A and NRP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1-4">Fig. 1-4</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Presymptomatic elevation in the levels of Sema3A and NRP1 in ALS models. <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>, <bold><italic>B</italic></bold>, Western blot analysis of P30 and P60 GC muscle extracts revealed that the levels of Sema3A are elevated in presymptomatic <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> muscles compared with their corresponding LM control wherein at earlier stages we found no significant difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1-1">Figure 1-1</xref>).

Briefly, ventral SC explants from healthy 12-day-old (E12) HB9::GFP embryos were cultured in the proximal compartment, in the presence or absence of primary myocytes extracted from adult mice in the distal compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2-1">Fig. 2-1</xref>).

However, because ALS-mutated muscles were found to have intrinsic abnormalities throughout disease progression (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Loeffler et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that the nature of these factors will be altered.

Transfected myocytes exhibit normal morphology and fusion in comparison with the WT muscle culture in our system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2-2">Fig. 2-2</xref>). Nevertheless, all ALS-causing mutations that we examined recapitulated the phenotypes we described previously in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>F</italic>; GFP, 40.65 &#x000b1; 16%; GR<sub>50</sub>, 5.2 &#x000b1; 3.49%; PR<sub>50</sub>, 0 &#x000b1; 0%; TDP43<sup>A315T</sup>, 8.75 &#x000b1; 6.39%). These results suggest that the dysregulated secretion of factors from ALS mutant muscles takes place, which in turn activates axon retraction and degeneration. Because muscles can either secrete positive or negative signaling molecules, we could not determine whether our observation within this assay originates from an increase in the release of destabilizing factors or the diminished release of positive factors. To this end, we collected muscle-CM from WT and <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> muscle cultures in complete medium containing positive factors, such as BDNF and GDNF, as was previously performed in mass culture (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Nagai et al., 2007</xref>), and ultimately applied it only to the distal axons of both WT and <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic>). Interestingly, we observed that axon degeneration occurs only when <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> myocyte-CM is applied to <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>H</italic>; LM, 3.72 &#x000b1; 1.15%; <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 34.7 &#x000b1; 4%), whereas in all other combinations the axons remained intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2-3">Fig. 2-3</xref>). To further determine whether Type 3 Semaphorins, such as Sema3A, contribute to MN axon degeneration in this assay, we investigated whether NRP1-blocking antibody application can block this phenotype. Here again, we observed a rescue effect by this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>H</italic>; <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> + NRP1-antibody 18.6 &#x000b1; 7%), although the protection was incomplete. These results reinforce our hypothesis, suggesting that ALS-mutated muscles secrete destabilizing factors, such as Sema3A. Importantly, these results emphasize that <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> MNs exhibit a higher sensitivity to degeneration, and support the MN unique vulnerability as well as the non&#x02013;cell-autonomous mechanism of ALS. Interestingly, previous attempts to block Sema3A signaling in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice using either a similar antibody approach or by crossing transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of Sema3A with <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice also resulted in only a mild improvement or none at all of motor functions (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Venkova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Moloney et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that Sema3A plays a complex role in MNs and that perhaps other related proteins are involved. This also led us to investigate whether a wider deregulation of secreted factors released by the diseased muscles exists. Indeed, examining other members of the Semaphorin family, we found that the percentage of NMJs expressing Sema3B, as well as NRP2 is elevated in the <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> ALS model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2-4">Fig. 2-4</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the destabilizing effect of ALS muscles over MN axons involves more than a single factor; thus, it cannot be blocked or rescued by targeting one factor at a time. Moreover, the multiplicity of effectors suggests that a higher-order regulator, such as miRNA, might be involved in this process.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="vid3"><label>Movie 3.</label><caption><p>HB9::GFP axonal growth toward <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> myocytes.

We used Nanostring miRNA-chip technology to screen for alterations in &#x0223c;800 miRs of presymptomatic P60 <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice and their LM controls. The screen yielded 8 significantly altered miRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3-1">Fig. 3-1</xref>). Because we found that Sema3A levels were elevated in muscles, we narrowed our focus to those miRs that were reduced and that could regulate its expression, specifically miR126-5p and miR133a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>; the mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 0.74 &#x000b1; 0.03; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.03; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3-1">Fig. 3-1</xref>). A targeted search for these miRs in databases (miRDB, Pictar, miRbase, and miRTarBase) revealed that both miRs are predicted to regulate Semaphorin signaling genes as well as other relevant transcripts of ALS-related genes. Interestingly, we previously described deep-sequencing analyses of primary MN cultures expressing <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> or TDP43<sup>A315T</sup> and demonstrated that miR126-5p is also correspondingly decreased in diseased MN axons, but not in their soma (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Rotem et al., 2017</xref>). This information led us to further focus our investigation on miR126-5p. We used qPCR to validate that miR-126&#x02013;5p levels in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> GC muscles point to a similar trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>; the mean fold change over LM: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 0.47 &#x000b1; 0.2; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.45). To verify that miR126-5p can regulate the expression of Semaphorin3 and Neuropilin signaling members, we transfected HeLa cells, which are known to endogenously express Sema3A, Sema3B, NRP1, and NRP2 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2001</xref>), with miR126-5p or with the irrelevant miR142, which is not predicted to target any of these genes, as a negative control. To this end, we isolated RNA from these cultures and performed qPCR analysis to determine the mRNA levels of Sema3A, Sema3B, NRP1, and NRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D&#x02013;G</italic>). Our results indicate that miR126-5p specifically targets Sema3A, NRP1, Sema3B, and NRP2 (RT-PCR: mean &#x00394;Ct-NRP1: miR126, 3.79 &#x000b1; 0.71; miR142, 2.83 &#x000b1; 0.57; &#x00394;Ct-Sema3A: miR126, 4.84 &#x000b1; 0.22; miR142, 3.84 &#x000b1; 0.34; &#x00394;Ct-NRP2: miR126, 7.6 &#x000b1; 0.30; miR142, 6.2 &#x000b1; 0.37; &#x00394;Ct-Sema3B: miR126, 8.1 &#x000b1; 0.10; miR142, 7.05 &#x000b1; 0.14). To investigate whether miR126-5p overexpression can also inhibit Sema3A function, we used a recently described impedance-based approach. U87MG human glioblastoma cells, which express NRP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3-2">Fig. 3-2</xref><italic>A</italic>) and were used previously specifically in this assay (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Birger et al., 2015</xref>), were transfected to overexpress miR126-5p or miR142 as a control. One day after transfection, cells were resuspended and plated in xCELLigence multiwell electric plates. The next day, Sema3A was added to the cultures, and any morphological or adhesive changes were monitored by the impedance readout. As demonstrated by TIRF imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>H</italic>), adding Sema3A to responsive cells, such as U87MG cells, induces their detachment from the culture dish. This detachment can be measured as a decrease in impedance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3-2">Fig. 3-2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Shortly after Sema3A was added to the cultures, cells expressing miR142 exhibited decreased impedance, whereas cells expressing miR126-5p did not respond to Sema3A in the medium and kept growing with a corresponding increase in impedance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>I</italic>). Hence, we showed that the excess production of destabilizing factors in ALS is likely to be mediated downstream of a deregulation in miR126-5p.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>miR126-5p is depleted in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> muscles and regulates Sema3 and NRP expression. <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>, NanoString chip screen heat map of significantly altered miRs in P60 muscles of <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> compared with LM mice (extended table under <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3-1">Figure 3-1</xref>).

Next, we investigated whether overexpressing miR126-5p in both <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> and PR<sub>50</sub> myocytes can rescue the negative effect on MN growth that we observed before. To this end, primary myoblasts were transfected to overexpress either miR126-5p (SOD1<sup>miR126</sup>; PR<sub>50</sub><sup>miR126</sup>) or miR142 (SOD1<sup>miR142</sup>; PR<sub>50</sub><sup>miR142</sup>) and were then plated in the distal compartment of the MFC. Myoblasts were differentiated into mature myocytes while expressing the miRs for 7 d, after which HB9::GFP explants were cultured in the proximal compartment. Once axons reached the microgrooves, their extension toward the muscle compartment was monitored for 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). Evidently, cocultures with SOD1<sup>miR126</sup> and PR<sub>50</sub><sup>miR126</sup> myocytes retained wild-type behavior and manifested a clear rescue effect on the rate of axon traversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic>,<italic>E</italic>; the mean traversal rate of axons: SOD1<sup>miR126</sup>, 40.77 &#x000b1; 6.68%; SOD1<sup>miR142</sup>, 12 &#x000b1; 7.6%; PR<sub>50</sub><sup>miR126</sup>, 45.6 &#x000b1; 9.4%; PR50<sup>miR142</sup>, 16 &#x000b1; 3.6%). Thus far, we have shown that myocytes expressing various ALS-linked mutations facilitate MN axon degeneration and delay their growth in a simplified compartmental coculture assay. However, while observing the cocultures for longer periods, we found that axons eventually do traverse the muscle compartment and form functional synapses with the myocytes. Using an image-based method that we recently developed to quantify contraction and assess the innervation in <italic>in vitro</italic> cocultures (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ionescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Zahavi et al., 2017</xref>), we observed that the contractile behavior of innervated <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> myocytes is significantly different from that of innervated LM myocytes, which tend to contract in a bursting pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>F</italic>,<italic>G</italic>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="vid5">Movies 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="vid6">6</xref>).

Furthermore, careful analysis at P120 also identified a mild rescue by miR-126&#x02013;5p overexpression. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>; P120: WT, 74.35 &#x000b1; 4.74%; SOD<sup>G93A</sup>, 20.12 &#x000b1; 5.01%; SOD1<sup>miR126</sup>, 30.82 &#x000b1; 3.97%; SOD1<sup>miR142</sup>, 18.18 &#x000b1; 3.12%). Next, we performed histological analyses to determine muscle fiber wasting and tissue abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic>,<italic>E</italic>). P120 GC muscles of WT, <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, and both SOD1<sup>miR126</sup> and SOD1<sup>miR142</sup> were stained with H&#x00026;E for histological examination, and the minimal diameter of myofibers was analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. We observed a mild, but significant, increase in the minimal fiber size of the SOD1<sup>miR126</sup>-injected muscle compared with the SOD1<sup>miR142</sup> mock control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>; P120: WT, 40.25 &#x000b1; 2.28%; SOD<sup>G93A</sup>, 18.5 &#x000b1; 0.64%; SOD1<sup>miR126</sup>, 23 &#x000b1; 1.87; SOD1<sup>miR142</sup>, 19 &#x000b1; 1.47). Last, we performed a behavioral test using the CatWalk gait analysis technique. This video-based method is a computerized version of the ink bath assay and provides an objective and dynamic wide range of gait analyses (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Deumens et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, it has been used before specifically with the <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mouse model and displayed significant differences in several parameters (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mead et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gerber et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>F</italic>). One output is the Mean Stand Index (MSI), which measures the speed at which the paws detach from the walking surface. Because aged <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice suffer motor defects, their MSI values for both hindlimbs are dramatically lower than their LM values. Remarkably, the MSI values of the SOD1<sup>miR126</sup>-injected limbs were significantly higher at P90 and similar to the LM control values, whereas the SOD1<sup>miR142</sup>-injected limb was reminiscent of typical <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>G</italic>; mean fold change over WT: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 0.68 &#x000b1; 0.02; SOD1<sup>miR126</sup>, 0.74 &#x000b1; 0.06; SOD1<sup>miR142</sup>, 0.65 &#x000b1; 0.04; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.04). We also examined other established parameters that have been shown to be altered in the SOD<sup>G93A</sup> model (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mead et al., 2011</xref>). We specifically focused on the percentage of single-support parameter, which indicates the relative duration of contact of all combined paws with the glass floor, and on the base of support parameter, which indicates the average width of limb spreading between both front, or both hindpaws. Remarkably, we observed a significant rescue phenotype for both parameters in the injected mice at age of P90. Furthermore, the improvement in base of support parameter persisted also in P120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>H</italic>,<italic>I</italic>; Percentage of Support Single: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 0.43 &#x000b1; 0.05; injected, 1.06 &#x000b1; 0.24; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.1; Base of Support, P90: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 0.87 &#x000b1; 0.01; injected, 1.02 &#x000b1; 0.02; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.02; P120: <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>, 0.858 &#x000b1; 0.02; injected, 0.95 &#x000b1; 0.02; LM, 1 &#x000b1; 0.02).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>pLL-eGFP-miR126-5p injected into GC muscles of presymptomatic <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice transiently rescues the early phenotype appearance <italic>in vivo</italic>. <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>, Schematic view of the <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental procedure. <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice were injected with either pLL-eGFP-miR126-5p or pLL-eGFP-miR142 in their right or left GC muscles, respectively.

We provided one specific mechanism for a well-described molecule (Sema3A), by which miR126-5p contributes to ALS pathology. We have also demonstrated that miR126-5p alterations facilitate axon degeneration and NMJ disruption in an ALS model as an outcome of presymptomatic elevations in the production and secretion of their target genes, which encode for destabilizing factors, such as Sema3 family members. Overexpressing miR126-5p in <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> muscles inhibits the neurodegenerative process. These findings reveal how alterations in miR126-5p can be toxic to MNs, and identify a non&#x02013;cell-autonomous neurodegeneration process in ALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Alterations in Semaphorin3A regulation by miR126-5p trigger MN degeneration in ALS. miR126-5p is a negative regulator of Sema3 signaling in skeletal muscles. Downregulation of miR126-5p in ALS disease drives the overexpression and secretion of Sema3A and potentially other NMJ-destabilizing factors in skeletal muscles. The downregulation in miR126-5p in diseased MNs drives the overexpression of NRP1 specifically in axons. The excess binding and activation of the NRP1 receptor by its overexpressed ligand Sema3A as a result of miR126-5p alteration promote NMJ disruption and axon degeneration in a spatially confined process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zns9991808380006"/></fig><sec><title>miR126-5p as a master regulator of proper NMJ function</title><p>Our results indicate that the expression of ALS-causative mutations results in the secretion of repellent factors, including a number of Type 3 Semaphorins and potentially other factors. It is thus likely that a general gene repression mechanism, specifically miR system, is altered under such conditions. This assumption is also consistent with the fact that miR alterations are apparent in various neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Haramati et al., 2010</xref>). Here we identified such an miR and showed how alterations in this specific miR can regulate the essential signaling pathways in MNs and can trigger neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, and in line with our findings, a very recent paper demonstrated a mechanism by which miR126-5p modulates Sema3A expression through SetD5 expression, and it emphasizes its positive effect on retinal endothelial cells' survival (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Villain et al., 2018</xref>). However, aside from targeting Sema3A and Sema3B, as well as NRP1 and NRP2, miR126-5p is predicted to regulate other Semaphorin signaling factors, such as Sema6D, PLXNA2, JNK2, JNK3, and PTEN. In addition, miR126-5p can regulate the ALS and motor-unit-related genes VEGF-A, SPAST, MMPs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2014</xref>), AGRIN (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Vilmont et al., 2016</xref>), and C9orf72, which are directly involved in ALS. Therefore, miR126-5p can serve as a master regulator of NMJ health by controlling multiple signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Sema3 alterations in ALS: settling the contradictory reports</title><p>A critical initiating event for the mechanism outlined above is the alterations in Sema3 signaling in ALS models and patients. Sema3 family members were previously found to be upregulated in terminal Schwann cells in the NMJs of <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, Sema3A was also shown to be elevated in the motor cortex of postmortem ALS patients but not in their SC (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;rner et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this, NRP1 antibodies, blocking the obligatory binding receptor for Sema3A, were injected into <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice as a potential treatment (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Venkova et al., 2014</xref>). However, anti-NRP1 blocking antibody had only a modest effect. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that crossing mice expressing a truncated form of Sema3A with <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> mice did not result in any rescue effect (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Moloney et al., 2017</xref>). An explanation for a minor effect or not at all, as a result of blocking Sema3A activity, could be based on the idea of multiple toxic factors that play a role in ALS pathology. Another explanation for this contradiction could be the fact that Sema3A plays a more complex role in the biology of MNs. Indeed, Sema3A was shown to increase survival when added to mass cultures of mouse MNs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Molofsky et al., 2014</xref>) and human MNs (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Birger et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, deletion of the Sema3A gene specifically in spinal astrocytes resulted in a gradual loss of spinal MNs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Molofsky et al., 2014</xref>), thus suggesting that Sema3A has a positive effect when introduced near the cell body. When these findings are together with our results, apparently Sema3A has both positive and negative effects on MNs, perhaps depending on its specific subcellular localization. When Sema3A is secreted from muscles and targets distal axons at NMJs, it mediates their destabilization; however, when it is secreted by spinal astrocytes and targets MN soma, it acts as a survival factor. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that a genetic approach to inhibit Sema3A in all cells in a mouse model of ALS had no effect in inhibiting the symptoms. The injection of anti-NRP1 may have been a bit more beneficial possibly either because it was able to inhibit Sema3A outside the CNS more effectively, or alternatively, because NRP1 blocks other Type 3 Semaphorins as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Autonomous versus non&#x02013;cell-autonomous contributions to ALS progression</title><p>ALS is considered a complex disease, with unique MN features as well as non&#x02013;cell-autonomous contributions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ilieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Musar&#x000f2;, 2013</xref>). Some evidence suggests that the NMJ is the first compartment to be disrupted in ALS rather than the MN soma; the disease is recognized as distal axonopathy in a non&#x02013;cell-autonomous process (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moloney et al., 2014</xref>). Two main cell populations that have been shown to play a role in distal axonopathy are glia and muscle cells, which secrete factors that influence MN survival and health (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moloney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tsitkanou et al., 2016</xref>). However, the complexity of the disease and the involvement of several tissues raise controversies regarding the contribution of each tissue to the disease pathology. With skeletal muscle, few works have concluded that muscles do not play a role in ALS pathology. Reducing hSOD<sup>G93A</sup> levels by injecting siRNA against its transcript directly into muscles of the SOD<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model, as well as crossing Lox SOD<sup>G37R</sup> with the Cre coding sequence under the control of the muscle creatine kinase promoter, or performing manipulations using Follistatin did not affect the disease onset and survival (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> application of muscle-CM from SOD<sup>G93A</sup>-expressing muscle on healthy mass culture and ES cell-derived MNs resulted in no effect (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Nagai et al., 2007</xref>). However, in contrast with these findings, evidence indicates that overexpressing mutant SOD1 protein specifically in healthy skeletal muscle induces an ALS phenotype and the degeneration of MNs, supporting a direct role for muscle in ALS physiology (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dobrowolny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Martin, 2010</xref>). Moreover, muscle from ALS patients and models has been shown to exhibit impaired mitochondrial function (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2010</xref>) and abnormalities in muscle biology (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Manzano et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that applying presymptomatic <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> muscle-CM directly, and only on <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic>-expressing MN axon tips, results in their degeneration, suggesting that both tissue types are necessary for exhibiting the disease phenotype. Furthermore, contradictory reports were published on transgenic mice expressing <italic>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></italic> only in the MNs. For example, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lino et al. (2002</xref>) showed a very mild phenotype, whereas <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jaarsma et al. (2008</xref>) demonstrated a significant toxic effect. In this study, we showed that muscle-secreted factors are capable of modulating MN axons. Whereas wild-type muscle-secreted factors facilitate axon growth, several ALS-related mutations, expressed in muscles, result in the secretion of factors that cause retraction and degeneration when exclusively introduced to axons. At least one of these factors is Sema3A. The secretion of Sema3A by the muscle itself is likely to contribute to the instability of the MN axons. However, our results also show that ALS mutant muscles themselves cause axon degeneration and a delay in axon growth toward the muscles, but eventually the connections between axons and muscles are established. Thus, at least in our system, apparently the non&#x02013;cell-autonomous contributions of the muscle are insufficient to recapitulate all the toxic effects on MNs. However, once the MNs also carry an ALS mutation, axons are more susceptible to degeneration by mutated muscle-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic>), thus demonstrating the critical contribution of the MNs to ALS progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Do diseased muscles initiate axon degeneration or inhibit regeneration?</title><p>Our data suggest that muscles are involved in modulating MN health in ALS disease. We showed, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, that muscles secrete destabilizing factors, such as Sema3A, as well as facilitate axon degeneration and NMJ disruption. Intriguingly, a previous study demonstrated that Sema3A expression is limited only to myosin IIb positive fibers, which are prone to be disrupted first in ALS (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>). These data support our findings in which the percentage of NMJs that express Sema3A and NRP1 is reduced at the end stage of the disease, most likely along with the fast fatigue NMJs. However, although the suggested mechanism involves muscle-MN interaction, because of the nature of our experimental model, we cannot fully determine whether the mutated muscles act by initiating the degeneration of MN axons or by inhibiting their regrowth and NMJ repair, which was also suggested previously (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Arbour et al., 2015</xref>). Perhaps muscle toxicity plays an active role in both pathways. However, future efforts should be made to resolve this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>miRs as a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS disease</title><p>In this paper, we demonstrated a positive effect of miR126-5p on ALS disease progression and suggested a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS disease. Nevertheless, our <italic>in vivo</italic> data show that the most significant positive effect of miR126-5p on ALS pathology was achieved at P90, whereas at later stages only modest effects were achieved. These results point to miR126-5p as a targeted treatment for an early phenotype but without a sustained beneficial contribution at later stages of ALS disease. However, keeping in mind that we injected miR126-5p into small parts of the whole GC muscle and only once at P60, as well as the fact that the efficiency of the procedure of the injection can also affect the efficacy of this treatment, we cannot rule out the possibility that a broader test of long-term efficacy will result in a stronger and more positive outcome.
