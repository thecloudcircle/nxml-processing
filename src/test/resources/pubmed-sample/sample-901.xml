In the present study, the IL-10 gene of African clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>) was first cloned, and its expression pattern and 3D structure were also analyzed. The frog IL-10 mRNA encoded 172 amino acids which possessed several conserved features found in IL-10s from other species, including five-exon/four-intron genomic structure, conserved four cysteine residues, IL-10 family motif, and six <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-helices. Real-time PCR showed that frog IL-10 mRNA was ubiquitous expressed in all examined tissues, highly in some immune related tissues including kidney, spleen, and intestine and lowly in heart, stomach, and liver. The frog IL-10 mRNA was upregulated at 24&#x02009;h after LPS stimulation, indicating that it plays a part in the host immune response to bacterial infection. Another IL, termed as IL-20, was identified from the frog IL-10 locus, which might be the homologue of mammalian IL-19/20 according to the analysis results of the phylogenetic tree and the sequence identities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Based on structural features, the cytokines have been grouped into several families such as interleukin (IL), interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and transforming growth factor (TGF) family [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The homologies among genes from different families are quite limited [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to sequence homologies, similarities of receptor chain, and functional properties, ILs are further divided into IL-1, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-17 families [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. IL-10 family consists of nine members: IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, IL28A, IL-28B, and IL-29. In mammals these members clustered, respectively, in three genomic loci: IL-10 locus in which IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 are included; IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> locus in which IL-22 and IL-26 are included; IFN-<italic>&#x003bb;</italic> locus in which IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29 (also called IFN-<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>2, IFN-<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>3, and IFN-<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>1, resp.) are included [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These IL-10 family members in mammals are involved in diverse immune regulation and host defense during bacterial and viral infection and also were important for the differentiation and proliferation of immune cells, such as T cell, B cell, and natural killer (NK) cell [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Among these IL-10 family members, IL-10 was originally called cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF), which was firstly cloned from Th2 clones, because of its inhibition on the production of several cytokines, such as IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Subsequently, it was renamed as IL-10 and found to be expressed by the cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity, including NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and B cells [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several immunostimulants, such as LPS, polyI:C [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], could enhance the expression of IL-10 in the above-mentioned cells.</p><p>To data, several IL-10 family members have been identified from lower vertebrates. In fish IL-10 and IL-20L clustered in the IL-10 locus. The latter might be the ancestral that gave rise to IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 genes [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fish IL-22 and IL-26 genes were in IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> locus, being similar to those in mammalian [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In amphibian, two IL-10 loci, that is, IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> locus and IFN-<italic>&#x003bb;</italic> locus, have been well characterized, with IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> locus containing IL-22 and IL-26 genes [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and IFN-<italic>&#x003bb;</italic> locus IFN<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>1-5 genes [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, information about the IL-10 locus in amphibian was still blank.</p><p>Functional study in fish revealed that the IL-10 network in lower vertebrates was quite complex. For example, two trout IL-10s (IL-10a and IL-10b) possessed different expression pattern after stimuli stimulation and bacterial infection [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Goldfish IL-10 could downregulate the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-8, and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and also IL-10 itself, indicating fish IL-10 might be an anti-inflammatory cytokine [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>African clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>) is the model animal of amphibian. Due to its special evolutionary position, it has long been used to gain better appreciation of the evolution of the complex immune system [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To provide more information on the evolution of IL-10 family, the frog IL-10 gene was cloned and structurally analyzed. Also, the interleukins in frog IL-10 locus were identified. And on this basis a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was implemented in order to deepen the understanding of the evolution relationships among the various IL-10 family members in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Cloning of Frog IL-10 cDNA</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from frogspleen using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and transcripted into cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcription system (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full cDNA sequence of frog IL-10 was obtained by using 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-RACE PCR method with the synthesized cDNA as template. The primers used for 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-RACE were designed based on the predicted results from GenScan and FGENESH+ analysis.

Briefly, the frog IL-10 protein was solvated by 17,297 water molecules in an octahedral box with 1.0&#x02009;nm edges from the molecular boundary. Nine Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions were added to the frog IL-10 model with a net positive charge of +9 to obtain a neutral system. The configuration was energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm (maximum number of steps: 4,000) to remove steric conflicts between the protein and water molecules. The energy-minimized models were stimulated for 100,000 steps for a total of 200 ps under 300&#x02009;K using position-restrained MD in NPT conditions. Snapshots of the trajectory were taken every 1 ps. The final MD of 5,000,000 steps was carried out for 10,000 ps (10&#x02009;ns) using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) electrostatics method under NPT conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5.

Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Sequence Analysis of Frog IL-10</title><p>The full-length sequence of the frog IL-10 cDNA (Genbank accession number EF104912) comprised a 5&#x02032; terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 159&#x02009;bp, an open reading frame (ORF) of 519&#x02009;bp, and a 3&#x02032;-UTR of 567&#x02009;bp. No ATTTA sequence was observed in the 3&#x02032;-UTR, which might involve in the shortening of the half-life of several cytokines and growth factors [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The genomic structure of frog IL-10 was composed of five exons and four introns. The size of the four introns was 1836&#x02009;bp, 1021&#x02009;bp, 609&#x02009;bp, and 2183&#x02009;bp, respectively, which was a little larger than the counterpart in human IL-10 or zebrafish IL-10. The exons of IL-10 genes were relatively conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The typical intron splice motifs, that is, GT and AG, were observed, respectively, at the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-end of each intron.</p><p>The putative protein of frog IL-10 was 172 amino acids in length, containing a 19 a.a. signal peptide at its N-terminus. The theoretical molecular weight and the isoelectric point (pI) of the mature peptide of frog IL-10 were 15.08&#x02009;kDa and 7.92, respectively. Two conserved IL-10 family signature motifs, L-[FILMV]-X(3)-[ILV]-X(3)-[FILMV]-X(5)-C-X(5)-[ILMV]-[ILMV]-X(3)-L-X(2)-[IV]-[FILMV] and KA-X(2)-E-X-D-[ILV]-[FLY]-[FILMV]-X(2)-[ILMV]-[EKQZ], were found to manifest as LLQDDLLQEFKGNLGCQSVSETIRFYLEEVL and KAMGEFDILIDYIE in frog IL-10. In addition, four conserved cysteine residues were observed in frog IL-10. Two extra cysteine residues at the N-terminals of fish IL-10 [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] were not found in frog, bird, and mammalian IL-10s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The frog IL-10 shared the highest identity with chicken IL-10 (58.3%), followed by 56.5% with human IL-10 and 41.7% with zebrafish IL-10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2.

This was also confirmed by a higher Z-score of 25.38 derived from the sequence-structure alignment between frogIL-10 and template using the FUGUE software. The high identity between a.a. sequences of frog IL-10 and template also confirmed that it was reasonable to do modeling using comparative modeling method.</p><p>The model of frog IL-10 was generated with Swill-PDB server and the quality of the resultant model was evaluated with PROCHECK and ERRAT software. The PROCHECK analysis showed that the phi-psi angles of 89.9% of the residues were in most favored regions, 7.1% in the additional allowed regions, 1.9% in generously allowed regions, and only 1.0% in disallowed regions. ERRAT program showed the overall quality factor of the frog IL-10 model was 96.31, which was more than 95%, indicating high resolution of structure. All these analyses suggested that this model could be used for further MD simulation.</p><p>The predicted spatial structure of frog IL-10 possessed six <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-helices, similar to that of human IL-10 monomer. However, there were some slight differences between the two proteins; for example, helix A and helix C of frog IL-10 were a little shorter which results in a longer AB loop and CD loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). MD analysis showed that the RMSD of frog IL-10 model became stable at 5&#x02009;ns after simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>).

Gene synteny analysis showed that the IL-10 locus was well conserved during evolution. Many conserved genes, for example, MAPKAPK2, DYRK3, and EIF2D, highly linked with IL-10 locus were found in all analyzed species. There were four ILs (IL-10, -19, -20, and -24) in the human IL-10 locus and also IL-10 and -19 in chicken IL-10 locus, but without IL-20 and -24.

It was clear that the IL-10 family members were mainly separated into four clusters with high bootstrap values, that is, IL-22, IL-26, IL-10, and IL19/20/24 clusters. Each of IL-22, IL-26, and IL-10 clusters contained all counterparts from fish, frog, and mammals. The IL19/20/24 cluster was further divided into three main clades: fish IL-20L clade, IL-19/20 clade, and mammal IL-24 clade. The IL-19/20 homologue newly identified from frog was grouped into the IL19/20/24 cluster and formed a sister group with all other cluster members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In the present study, the frog IL-10 gene was cloned, and its expression and 3D structure were also analyzed. The frog IL-10 has been found to share several conserved features with known IL-10s. First, frog IL-10 contained conserved amino acid residues and motifs that are essential for the bioactivity of IL-10, for example, the isoleucine residues at positon 87 (I<sup>87</sup>), which has been proved to be necessary for immunostimulatory function of human IL-10. Substitution of isoleucine with alanine can abrogate the immunostimulatory activity of IL-10 on thymocytes, mast cells, and alloantigenic responses while preserving immunosuppressive activity is concerned with the inhibition of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> production and the prolongation of cardiac allograft survival [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This residue was also found in frog IL-10, suggesting that frog IL-10 might possess similar immunostimulatory functions. Also, the four conserved cysteine residues, known to form two disulphide bonds and to be essential for maintaining the structure and bioactivity of human IL-10 [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], were found in frog IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Two extra cysteine residues existing in fish IL-10, for example, cys27 and cys32 in zebrafish IL-10, but being nonexistent in IL-10s from higher vertebrates, were absent in frog IL-10, suggesting that these two cysteine residues should be fish specific. An alternative scheme of disulphide bonds was predicted in fish IL-10 by disulphide prediction software, DISULFIND [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but the comparative modeling analysis of carp IL-10 suggested that the two cysteine residues could not form any significant bonds [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, further study is needed to reveal their exact function in fish IL-10.</p><p>Secondly, frog IL-10 possessed the conserved 3D structure, similar to that of human IL-10, consisting of six <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-helices termed A, B, C, D, E, and F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). The structural model of frog IL-10 in our study was confirmed to be acceptable based on the results of molecular dynamics analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>). It had been proved that these six <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-helices in human IL-10 are involved in associating with the other monomer to form two interpenetrating domains and that N-terminus, helix A, AB loop, DE loop, and helix F of human IL-10 were active sites for interacting with its receptors [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. That the conserved six <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-helices also existed in frog IL-10 suggested that the monomer of frog IL-10 might be firstly activated to form homodimer so as to bind to its receptors. However, shorter helix A and helix C and longer AB loop and CD loop were observed in frog IL-10. In addition, frog IL-10 possessed the same genomic organization as all reported IL-10s, containing five exons and four introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Lowly expression of frog IL-10 gene in liver, heart, and stomach tissues was in agreement with the results of the study on trout IL-10 [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The relatively high level of frog IL-10 expression occurred in immune related tissues, for example, intestine and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>), suggesting that the frog IL-10 plays some roles under basal conditions. After LPS stimulation, the expression of frog IL-10 was upregulated greatly in the tissues, including liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, and stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>), indicating that frog IL-10 should act an important role for resistance against bacterial infections. The upregulation of frog IL-10 expression in intestine and stomach also suggested the IL-10 might be involved in mucosal immune response in amphibian [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The number of IL genes and their types in the IL-10 loci from various species were different, for example, four ILs named as IL-10, -19, -20, and -24 in mammalian IL-10 locus, IL-10 and -19 in chicken IL-10 locus, and IL-10 and IL-20L in fish IL-10 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the present study, we identified two interleukins in frog IL-10 locus, that is, IL-10 and the homologue of IL-20/19. This homologue identified newly contained six conserved cysteine residues, which were found in mammalian IL-19 and -20 and fish IL-20L [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. On the contrary, there were four cysteine residues in most of IL-10s and two in human IL-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Sequence identities also supported that this novel IL was the homologue of mammalian IL-19/20. Its identities of 37.9% and 35.7%, respectively, with human IL-20 and zebrafish IL-20L were slightly higher than the values of identity with frog IL-10 and other IL-10 family members, ranging from 23.9% to 32.4% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The finding of IL-19/20 homologue in frog suggested that the divergence of IL-19 and IL-20 might occur after amphibian appearance during biological evolution. Of course, the function and the potential receptors of the homologue should be further studied to reveal its exact evolutionary position.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was finically supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 31302221 and 31272666) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK2011418) and sponsored by &#x0201c;Qing Lan&#x0201d; project of Jiangsu province of China.</p></ack><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Commins</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Steinke</surname><given-names>J.
