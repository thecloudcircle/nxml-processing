Movement artefacts (MA) in EEG signals originate from mechanical forces applied to the scalp electrodes, inducing small electrode movements relative to the scalp which, in turn, cause the recorded voltage to change irrespectively of cortical activity. These mechanical forces, and thus MA, may have various sources (e.g., ground reaction forces, head movements, etc.) that are inherent to daily activities, notably walking. In this paper we introduce a systematic, integrated methodology for removing MA from EEG signals recorded during treadmill (TM) and over-ground (OG) walking, as well as quantify the prevalence of MA in different locomotion settings. In our experiments, participants performed walking trials at various speeds both OG and on a TM while wearing a 32-channel EEG cap and a 3-axis accelerometer, placed on the forehead. Data preprocessing included separating the EEG signals into statistically independent additive components using independent component analysis (ICA). We observed an increase in electro-physiological signals (e.g., neck EMG activations for stabilizing the head during heel-strikes) as the walking speed increased. These artefact independent-components (ICs), while not originating from electrode movement, still exhibit a similar spectral pattern to the MA ICs&#x02013;a peak at the stepping frequency. MA was identified and quantified in each component using a novel method that utilizes the participant&#x02019;s stepping frequency, derived from a forehead-mounted accelerometer. We then benchmarked the EEG data by applying newly established metrics to quantify the success of our method in cleaning the data. The results indicate that our approach can be successfully applied to EEG data recorded during TM and OG walking, and is offered as a unified methodology for MA removal from EEG collected during gait trials.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1298-415.13/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plotnik</surname><given-names>Meir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1657-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plotnik</surname><given-names>Meir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1372-303.7/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8336-5141</contrib-id><name><surname>Bartsch</surname><given-names>Ronny P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006245</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Israel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3-12072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plotnik</surname><given-names>Meir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1657/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8336-5141</contrib-id><name><surname>Bartsch</surname><given-names>Ronny P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>We acknowledge financial support from the German Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development (Grant numbers I-1298-415.13/2015 to MP and I-1372-303.7/2016 to RPB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gif.org.il/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.gif.org.il/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>); the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant # 3-12072 to MP) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://archive.most.gov.il/English/Pages/default.aspx">http://archive.most.gov.il/English/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>); and the Israel Science Foundation (Grant numbers 1657-16 to MP and 1657/16 to RPB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.isf.org.il/">https://www.isf.org.il/</ext-link>).

The faint electrical signals arise from the joint activity of countless neurons, recorded using the EEG electrodes. Due to the delicate nature of the recorded signal it is easily overshadowed by various artefacts such as eye blinks, muscles activations, electromagnetic noise and movement artefacts[<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The latter practically constraining the modern EEG to be recorded only during stationary settings.</p><p>EEG signals recorded during gait activity reflect neural mechanisms associated with healthy or impaired leg movements[<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the past decade, EEG signals were recorded during treadmill (TM) walking [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], identifying a systematic modulation of EEG spectral amplitude during the gait cycle and coupling of EEG recordings and electromyography recorded from the lower limbs. Some of the studies involving EEG recordings during human locomotion addressed gait disturbances, for example, in persons with Parkinson's disease and in particular the debilitating phenomenon of freezing of gait[<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Due to the dynamic nature of the aforementioned experiments, much effort is involved in studying and removing movement artefacts [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with some studies concluding that more sophisticated tools are needed to properly clean gait-related artifacts [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It also became apparent that data preprocessing is an important first step for MA removal because of the inherent complexity of the EEG data. However, currently there are no EEG MA studies that utilize an advanced preprocessing tool (i.e., PREP pipeline [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) for improving the decomposition algorithm&#x02019;s (i.e., Independent Component Analysis (ICA)) performance. The field of ICA algorithms has also evolved, and today better decomposition algorithms are available [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The objective of this study was to remove EEG MA by developing a new framework that combines the most advanced algorithms in preprocessing and signal decomposition analysis with our own novel methodology for MA identification, and to test the results using recently published EEG benchmarking metrics [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Movement artefacts (MA) in EEG signals originate from mechanical forces applied on the scalp electrodes, inducing small electrode movements relative to the scalp which, in turn, cause the recorded voltage to change regardless of cortical activity. It was previously claimed that movement artifact should be removed in order to study electro-cortical activity during locomotion[<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, according to recent studies, EEG data recorded during walking is likely to contain substantial MA that cannot be removed using traditional signal processing methods[<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Various methods have been proposed for the removal of MA from EEG signals. Gwin et al., [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] first removed an MA template from the stride-epoched data using a 20-stride moving average, and then applied independent component analysis (ICA), a source-separation algorithm, to further clean the data. Leutheuser et al., [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] later compared two ICA algorithms, the common InfoMax as well as AMICA (Adaptive-Mixture ICA), in terms of their performance in reduction of EEG artefacts, and found that the AMICA algorithm outperformed the InfoMax. Later, Onikura et al. [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggested an ICA based method to remove head-movement MA by high pass filtering components whose temporal correlation coefficient with a head accelerometer crossed a predefined threshold. Kline et al. [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] tested the use of stride-locked moving average subtraction and Daubechies wavelet transform to remove walking MA of various speeds. Automatic subspace reconstruction (ASR) [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is another novel method for MA removal in which infected segments of the data are processed using baseline data and principal component analysis (PCA). While not all of the above methods were reported to successfully remove MA, they unanimously noted that caution should be exercised as not to remove neural data along with the MA, leading to subject specific thresholds, manual inspection, etc. In addition, they all utilized different benchmarking metrics for performance evaluation, an issue that was thoroughly addressed by Oliveira et al. [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who described metrics for benchmarking EEG technologies during whole body motion. In this paper we primarily introduce an integrated, novel methodology for removing MA from EEG signals recorded during treadmill (TM) and over-ground walking, as well as inspect the EEG signal for the prevalence of such artefact in different locomotion settings. We tested our proposed approach using state of the art benchmarking metrics [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and equipment. The methodology, that incorporates different parts of past studies while adding novelty of its own, was aimed at finding a fine line between retaining as much neural data as possible and reducing MA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>The study included 5 young, healthy adult (mean age &#x000b1; <italic>SD</italic>: 30.5 &#x000b1; 5.31) participants.

Where &#x02018;Power at ASF&#x02019; denotes the component&#x02019;s spectral peak at the average stepping frequency, and 'Low frequency power median' is the power spectral density&#x02019;s median in the 0&#x02013;5 Hz band. The MAP score is calculated as the ratio between a component&#x02019;s power at the stepping frequency and the median of the spectral power in the 0&#x02013;5 Hz band. Since components marked as MA are removed entirely we wanted to make sure little to no neural data was removed along with them. After inspecting many MA and non-MA ICs&#x02019; frequency spectra, we came to the conclusion that a ratio of 80 can serve as a classifying threshold aiming to remove components containing mostly MA while retaining as much neural data as possible. A MAP score of 80 means that there is 80 times more spectral power in the average stepping frequency compared to its surroundings in the 0&#x02013;5 Hz range (i.e., where most of the spectral power resides in non-MA components).</p><p>Additionally, we reviewed the power spectra of the different components and discovered another pattern of MA component spectra.

We utilized a metric described by Oliveira et al. called the walking/sitting (W/S) ratio [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The W/S ratio is calculated by dividing the spectral power in the 5&#x02013;80 Hz band, containing the theta (5&#x02013;8 Hz), alpha (9&#x02013;13 Hz), beta (13&#x02013;30 Hz) and gamma (30&#x02013;80 Hz) brain oscillations, of a walking trial by the spectral power in the same band of the sitting BL. The W/S Ratio determines changes in EEG spectral content related to movement where a ratio that is larger than 1 suggests the existence of MA in the EEG data and a W/S ratio smaller than 1 may indicate the EEG data were over-cleaned. We note, however, that although the W/S ratios should ideally be 1, this would require the same continuous electro-cortical activity between seated and walking conditions. Previous studies indicated a power drop in the alpha (9&#x02013;13 Hz) and beta (13&#x02013;30 Hz) brain oscillations during motor activity when compared to a resting baseline [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], as well as a related drop in W/S ratios during locomotion in a different study [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These explain why W/S ratios that are only slightly below 1 are not necessarily an indicator of over-cleaning. We utilized the previously described drop in alpha and beta power to assess the physiological validity of our results by calculating the W/S ratio specifically for the alpha and beta bands during the different walking trials, before and after the proposed MA-removal methodology was applied.</p><p>To compare our method to the current state-of-the-art in MA removal, we also cleaned the data using ASR and compared the results using the previously described benchmarking criteria. ASR applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the EEG data in a moving window, decomposing it into subspaces which are compared to a clean BL segment. The subspaces that are identified as noisy are reconstructed using an un-mixing matrix which was derived from the BL using PCA. By so, ASR automatically eliminates eye-blinks, muscle and movement artefacts. We referred to data prior to MA removal, data who&#x02019;s MA was cleaned using our proposed method and data pruned using ASR as &#x02018;Preprocessed&#x02019;, &#x02018;AMICA&#x02019; and &#x02018;ASR&#x02019;, respectively. The results of these comparisons were statistically analyzed using a two-way ANOVA by ranks (Related-samples Friedman&#x02019;s test) for comparing the different methods and walking speeds.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with the IBM SPSS statistics 21 software.

Currently there are no EEG MA studies, that utilize an advanced integrated preprocessing tool (i.e., PREP pipeline), which greatly affects the decomposition algorithm&#x02019;s (i.e., AMICA) performance. Our procedure was successfully applied for TM and OG walking alike, and is offered as a unified methodology for MA removal from EEG collected during gait trials.</p><p>In general, the proposed approach removes MA based on stepping frequency information. In order to substantiate this approach we began with presenting evidence pointing that there is, in fact, correlation between the frequency spectrum of the recorded, uncleaned, data from the EEG electrodes and the forces applied on the scalp during locomotion. Given the periodic nature of human locomotion, our analysis of the ICs&#x02019; frequency spectra serves as a straightforward and powerful way to detect and remove locomotion-originated MA. We also tested our methodology by applying it to data from baseline recordings with added artificial noise (i.e., simulating MA) and demonstrated that those artificial artefacts were successfully removed (see Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197153.s003">S3 File</xref>).</p><p>Our approach offers a systematic way of evaluating MA through the analysis of spectral components. We propose a full &#x02018;step by step&#x02019; approach from start to finish, as well as combine multiple state-of-the-art signal processing methods (i.e., PREP pipeline, AMICA) with our novel methodology for assessing and removing MA.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Cz electrode and accelerometer spectral properties</title><p>Since the Cz electrode is the most prone to MA, we decided to examine this electrode&#x02019;s power spectrum before and after MA removal to provide a worst-case scenario overview.</p><p>Looking at the vertical accelerometer data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g002">Fig 2</xref>, top row), it is apparent that the faster the participant walked, the more MA was induced to the EEG data (i.e., wider, taller spectral peaks at the stepping frequency; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g002">Fig 2</xref>, middle row). This can be observed by the increasing amplitude of the spectral peaks along with the walking speed. Additionally, it can be seen that OG walking leads to more MA compared to TM at similar speeds.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Differential considerations on MA removal for TM and OG walking</title><p>In the lowest speed, 0.4 m/s, MA was negligible (i.e., low MAP score) and therefore the power spectra of the preprocessed and MA-removed data are the same. The spectral peak in the stepping frequency grew as the TM&#x02019;s speed was increased, while the higher speeds proved to be harder to clean (i.e., more EMG and MA components detected). Additionally, OG walking trials were harder to clean than trials performed on the TM because of two reasons: (i) Higher GRFs while walking OG, compared to similar TM speeds, due to the TM&#x02019;s suspension dampening and (ii) The self-paced nature of OG walking results in small variations to the stepping frequency across the trial thus, providing a quasi-periodic signal that&#x02019;s harder for the AMICA algorithm to separate from the neural data. On par with other observations in this study, the Cz electrode frequency spectra show our proposed method was able to prune the data from MA in all TM walking speeds and provide a substantial improvement in TM running and OG locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>W/S ratios at various speeds and conditions</title><p>The W/S ratio, as seen growing alongside the walking speed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g004">Fig 4</xref>, offers an opportunity to examine the increase of spectral energy contents in the brainwaves band of EEG data recorded during locomotion. While at the lowest speed (i.e., 0.4 m/s), both pre and post MA removal ratios are close to 1, an increase at the W/S ratio is already apparent at 0.8 m/s, indicating the presence of MA in the EEG data. This increase further escalades intensely at higher speeds. The MA pruned data, on the other hand, presents ratios slightly below 1 for all walking speeds, both on the TM and OG, which is in line with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as well as studies that have demonstrated a reduction in alpha and beta power during motor activity [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>It can also be observed that the W/S ratio&#x02019;s standard deviation increased alongside the walking speed. These increasing SDs are a result of small differences in setup between subjects (i.e., small variations in the &#x0003c;20 impedance, different weight, walking style, sole cushioning, etc.). These differences, while miniscule at lower speeds, increase and hyper-manifest as the walking speed increases, and come to an extreme at OG locomotion. This points at how caution should be practiced when recording EEG during OG locomotion or TM running, due to the higher GRFs. We found no statistical difference in the performance at removing MA between our method and the current state-of-the-art (i.e., ASR). Nevertheless, our suggested method presents lower inter-electrode variance (i.e., smaller error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g004">Fig 4</xref>), which suggests a more homogeneous removal of MA across the scalp and thus cleaner EEG data.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>MA distribution across the scalp</title><p>Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g005">Fig 5</xref>, we see again how for the three TM-walking speeds, as well as the OG-regular, the proposed method is able to clean the data well while at the TM-running (i.e., 2.2 m/s) and OG-elevated trials some MA is still present in the signal. In the latter conditions, the MA constitutes a very large portion of the data. So much so, that the AMICA algorithm struggles to separate it from the neural data, resulting in mixed neural-MA components. This gives us an idea about the method&#x02019;s abilities and limitations in various walking conditions. Additionally, It can be seen how MA appears first (i.e., at lower speeds) mainly at the top of the scalp, in the area around the Cz electrode, and later spreads to the peripheral areas, consistent with prior studies[<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Alpha and beta bands analysis during motor activity</title><p>Past studies have demonstrated a link between motor activity and a reduction in the alpha and beta bands&#x02019; power of the recorded EEG [<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197153.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, a more prominent drop has been shown in the alpha band when compared to the beta band. This property can serve as a good physiological validity benchmark of the EEG data, both prior to and after the MA-removal process, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g006">Fig 6</xref>. Looking at the preprocessed-only data, an increase is evident in both the alpha and Beta bands&#x02019; normalized spectral power. ASR displayed better values compared to the preprocessed datasets, but on the other hand also presented an unexpected increase in power evident in the alpha band during TM trials at speeds of 1.6 m/s and above, as well as in the OG-elevated trial, which may originate from non-cortical artifacts.</p><p>Due to the slighter change in the beta band&#x02019;s power during motor activity, its power drop is more susceptible to MA as it diminishes in lower speeds then the drop in the alpha band&#x02019;s power (the power drop in the preprocessed data is diminished at 1.6 and 0.4 m/s for the alpha and beta bands, respectively). This delicate nature of the beta band also explains why it is first, and only, at displaying an increase in the MA-removed data (i.e., at the OG-elevated trial, which also displays the highest ratio after MA-removal).</p><p>The alpha and beta bands analysis shows how MA removal is important in order to reveal physiological changes in EEG that may be hidden beneath the MA. Moreover, our results demonstrate that MA removal is essential in order to detect physiological changes in EEG during locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Increased electro-physiological signals during higher speeds</title><p>An interesting observation we made using AMICA is how electro-physiological signals, such as the neck muscles activations as separated by the algorithm, increased with the walking speed. We presume these increasing activations are in order to stabilize the participant&#x02019;s head during heel strikes at the growing TM speeds. While these components do not originate from scalp electrodes movement, and thus will probably be categorized as EMG artefacts and removed at the preprocessing stage, they exhibit a power spectrum similar to the MA&#x02019;s&#x02013;a peak in the stepping frequency. This serves as an example of how physiological systems (e.g., muscles, heart rate, etc.) are engaged more intensively when walking faster&#x02013;therefore possibly introducing electro-physiological (i.e., non-MA) noise to the recorded EEG.</p><p>Thus, while our bodies engage physiological systems (e.g., muscles, heart rate, etc.) more intensively to walk faster, further care is needed to isolate the noise related to the elevated activity within the EEG signal and remove it, in order to obtain a signal that reflects primarily brain activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197153.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g004">Fig 4</xref>.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197153.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197153.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197153.g006">Fig 6</xref>.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197153.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197153.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary material.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197153.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ms. Livnat Corelenchtein for her assistance in data collection and analysis, as well as Mr. Amihai Gottlieb for helping with the statistical analysis.
