Though the cause of RA remains unknown, accumulating evidence indicates a critical role of Th17 cells in disease development in both experimental arthritis models and in human RA (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Recently, adipose tissue was recognized as an important endocrine organ. Adipose tissue plays an important role in the regulation of various physiological functions through the secretion of a number of adipokines. Adiponectin (AD) is the most abundant adipokine in the circulation, accounting for approximately 0.01% to 0.05% of total plasma proteins. Growing evidence suggests that AD plays a vital role in regulating immune and inflammatory processes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Previously, we showed that AD treatment markedly enhances Th17 cell generation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Our data provide robust evidence that AD participates in the regulation of Th17 response. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.</p><p>Na&#x000ef;ve T cells can differentiate into various T helper (Th) cells. During this process, metabolism reprogramming occurs to meet energy requirements and provide various indispensable substrates for T cell proliferation and differentiation. Manipulating metabolic pathways in T cells can shape their fate and function. Th17 cells mostly rely on aerobic glycolysis, a sequence of cytosolic enzymatic reactions that convert glucose into pyruvate, generating energy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In an autoimmune model of RA, inhibition of glycolysis can impact the Th17/Treg balance and reduce disease severity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>HIF, a heterodimer comprised of &#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) and &#x003b2; (HIF-1&#x003b2;) subunits, is a key transcription factor that orchestrates the expression of glycolytic enzymes. HIF-1&#x003b1; is up-regulated under Th17-polarizing conditions and promotes glycolysis during Th17 differentiation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). HIF-1&#x003b1; plays a dual role in Th17 development by directly activating Ror&#x003b3;t transcription and then associating with Ror&#x003b3;t at the IL-17A promoter to recruit p300 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies have shown that AD drives expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in synovial fibroblasts. Here, we hypothesize that the AD-HIF-1&#x003b1; pathway contributes to regulating Th17 response in the pathogenesis of RA. AD exerts its functions by acting on its receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2). AdipoR1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, while AdipoR2 is detected in the liver and quadriceps muscle. Previously, we have demonstrated that AD and AdiopR1 are more highly expressed in synovial tissues from patients with RA than in those from patients with osteoarthritis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Further, we confirmed that AdipoR1 is prominently expressed in T cells from patients with RA (unpublished data), suggesting that AdipoR1 is critically involved in synovitis and T cell response in RA.</p><p>In the present study, we generated CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell-specific AdipoR1 conditionally deficient mice to examine the role of AdipoR1 in Th17 cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and on AIA development. Our data indicate that loss of AdipoR1 reduces disease severity in AIA. Moreover, AdipoR1 -deficient T cells decrease Th17 differentiation through inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1;-dependent glycolysis in T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS2"><title>Mice</title><p>In order to obtain AdipoR1 lox mice, Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA and donor were co-injected into zygotes. sgRNA create DSBs (double-strand breaks) in intron 2-3 and intron 4-5.

When mating with Cre expression allele, sequence between two LoxP sites can be deleted in specific tissues or cells, so AdipoR1 gene will be disrupted by frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).

For analysis of proteoglycans, 5 &#x003bc;m sections were stained with Safranin O-fast green and counterstained with hematoxylin. For quantification of the number of osteoclasts, total knee joint sections were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), using the Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The percentage of TRAP + cells present along the external bone surface was counted. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a Vectastain ABC kit. Tissues were stained with anti-TNF-&#x003b1;, anti-IL-1&#x003b2;, anti-IL-6 antibodies and an isotype control (Proteintech).

We extended our previous studies and revealed that AdipoR1 regulates Th17 cell differentiation at least in part by modulating HIF-1&#x003b1;-mediated glycolysis in T cells. Our data highlight the relevance of AdipoR1 as a potential novel therapeutic target in RA.</p><p>The Th17 cell subset, which produces IL-17, is involved in the pathogenesis of RA with regard to synovial hypertrophy, enhanced osteoclastogenesis, and neoangiogenesis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Loss of AdipoR1 inhibited Th17 differentiation and reduced the production of IL-17. In our study, RNA-seq analysis identified seven genes and 14 transcription factors in the Th17 pathway that were significantly down-regulated in the KO group. To validate the RNA-seq results, we performed RT-PCR assays and identified <italic>Rorc</italic> (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma, Ror&#x003b3;) as the most DEG. <italic>Ror</italic>&#x003b3;<italic>t</italic> is a splicing variant of <italic>Rorc</italic>, and is mainly expressed in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes.

In the pathogenesis of RA, T cells start to proliferate and differentiate when stimulated. Metabolism reprogramming is crucial for meeting energy requirements and providing various substrates which are indispensable for T cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). After stimulation, CD4<sup>+</sup> na&#x000ef;ve T cells become highly proliferative and differentiate into Th cells. Then glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway, the hexosamine pathway, and fatty acid metabolism become active. Subtle differences in these metabolic programs will lead to CD4 + na&#x000ef;ve T cells differentiation into different T helper cell lineages (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

Lin-Yu Sun et al. reported that AdipoR1 is involved in the glucose metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

Our data show that glycolysis is reduced and Th17 cell proliferation and cytokine production are inhibited in the presence AdipoR1 KO mice.

VH298 inhibits HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation, leading to HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation. Ror&#x003b3;t expression and Th17 cell frequencies significantly increased with VH298 treatment in a dose dependent manner under Th17 polarization. Our data suggest that HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation could partially, but not completely, restore the ability of AdipoR1-deficent CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells to differentiate into Th17 cells.
