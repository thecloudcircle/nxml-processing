However, much mRNA degradation is cytoplasmic such that mRNA nuclear export must represent an important level of regulation. Ribosomal RNAs must also be exported from the nucleus and the trypanosome orthologue of NMD3 has been confirmed to be involved in rRNA processing and export, matching its function in other organisms. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion also generates mRNA accumulation of procyclin-associated genes (PAGs), these being co-transcribed by RNA polymerase I with the <italic>procyclin</italic> surface antigen genes expressed on trypanosome insect forms. By whole transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3-depleted cells we confirm the regulation of the <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts by <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 and using reporter constructs reveal that <italic>PAG1</italic> regulation is mediated by its 5&#x02032;UTR. Dissection of the mechanism of regulation demonstrates that it is not dependent upon translational inhibition mediated by <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion nor enhanced transcription. However, depletion of the nuclear export factors XPO1 or MEX67 recapitulates the effects of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion on <italic>PAG</italic> mRNAs and mRNAs accumulated in the nucleus of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3-depleted cells. These results invoke a novel RNA regulatory mechanism involving the NMD3-dependent nuclear export of mRNA cargos, suggesting a shared platform for mRNA and rRNA export.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>19 May 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="disclaimer" id="NT1"><p><bold>Disclaimer:</bold> The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The compartmentalization of nuclear DNA away from the translational apparatus in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells requires elaborate mechanisms to achieve the regulated export of RNA to enable gene expression (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The multiple stages of nuclear export provide several potential regulatory steps to ensure that RNAs of different function can be held inactive until fully matured, localized or targeted for cytoplasmic degradation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This prevents incorrectly or incompletely processed RNAs from perturbing normal cellular functions by interfering with important cellular processes, or generating products that would be deleterious to the cell (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Such RNAs can include nascent ribosomal RNA subunits, tRNAs, incorrectly processed mRNAs, nuclear RNAi targets that require trafficking to the cytoplasm for degradation, as well as bulk mRNAs. Hence, in addition to transcription, mRNA stability and translation, the export pathway for a variety of cellular RNAs provides considerable scope for the cell to control the expression and function of transcripts (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Such regulatory pathways have been extensively studied in both yeast and mammalian systems and include complex rRNA maturation and export steps (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of incorrectly processed mRNAs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>African trypanosomes provide an interesting opportunity to dissect the pathways of gene regulation in evolutionarily divergent organisms (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These organisms, important pathogens of humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, diverged very early in the eukaryotic lineage and exhibit several novelties of gene expression that have attracted considerable attention. This includes their co-transcription of functionally unrelated genes as part of polycistronic transcription units (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and their extreme reliance on post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene expression control necessitated by this genome organization (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Particularly, mRNAs are generated from polycistronic transcription units by the coupled processes of 5&#x02032; <italic>trans</italic>-splicing of a 39-nt capped leader sequence and 3&#x02032; polyadenylation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These RNA processing steps allow trypanosomes to exploit the transcription of protein coding genes by RNA polymerase I in order to generate the high levels of surface protein transcripts necessary for their survival or fitness in the mammalian bloodstream or tsetse fly midgut (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the tsetse midgut, the surface coat is composed of different isoforms of procyclin. These isoforms (EP procyclin, GPEET procyclin) show differential expression during the parasite's maturation in the tsetse fly (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and are transcribed from several transcription units on different chromosomes in the parasite genome (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These are transcribed by RNA polymerase 1 (pol I) and contain unrelated genes of unknown function, namely the procyclin-associated genes (PAGs)(<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). <italic>Procyclin/PAG</italic> genes are believed to be transcribed in the nucleolus since procyclic form parasites do not possess a detectable expression site body, an extranucleolar site of pol I transcription for the surface antigen genes of the bloodstream form (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Although <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts are generated from the same transcription unit as the <italic>procyclin</italic> genes, their overall mRNA abundance is much lower (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The understanding of regulated gene expression in trypanosomes through the action of protein factors remains very incomplete. Nonetheless, the trypanosome genome encodes an abundance of RNA binding proteins, many of which are unique to these evolutionarily divergent organisms (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The characterization of these kinetoplastid-specific factors has revealed a common role in mRNA stability and translation, often involved in regulating the development through the many stages that accompany progression of the parasites through their complex life cycle (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition to these specific factors, trypanosomatids also encode a core set of conserved protein factors with predicted functions in gene expression. These include many well characterized components of the translational machinery, as well as proteins associated with RNA processing, degradation and nuclear export (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In particular, bioinformatics analyses of the genomes of kinetoplastid parasites and other eukaryotic groups including a broad group of opisthokonta have revealed a general conservation of many components of the nuclear export machinery, which are responsible for the trafficking of cellular RNAs (rRNAs, mRNAs, tRNAs, miRNAs, snRNAs) to the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The Ran-GTP-dependent RNA export machinery is well conserved, with Ran orthologues in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> being over 70% identical to yeast and mammals and a divergent MEX67 orthologue with bulk mRNA export function has been recently characterized (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Moreover, there exists particular conservation of the rRNA export machinery, with XPO1 and <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 demonstrating over 50% similarity to their human counterparts. Other, more evolutionarily restricted components of this machinery, such as ArX1, Alb1p and PHAX, are not evident in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome but there are additional kinetoplastid-specific components that have been identified, most notably the developmentally regulated proteins P34/P37(<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and NOPP44/46(<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Hence, XPO1, <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 and P34/P37 and NOPP44/46 cooperate to process and export rRNA, demonstrating the role of both highly conserved, and parasite-specific, components in this fundamentally important export pathway (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have made the surprising discovery that post-transcriptional gene silencing by RNAi of trypanosome NMD3 results in a striking increase in <italic>PAG</italic> mRNAs in procyclic form trypanosomes, which is not mediated by the effects of NMD3 depletion on transcription, or translation. Rather, our results invoke a novel regulatory step dependent upon nuclear export of the mRNA, <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts representing an mRNA cargo with particular cytoplasmic instability whose trafficking is dependent on a nuclear export pathway conventionally involved in the maturation and export of large subunit ribosomal RNAs (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Trypanosomes culture</title><p>For developmental expression analysis using pleomorphic trypanosomes, pleomorphic slender cells were harvested from a mouse 3 days post-infection, intermediate cells were harvested 4 days post-infection and stumpy cells were harvested 6 days post-infection.

Since histone H3 levels were unchanged in the respective cell lines (Supplementary Figure S4B) this indicated that <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion could generate a slightly decreased histone H3 association at multiple loci, but that this was not specific for the <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts and so could not account for their relative elevation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>PAG regulation is mediated through the conserved 5&#x02032; untranslated region</title><p>The observation that <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts were upregulated in response to <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 RNAi prompted us to investigate whether <italic>PAG</italic> regulatory signals could be responsible.

Specifically we sought to block mRNA translation, transcription and RNA processing using Cycloheximide (CHX), Actinomycin D (ActD) and Sinefungin (SinF), respectively, in order to determine if any of these inhibitors would recapitulate or reverse the effect of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion on <italic>PAG</italic> transcript levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Supplementary Figures S5 and S6). Given the effect of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion on 60S rRNA processing and hence, potentially, translation we initially analysed the effect of Cycloheximide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, &#x02018;CHX&#x02019;). However, this generated no dramatic change in the profile or abundance of the <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts in <italic>Tb</italic>NMD RNAi cells, although the abundance of <italic>PAG</italic> mRNAs increased in the induced samples somewhat over time (the effect on other transcripts is shown in Supplementary Figure S5). Using Actinomycin D (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, &#x02018;Act D&#x02019;), in contrast, resulted in a loss of longer <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts and accumulation of a smaller major transcript at 1.8 kb (arrowed on Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, &#x02018;ActD&#x02019;), which then remained stable in both <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 RNAi induced and uninduced samples. This suggested that inhibiting transcription caused longer <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts to be processed to a shorter stable form or that longer isoforms were preferentially degraded, but this occurred irrespective of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 levels. Finally, we analysed the effect of inhibiting <italic>trans</italic>-splicing using Sinefungin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, &#x02018;SinF&#x02019;).

To assist visualization of any changed distribution, cells were induced for <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion by RNAi over 62 h, once growth was reduced but before significant cell death was observed in the population (Supplementary Figure S1). Thereafter, the distribution of polyA+ RNA was compared in the induced and uninduced populations using Cy3-OligodT, with an unlabelled OligoT blocking step providing a control for specificity of the signal. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows that the induced population showed &#x0223c;20% cells with a strong nuclear concentration of Cy3 OligodT signal 62 h after induction, contrasting with less than 1% in uninduced cells, where the distribution of signal was non-nuclear.

Since this global polyA+ mRNA analysis suggested that all mRNAs might be accumulated in the nucleus, rather than <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts specifically, we analysed the distribution of several mRNAs after cell fractionation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>).

This regulation generated &#x0223c;5- to 16-fold increases, whereas only a few other cellular mRNAs were strongly elevated or decreased under the same conditions. The <italic>PAG</italic> genes are located downstream of, and cotranscribed with, the <italic>EP</italic> and <italic>GPEET</italic> genes by RNA Pol I (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Despite this close linkage, <italic>EP</italic> and <italic>GPEET</italic> transcripts were only modestly up-regulated upon NMD3 depletion, perhaps because these transcripts are already &#x0223c;100-fold elevated over <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts.</p><p>The regulation of <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts and the effect of <italic>PAG</italic> sequences on adjacent gene transcripts are complex. <italic>PAG</italic> genes lack any significant 3&#x02032; UTR sequences with polyadenylation of <italic>PAG1</italic> occurring within 10 bases of the stop codon. Thus, regulation is believed to operate through their extensive 5&#x02032; UTR sequences and coding regions, which contribute to the low abundance of the <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts despite their transcription by RNA pol I (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Accordingly, the <italic>CAT</italic>-<italic>PAG</italic>1 5&#x02032; UTR reporter construct was up-regulated upon <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 RNAi, analogous to the regulation of the endogenous <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts, whereas a control mRNA was not significantly up-regulated. Hence, the observed regulation was specific to the <italic>PAG</italic> regulatory sequence but not dependent on the genomic location or the polymerase driving their transcription.</p><p>In order to investigate the basis of the upregulation of <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts in <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depleted cells, we analysed several steps in the gene expression pathway. Since analysis of the <italic>PAG</italic> 5&#x02032; UTR has demonstrated that it can act as a transcriptional silencer for nearby genes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) we examined the interaction between <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion and transcription, specifically the histone occupancy of the <italic>PAG</italic> genes and several additional genes. Although a slight general decrease in histone occupancy was observed, this was not specific for <italic>PAG</italic> genes and was observed across a wide range of genomic loci. Hence we do not consider that transcription is a significant contributor to the effects observed. Thereafter we examined the contribution of several post-transcriptional steps to the regulation of <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts in <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3-depleted cells. We investigated whether the role of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 in rRNA maturation and translation could have resulted in a feedback upregulation of <italic>PAG</italic> mRNA, perhaps as cells attempted to compensate for reduced <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 protein levels. However, CHX treatment did not generate an equivalent effect as <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion in uninduced cells. Similarly, when transcription was inhibited with Actinomycin D, the different length forms characteristic of the <italic>PAG</italic>1 transcripts were reduced to a major short transcript; however this was unrelated to <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion. Finally, to investigate the effect on mRNA processing via <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, we treated cells with Sinefungin. Interestingly, the up-regulation of <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts seen upon <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 RNAi was reversed within 1 h, suggesting that this drug can counteract the depletion of <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3, destabilizing the elevated <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts or preventing their accumulation.</p><p>Having ruled out a direct role for transcription, RNA processing or translation as being responsible for <italic>PAG</italic> gene upregulation, we next turned our attention to nuclear export. Given that NMD3 cooperates with XPO1/CRM1 to export rRNA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), we first investigated the effects of LMB on cells (an inhibitor of XPO1/CRM1 (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>)) and then XPO1 RNAi. This revealed that the phenotypes resulting from <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion were recapitulated, supporting functional nuclear export as the potential mechanism for <italic>PAG</italic> mRNA regulation. An involvement of XPO1/NMD3 in <italic>PAG</italic> regulation was a surprise since these molecules are known to cooperate in the export of rRNA but not mRNA. One explanation was that the <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts might be exported for degradation via a discrete pathway. The positioning of the <italic>PAG</italic> genes is often close to the boundary of divergent or convergent transcription units or where there is a switch from RNA pol I to pol II mediated transcription (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Although such regions have the potential to generate transcriptional overlap and resultant dsRNA, such that they might be templates for cytoplasmic RNAi mediated through the action of <italic>Tb</italic>AGO1 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), we consider this unlikely since <italic>PAG</italic> levels are not elevated in <italic>Tb</italic>AGO1 deficient cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> we present a model that incorporates our findings based on the pathway for <italic>PAG</italic> transcript maturation and degradation. In this model, nascent <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts would be rapidly processed to a range of mRNAs of different lengths, which are then exported via an NMD3/XPO1-dependent process to the cytoplasm, where they are rapidly degraded, generating their relatively low abundance. With NMD3, XPO1 or MEX67 depletion, the newly synthesized and processed <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts would accumulate in the nucleus. When transcription is inhibited with Actinomycin D the accumulated nuclear transcripts could undergo further cycles of slower processing or differential nuclear decay, generating a short transcript form stable in the nucleus, with longer forms no longer being generated <italic>de novo</italic>. In response to inhibition of splicing by Sinefungin, <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts could be degraded in the nucleus by the nuclear exosome (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Indeed, blocking <italic>trans-</italic>splicing may specifically activate the degradation of incompletely processed transcripts in the nucleus, thus preventing the export of deleterious aberrant mRNAs and explaining the reversal of <italic>PAG</italic> mRNA accumulation in NMD3-depleted Sinefungin-treated cells. This NMD3-dependent export pathway could preferentially target a subset of mRNAs, particularly the <italic>PAG</italic>s, explaining the apparent specificity of the accumulation of this transcript family. However our results favour a bulk export pathway, with <italic>PAG</italic> mRNAs preferentially accumulating due to their high turn over necessitated by their transcription as part of the pol I driven <italic>procyclin</italic> gene locus. This general mRNA export mechanism is supported by three lines of evidence. Firstly, <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion results in cells with an accumulation of polyA+ mRNA in the nucleus as detected by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Secondly, qRT-PCR of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNAs demonstrates that several transcripts become enriched in the nuclear fraction when <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 is depleted by RNAi. Finally, depletion of the bulk mRNA export factor MEX67 recapitulates the increase of <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts observed with <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 depletion (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Combined these observations support a role for <italic>Tb</italic>NMD3 in the export of RNAs from the nucleus in addition to their role in 60S rRNA export. We do not yet know if this entails formation of a shared, possibly transient, complex involving <italic>Tb</italic>NMD 3/XPO1 and <italic>Tb</italic>Mex67 or the passing of rRNA and mRNAs between distinct complexes which can interact or interfere functionally. Nonetheless, interaction between the pathway for rRNA and mRNA processing and transport matches a shared role of the recently identified nucleolar protein NRG1 in rRNA processing and <italic>GPEET</italic> expression control (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) and is consistent with LMB treatment of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> cells that generates nuclear mRNA accumulation, albeit with specificity for some mRNAs (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Model for the export and degradation pathway for <italic>PAG</italic> transcripts. The explanation of the model is provided in the manuscript text.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkv330fig9"/></fig><p>Our experiments suggest that trypanosomes exhibit a shared platform for the export of rRNA and mRNAs, analogous to the capacity for the bulk mRNA export MEX67-Mtr2 complex to contribute to the export of ribosomal rRNA subunits (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Indeed MEX67 can act as a suppressor of NMD3 mutants in yeast, underscoring the potential for functional overlap between rRNA and mRNA export in eukaryotic cells. This overlap may be particularly relevant for abundant RNAs where a quantitative export is necessary for their function or targeted elimination in the cytoplasm, or be necessary in trypanosomes where bioinformatics analysis suggests the presence of a reduced set of nuclear export proteins. Moreover, such nuclear export pathways could be a control step generating the differential abundance of co-transcribed transcripts. Whether this also has a regulatory function whereby the export of individual transcripts can be tuned depending on the physiological demands on the parasite, or developmental cues, represents an exciting area of future study.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBER</title><p>RNA-Seq data in this manuscript have been submitted to the GEO database with the accession number GSE67246.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkv330/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
