The strains were chosen to represent food and clinical isolates and to be equally distributed between the most relevant clonal complexes for clinical and food isolates (CC1 and CC6 vs CC121 and CC9), plus one group of eight strains of rare clonal complexes. Human-associated CC1 had a faster maximal growth rate than the other major complexes, and the lag time of CC1 and CC6 was significantly less affected by the addition of 4% NaCl to the medium. Food-associated CC9 strains were hypohemolytic compared to other clonal complexes, and all strains found to be resistant to increased concentrations of benzalkonium chloride belonged to CC121 and were positive for Tn6188 carrying the <italic>qacH</italic> gene. Lactic acid affected the survival of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> more than HCl, and there was a distinct, strain specific pattern of acid tolerant and sensitive strains. Strains from CC6 and human clinical isolates are less resilient under acid stress than those from other complexes and from food.

Lactic acid is an important preservative in the food industry, and is often added to meat or fish in the form of potassium or sodium lactate. In addition, lactic acid is naturally present in dairy products through fermentation. The relatively common use of a low pH as a preservative measure in food may exert a selective pressure that explains the higher likelihood of food isolates to be acid tolerant. Interestingly, human clinical isolates were significantly less resilient under acid stress. The low pH in the mammalian stomach is achieved by the secretion of HCl and is an important &#x0201c;first line of defense&#x0201d; mechanism against pathogens entering the body. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> is capable of surviving acidic conditions as low as pH 2.5 for 2&#x02009;h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons or insertion sequences are likely candidates to explain phenotypic patterns that refuse to align with any classification systems derived from the genome such as lineage or CC. It is tempting to speculate their involvement in the pattern observed here and in other studies. Bacteria faced with the challenge of an increased concentration of H+ ions have the options of (i) consuming H+ ions through decarboxylation reactions, (ii) exporting H+ ions through pumps and (iii) repairing the damage resulting from low pH, for instance mediated by heat shock proteins.

To hedge for differences in different batches of human blood obtained at different days, &#x0201c;date&#x0201d; was used as random effect. Lsmeans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> was used to create contrasts and p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 0.05. Since there were generally no differences in phenotype between strains isolated from food vs clinical sources, they are only discussed in the results section where source was identified as a predictor of the phenotype.</p><p id="Par41">All statistical analysis can be obtained as supplementary materials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
