</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par23">Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is characterized by clinical and laboratory signs of brain damage after perinatal asphyxia. It has an incidence of 2.5 per 1000 live births and associates with high rates of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cerebral hypoxic ischemia induces a strong neuroinflammatory response. After the primary insult, a cascade of events evolves to delayed cellular death that extends over several days. Apoptosis features particularly prominently in this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This biphasic pattern of neuronal death represents a window of opportunity for treatment such as therapeutic hypothermia, which is today the standard treatment for neonates with HIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, while hypothermia is an effective treatment strategy, there is still an urgent need for additional novel interventions that protect the neurons from secondary damage and improve the clinical outcome.</p><p id="Par24">The pathophysiology of HIE is not fully understood, but several studies suggest that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway involving the transmembrane death receptor Fas (CD95/Apo-1) and its natural ligand Fas-ligand (FasL) plays a central role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is supported by several other studies. First, Fas receptor expression is upregulated in the brain during hypoxia, and mice that lack functional Fas receptors are protected from HIE brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Second, after head trauma in adults, Fas receptor and FasL are expressed in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Third, preterm infants with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus have increased levels of soluble Fas receptor (sFas) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the concentration correlates with the extent of white matter damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Evidence from experimental research indicates that inflammation and the associated production of inflammatory mediators play a significant role in the pathophysiology of brain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is particularly interesting because its production in the post-hypoxic inflammatory cascade has been reported to have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The neurotoxicity of IL-6 is demonstrated by the fact that, in infants with HIE, increased IL-6 levels, in both serum and CSF, correlate positively with brain injury severity and the clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The neuroprotective effect of IL-6 is exemplified by its ability to protect cerebral granular neurons from <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity in vitro (9) and the fact that IL-6 injections into the brain after ischemia reduce ischemic brain injury (10). These opposing roles of IL-6 may reflect different functions at different stages of brain ischemia damage: specifically, it may mediate destructive inflammation during the acute phase while enhancing regeneration of the nerves in the subacute and prolonged phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">We hypothesized that FasL and IL-6 are upregulated in CSF samples from human infants after perinatal asphyxia and that they may correlate positively with the severity of HIE and the clinical outcome of patients. To address this, infants with HIE were compared with control infants with suspected infection in terms of FasL and IL-6 levels in the CSF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par27">This study was performed in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of Helsinki 1975 and its revision in 1983 and European Community guidelines.

HIE was classified as mild (HIE-I), moderate (HIE-II), or severe (HIE-III) according to the criteria of Sarnat and Sarnat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">All patients were treated under normothermic conditions and received standard treatment at the time of recruitment. This included fluid restriction, ionotropic support, and mechanical ventilation when needed as well as medical treatment for seizure activity. Continuous amplitude-integrated EEG was used to assess brain activity and suspected seizures. Given the clinical routine at the time of patient recruitment, all patients with moderate to severe encephalopathy underwent computed tomography (CT) brain scans and, in some cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the third to fifth day of life.</p><p id="Par35">All surviving patients were monitored with full neurological examinations at 3, 6, and 18&#x000a0;months of age that were conducted by an experienced neuropediatrician.

The CSF concentrations of IL-6, FasL, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and the soluble form of the Fas receptor (sFas) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diaclone Research, Besan&#x000e7;on, France). The detection limits were 2&#x000a0;pg/mL (IL-6 and IL-6R), 12&#x000a0;pg/mL (FasL), and 47&#x000a0;pg/mL (sFas). The results were normalized against total protein content, which was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). In some patients and controls, competition enzyme immunoassays were used to measure prostaglandin E2 metabolite (PGEM). The assay was performed according to a commercial standardized protocol (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

Correlations between variables were determined using the Spearman rank correlation test. In terms of categorical variables, the groups were compared using the chi-squared test. A graphical plot, namely, the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve, was used to evaluate the ability of biomarkers to classify disease status and outcome. The maximum effectiveness of the biomarkers was evaluated using the Youdan Index. To evaluate the potential advantage of combining the FasL and IL-6 concentrations to identify degree of HIE and final outcome, we ranked the values of IL-6 and FasL.

This suggests that IL-6 may have biphasic roles in the pathogenesis of hypoxic brain injury: it induces inflammation and injury early after the insult but then contributes to cytokine-mediated repair at later time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">In the present study, the patients did not receive therapeutic hypothermia because it was not an established therapy for HIE at the time of recruitment. We found that, in the 12 patients who underwent LP at two separate time points after birth, the IL-6 levels were lower in the second sample in all but three cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). This is consistent with previous observations, regarding normothermic patients where serum IL-6 levels after birth asphyxia were characterized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. All patients in the present study who exhibited a drop in IL-6 levels had adverse 18-month outcomes. Two of the three patients who had increased IL-6 levels between first and second LP had normal outcomes. However, those patients had low IL-6 levels in the first sample and the rise was small (9.9&#x000a0;pg/mL, 9&#x02013;10.5 in LP1 and 63.3&#x000a0;pg/mL, 59.5&#x02013;67 in LP2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p><p id="Par66">It should be noted that we measured IL-6 levels in the CSF, whereas several studies measure the serum IL-6 levels, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The fact that our findings closely resemble those of normothermic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] probably reflects the fact that the serum and CSF concentrations of IL-6 in term infants with asphyxia correlate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">A systematic review of potential brain injury biomarkers identified serum IL-6 as one of the few independent predictors of adverse outcome in survivors of HIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, CSF IL-6 may be a better predictor of adverse outcomes because local cytokine profiles are often poorly reflected in the plasma: this is because the plasma levels can also be shaped by secondary reactions to the injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Intracellular cytokine levels, which closely reflect cytokine production at a cellular level and show more stable kinetics in time, have recently been analyzed in term infants requiring systemic hypothermia after perinatal asphyxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In that study, intracellular IL-6 levels in CD4+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells peaked at 24&#x000a0;h post-asphyxia. However, IL-6 levels exhibited a large variability and did not differ between the two patient groups moderate (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) and severe (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) asphyxia. Thus, IL-6 plays an important role in the initial inflammatory response, but determination of CSF levels of IL-6 might better predict adverse outcomes in survivors of HIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">IL-6 initiates a signal transduction cascade by binding to specific IL-6 membrane receptors (IL-6R). Apoptosis associates with the shedding of membrane components, including IL-6R, which then facilitates IL-6 signaling in neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While most brain cells are not responsive to IL-6 alone, they can be stimulated by IL-6 bound to a soluble form of IL-6 receptor in a process called trans-signal activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The present study showed that the HIE patients had high concentrations of IL-6R in all samples whereas the IL-6R levels in all control infants were below the detection limit. It is possible that the high levels of IL-6R in the CSF of the HIE patients reflect an apoptotic process that is taking place in the brain at the time the samples were gathered. Unfortunately, the CSF samples were limited in volume, which meant that the IL-6R measurements were not accurate enough to assess the relationship between IL-6R levels and long-term outcomes.</p><p id="Par70">This study showed that FasL, which plays a key role in apoptosis, also correlated positively with both the HIE grade (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and the adverse long-term outcomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) in HIE patients. Experimental studies suggest that hypothermia blocks the Fas-mediated intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; however, clinical studies are needed to confirm this. The naturally occurring soluble form of Fas receptor, sFas, prevents cell ligation with FasL, and this blocking of FasL inhibits neuronal cell apoptosis in experimental brain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. sFas has been found in the CSF from neonates with hydrocephalus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but in that study, FasL was not detected. We found that, while none of the control infants had sFas in their CSF, 7 of 26 HIE patients had high levels and that all but one of these had adverse outcomes at 18&#x000a0;months. This suggests that CSF sFas may not actually protect HIE infants from FasL-induced apoptosis and the consequent poor outcomes.</p><p id="Par71">Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is another important mediator of neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. PGE2 and its derivative PGEM rapidly increase during hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We found that IL-6 levels in the CSF correlated positively with the PGEM levels in the CSF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, since only a subgroup of the patient cohort was examined for both PGEM and IL-6, and we have already established that increased levels of PGEM in CSF correlate positively with the clinical outcome of infants with HIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we thus focused our further analyses on FasL and IL-6.</p><p id="Par72">Our ROC curve analyses showed that IL-6 and FasL in the CSF may be useful as additional tools for evaluating the severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in post-asphyxiated infants and for predicting the long-term outcomes. First, this study showed that FasL (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.89) and IL-6 (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.87) predict HIE grade even better than cord blood pH (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80). When FasL and IL-6 were combined, they predicted HIE grade particularly well (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94). Second, FasL (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.90) and IL-6 (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86) predicted adverse outcomes better than cord blood pH (0.86). This performance was even better when FasL and IL-6 were combined (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94).</p><p id="Par73">Notably, this novel and unprecedented results of prediction for HIE and long-term outcome, using CSF biomarkers, could help guide treatment decisions. Thus, prospective studies concerning the benefits of CSF cytokine measurements also in hypothermic treated patients would indeed be of value.</p><p id="Par74">The main limitation of this study was the time lapse between patient recruitment and the presentation of the results. However, the fact that the patients were recruited before hypothermia became the standard treatment for HIE could be considered an advantage because it allowed us to compare our FasL and IL-6 findings in that setting with the findings of other studies, which were all conducted after therapeutic hypothermia was introduced as a standard treatment. Another limitation is that, while an experienced pediatric neurologist performed the routine clinical follow-up on all post-asphyxiated children at the Karolinska Hospital at that time, only the patients with neurological symptoms or signs at 18&#x000a0;months were assessed with the Bayley developmental evaluation assessment: the patients without signs did not undergo BSID-II scoring. Further studies on the diagnostic benefits of monitoring FasL and IL-6, with or without other biomarkers, in newborn infants with HIE who are treated with therapeutic hypothermia are warranted. Further studies on these biomarkers may also shed more light on the pathology of brain damage and determine whether targeting them may be of therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par75">IL-6 and FasL are released into the CSF during birth asphyxia. These biomarkers support the clinical diagnosis of HIE degree, thus correlating to the degree of brain injury, and are useful for predicting the long-term clinical outcome. Thus, they may aid the early decision-making regarding treatment of asphyxiated newborns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
