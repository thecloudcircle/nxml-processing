Here, the circumstances under which one strategy might be favored over the other are explored in the case of lattice models of proteins and then generalized and discussed with regard to real proteins. The balance between positive and negative design of proteins is found to be determined by their average &#x0201c;contact-frequency&#x0201d;, a property that corresponds to the fraction of states in the conformational ensemble of the sequence in which a pair of residues is in contact. Lattice model proteins with a high average contact-frequency are found to use negative design more than model proteins with a low average contact-frequency. A mathematical derivation of this result indicates that it is general and likely to hold also for real proteins. Comparison of the results of correlated mutation analysis for real proteins with typical contact-frequencies to those of proteins likely to have high contact-frequencies (such as disordered proteins and proteins that are dependent on chaperonins for their folding) indicates that the latter tend to have stronger interactions between residues that are not in contact in their native conformation. Hence, our work indicates that negative design is employed when insufficient stabilization is achieved via positive design owing to high contact-frequencies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Most proteins are functional only in their native states. The stability of the native state of proteins is, therefore, of paramount importance both <italic>in vivo</italic> and for many biotechnological applications <italic>in vitro</italic>. Protein stability is determined by the difference between the free energies of the native and non-native states. It follows that protein stabilization can be achieved via two different strategies: (i) &#x02018;positive design&#x02019; by introducing favorable interactions between residues in contact in the native state; and (ii) &#x02018;negative design&#x02019; by introducing unfavorable interactions between residues in contact in the non-native states. Here, we ask when is one strategy favored over the other. We show that &#x02018;positive design&#x02019; is favored when interactions that stabilize the native state are rarely found in the non-native states whereas &#x02018;negative design&#x02019; is favored when the interactions that stabilize the native state are also common in the non-native states. We also show that correlated mutations, i.e. mutations at one site that compensate for effects of mutations at other sites, tend to be associated with &#x02018;negative design&#x02019;.

Positive design can be achieved by introducing favorable pairwise interactions between residues that are in contact in the native state whereas negative design can be achieved by introducing unfavorable pairwise interactions between residues that are in contact in non-native conformations of the protein. The factors that favor employing one strategy over the other (or some combination of both strategies) are not known. For example, it is possible that certain features of a protein's native structure such as its secondary structure content or contact-order <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Plaxco1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> bias the choice of which particular strategy is employed. Here, we explore this question with respect to lattice models of proteins and then show that the principles that we have discovered also apply to real proteins. Although lattice models of proteins ignore many important details, they have been used successfully for elucidating general principles of protein folding and stability <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Dill1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Unger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and addressing evolutionary questions <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Zeldovich1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In particular, such models have the advantage that in certain cases all the possible conformations in the ensemble can be enumerated and, therefore, preferential design strategies for certain protein conformations may be identified.</p><p>The stability, dynamics and function of proteins are determined by both short- and long-range pairwise interactions. Long-range interactions are manifested, for example, in the energetic coupling between distant ligand-binding sites in allosteric proteins owing to conformational changes that are propagated from one site to another. The strength of both direct (short-range) and indirect (long-range) pairwise interactions can be analysed experimentally using the double-mutant cycle (DMC) method <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Horovitz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recently, we introduced a computational version of DMCs for analysis of pairwise interactions in lattice models of proteins <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Computational DMC analysis can be easily employed in an exhaustive manner to determine the strength of interaction between all possible residue pairs in a lattice model in contrast with experimental DMC analysis that must be restricted to a relatively small number of residue pairs owing to the prohibitive amount of work involved. Using this computational DMC approach, we previously discovered that the strength of both short- (i.e. between residues in contact in the native state) and long-range (i.e. between residues not in contact in the native state) pairwise interactions changes in a linear fashion with increasing &#x02018;contact-frequency&#x02019;, a term defined for each pair of residues in a sequence that corresponds to the fraction of states in the conformational ensemble of the sequence in which that pair of residues are in contact <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Chan2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In other words, a pair of residues that are in contact in many conformations available to the chain has a high contact-frequency whereas a pair of residues that are rarely in contact has a low contact-frequency. A protein fold can, therefore, be characterized by the average contact frequency of all the residue pairs in contact in that fold. Here, we show for lattice models that positive design is favored when this average &#x02018;contact frequency&#x02019; is low whereas negative design is favored when this average &#x02018;contact frequency&#x02019; is high. A mathematical derivation of this result indicates that it is general and, thus, likely to hold also for real proteins.</p><p>Negative design in the lattice models is also found to be associated with a higher incidence, on average, of correlated mutations, i.e. mutations at one site that tend to be accompanied by other mutations at a second site. Correlated mutations are assumed to be due to selective pressure to maintain protein structure or function and have, therefore, been used for prediction of 3D protein structure <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Gbel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Neher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, allosteric pathways <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Lockless1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Kass1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and protein-protein interactions <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Pazos1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Weigt1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and in protein design <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Socolich1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Correlated mutations in real proteins, however, also reflect common ancestry <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Wollenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Noivirt1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> whereas in our lattice models this concern is obviated. Here, by applying correlated mutation analysis we show that proteins likely to have a higher average &#x02018;contact-frequency&#x02019;, such as disordered proteins, also have a higher incidence of correlated mutations. These results strengthen our conclusion that &#x02018;contact-frequency&#x02019; is an important factor in determining the design strategy of real proteins.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. First, we show that the effects on stability of positive and negative design in lattice models are both linearly dependent, but with opposite sign, on the contact-frequency and that there is a strong trade-off between them. We then provide a general (not lattice specific) mathematical derivation supporting these claims. An analysis of correlated mutations in sequences selected for stability of a lattice fold that follows next shows that the density of correlated mutations increases with increasing contact-frequency. Finally, we show that a similar trend is likely to exist in real proteins by analyzing correlated mutations in proteins that fold with difficulty and are suspected to have higher contact-frequencies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Selection in lattice models</title><p>Sets of 25 residue-long sequences that share a particular native state were generated with and without selection for native state stability. The native states of the sets that were formed (termed SBSS) correspond to each of the 1081 compact folds on a 5&#x000d7;5 lattice. The average perturbation energy (&#x00394;&#x00394;G<sub>per</sub>) was then calculated for each pair of positions i and j in an alignment and the difference, D<sup>(i,j)</sup>, in the average perturbation energies for that pair of positions in the alignments with and without selection was determined. The average value of D<sup>(i,j)</sup> was then calculated for all pairs of positions in contact in a particular native conformation, &#x0003c;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&#x0003e;<sub>short</sub>, and for all pairs that form long-range interactions in that conformation, &#x0003c;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&#x0003e;<sub>long</sub>. Two positions are defined as forming a long-range interaction in a particular conformation if there is no path formed by residues in contact in that conformation that connects them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000592.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For example, if residue A is in contact with residue B and residue B is in contact with residue C then we do not consider residues A and C to be involved in a long-range interaction. Hence, the number of long-range interactions varies slightly between folds since the paths that connect residues in contact depend on the specific conformation. In the case of a compact conformation on a 5&#x000d7;5 lattice, the number of long-range interactions is 108<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>3 whereas the number of pairs in contact is always 16. It is important to note that all pairs of positions with a contact-frequency of zero (in the case of a square lattice, for example, residues at positions with the same parity cannot be in contact) are not considered in this analysis since their &#x00394;&#x00394;G<sub>per</sub> equals zero by definition. The values of &#x0003c;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&#x0003e;<sub>short</sub> of different folds were found to be correlated with their respective average contact-frequencies (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g001">Figure 1</xref> that the value of &#x0003c;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&#x0003e;<sub>short</sub> decreases when the corresponding value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for that fold increases (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.608; <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.0001). Smaller values of &#x0003c;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&#x0003e;<sub>short</sub> reflect a smaller contribution of pairs in contact to the gain in stability upon selection. Surprisingly, we discovered that some native states have zero or even negative &#x0003c;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&#x0003e;<sub>short</sub> values. Such values are found when the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e004.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is large.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g003">3</xref> for a specific lattice model prompted us to examine whether a general derivation can be obtained for the linear dependence of the contributions of positive and negative design to protein stability on contact-frequency. The starting point for the following such derivation is the previously derived <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> linear relationship between the perturbation energy and Boltzmann-weighted contact-frequency:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e008.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where E<sub>c</sub> is the energy of a contact that was removed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000592-t001">Table 1</xref> in <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e009.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (Z is the ensemble of all possible conformations and E(C) is the energy of a conformation), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e010.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (E(N) is the energy of the native state), &#x003bb; is the contact energy of the residue types found at positions i and j (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000592-t001">Table 1</xref> in <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>), <italic>T</italic> is the temperature and <italic>k</italic> is the Boltzmann constant. The Boltzmann-weighted contact-frequency, BWCF(i, j), is calculated by multiplying each occurrence of a contact by the Boltzmann weight of the conformation in which it occurs. Eq.

Given an alignment of sequences with the same native fold, one may express the average perturbation energy for a pair of positions i and j in the alignment, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e014.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, as follows:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e015.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>The difference, D<sup>(i,j)</sup>, in the average perturbation energies with and without selection was determined for every relevant pair of positions in the alignments.

The average of D<sup>(i,j)</sup> over all the pairs of positions i and j that form direct short-range native-state contacts, &#x0003c;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&#x0003e;<sub>short</sub>, can therefore be written using Eq.

An expression similar to Eq.

Given that the calculation of the contact-frequency parameter for a large number of real proteins is impractical owing to the huge size of their conformational spaces, we decided to look into groups of proteins for which there is good reason to assume that their average contact-frequency is high. We analysed two sets of proteins that are likely to have a high average contact-frequency of their contacts. The first set contains intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUP) that populate many conformations and are, therefore, likely to have relatively high values of contact-frequency since individual contacts probably stabilize many different conformations. The second set is based on the GroEL-interacting proteins found by Hartl and co-workers <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Kerner1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These proteins were divided into classes I to III with increased dependency on the GroE chaperonin system for folding correctly <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Kerner1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. A possible reason that these proteins have low folding propensities is their relatively high contact-frequency. In addition, we generated a third set of proteins as a control (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) for the other sets. Given that structural information is not available for disordered regions of proteins and, also, for many of the other sequences, we could not distinguish here between correlated mutations at positions involved in short-range contacts and those involved in long-range interactions. However, this does not affect our conclusions as the fraction of correlated mutations at positions in contact is lower than 20&#x00025; <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Noivirt1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and is likely to be approximately equal in all the sets. Hence, the variation in the densities stems mostly from the long-range correlations.</p><p>The distributions of correlated mutation densities calculated using the tree-based method <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Noivirt1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g005">Figure 5</xref> for the sequence alignments based on the set of disordered proteins, the three classes of GroEL-dependent proteins and the set of other randomly chosen control proteins (equal in number to that of the IUP-based set).

It can be seen that the average density of correlated mutations is lowest in the case of the control set of proteins, it is higher in the case of the three classes of GroEL-dependent substrates (and increases from class I to III) and is highest for the IUP-based set. This trend is observed only when comparing the average correlated mutation densities of the sets but it is important to note that correlated mutation analysis of real proteins is much noisier than that of lattice model proteins due to the larger alphabet size, errors in sequence alignment and evolutionary background and, therefore, these observations are significant. It should also be noted that fewer correlations were obtained in the case of real proteins as compared with lattice models as the former were detected using the tree-based method that was developed to filter out evolutionary noise and is more stringent.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000592-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Distributions of correlated mutation densities in the case of the five different sets of real proteins examined in this study.</title><p>The densities of correlated mutations were calculated for the sets of control proteins (A), classes I (B), II (C) and III (D) of the GroEL-interacting proteins and the intrinsically unstructured proteins (E).

It is important to note that mutations that affect short-range interactions tend to have much larger effects on stability than those that affect long-range interactions <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, suggesting that positive design should be much more common than negative design. However, we find that some folds underwent stabilization by using only negative design. This unexpected result indicates that positive design has limited ability to stabilize certain folds and that negative design compensates for that in cases of such folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Our results show that folds that can be stabilized by both positive and negative design are distinguished from those that are stabilized mostly by negative design in their average contact-frequency. Folds with low contact-frequency can be stabilized by both positive and negative design whereas those with high contact-frequency can be stabilized mostly by negative design. These results suggest that contact-frequency determines the stabilization potential of different folds and that certain folds are, therefore, more likely to emerge under difficult folding conditions such as extreme temperatures.</p><p>The analysis in this paper is based on the premise that stabilization of short-range contacts reflects positive design whereas stabilization of long-range interactions reflects negative design. In lattice models, this assumption is correct since the energy of any native state is determined only by its contacts and, therefore, any stabilization due to long-range interactions must stem from destabilization of non-native states (i.e. negative design). In the case of real proteins, however, this assumption is not necessarily correct since long-range (e.g. electrostatic) interactions can also stabilize the native state. However, the correlated mutation results that we obtained for both the lattice models and real proteins showed the same trend and, therefore, we assume that the correlated mutations that are mostly between distant positions reflect negative design.</p><p>It is interesting that two different mechanisms for thermostabilization have also been revealed by comparing mesophilic proteins with their thermophilic homologs <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Berezovsky2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. One mechanism termed &#x0201c;structure-based&#x0201d; is reflected in structure compactness and appears in proteins that originated in extreme environments. The second mechanism termed &#x0201c;sequence-based&#x0201d; is reflected in a bias of the amino acid composition toward more charged residues and is found in proteins that originated as mesophiles but later had to adapt to higher temperatures. Hence, both the findings here and the work of Berezovsky <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Berezovsky2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> indicate that certain structural (e.g. topological) features of proteins dictate their stabilization potential and that tinkering with sequence can compensate for the lack of such structural features. Thermostability has been attributed previously to amino acid composition <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Puigb1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000592-Zeldovich2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> but by having all the lattice model sequences in our work share the same composition we were able to identify a purely structural basis for stabilization.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study we subjected lattice model proteins to selection for stability and showed that the balance between positive and negative design strategies differs for each fold and depends on the average &#x02018;contact-frequency&#x02019; of that fold. The use of negative design is found to increase with increasing values of the average &#x02018;contact-frequency&#x02019; of the respective fold. Our results, therefore, indicate that each fold has its own stabilization potential that limits its ability to adapt to extreme conditions. We also showed that negative design in lattice models can be identified by correlated mutation analysis and is reflected in higher values of correlated mutation densities. This trend was also found in correlated mutation analysis of real proteins when comparing intrinsically unfolded proteins and chaperonin-dependent protein substrates to other control proteins. Thus, we conclude that stabilization of real proteins with high values of average contact-frequency tends to rely more on negative design and is reflected in higher densities of correlated mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>The lattice model of proteins</title><p>A 2D lattice model similar to the one described before <xref rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> was used.

Sets of the first type can be generated easily by classifying random sequences to different SBSS according to their native conformation. Sets of the second type could not be generated rapidly using this simple procedure and, therefore, we used a Monte Carlo (MC) maximization process of the following function:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000592.e041.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>where N<sub>c</sub> and N<sub>non</sub> are the total number of contacts and non-contacts in the specific conformation, respectively.
