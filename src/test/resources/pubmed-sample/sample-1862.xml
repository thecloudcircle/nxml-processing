This may involve either the ophthalmic artery end vessels, supplying the facial tissues (well-known supraorbital, supratrochlear and dorsal nasal as well as the lesser known branches of the ophthalmic artery via the lacrimal artery - the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal arteries that emerge through facial foramina towards the skin). This intravascular injection may also involve anastomotic connections of the external carotid artery with the ophthalmic end vasculature. Most notabe examples are via the angular branch of the facial artery but also the transverse facial via zygomaticofacial, superficial temporal frontal branch and deep temporal via the zygomaticotemporal arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). A column of filler, pushed via the filler syringe plunger against the prevailing arterial blood pressure of the ophthalmic artery, would appear to be a necessary prerequisite to visual loss.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Once the column of filler has filled the ophthalmic artery (or its anastomoses) past the origin of the central retinal artery and ciliary vessels, these vessels are essentially occluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). A release of the plunger pressure may also allow the filler to obstruct these vessels carried forward by the usual blood pressure and direction of flow. It has been suggested that at least 0.04 to 0.12 cc needs to be injected to backfill the supratrochlear arteries to the origin of the central retinal artery.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Retrograde flow from the supratrochlear artery into the ophthalmic artery was successfully shown in a cadaveric study. In this paper, 6 fresh cadavers had their arterial systems pressurized somewhat less than 120 mmHg with a plasma-based perfusate. In 3 of 6 cadavers, retrograde flow into and filling the ophthalmic artery was shown following cannulation of the superficial branch of the supratrochlear artery (average depth, 1.5 mm; average diameter, 1.42 mm) and injection of a hyaluronic acid filler. This retrograde filling required an average injection pressure of 166.7 mmHg (range, 160-180 mmHg).<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The ophthalmic artery system arises from the internal carotid artery and the danger zones are associated with the end vessels that supply facial tissues or via anastomotic connections of the external carotid system with the ophthalmic end vasculature. The ophthalmic artery (OA) end vessels are the supraorbital (SOA), supratrochlear (STA), dorsal nasal artery (DNA), and lesser recognized zygomaticofacial (ZF) and zygomaticotemporal (ZT) that both arise from the lacrimal artery (LA). Not demonstrated on this illustration and with unknown relevance to filler induced blindness is the anterior ethmoidal artery, which has a terminal cutaneous branch, the anterior nasal artery. This vessel enters the nasal dorsum between the nasal bone and upper lateral cartilage.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sjz312f0001"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>It is presumed that injectable filling agents may cause blindness if a column of filler is pushed against the prevailing arterial blood pressure of the ophthalmic artery and gains access to the central retinal arterial system and/or the ciliary vessels. An embolus is carried forward by the usual direction of flow on release of the plunger. The locations of greatest risk appear to be the forehead, glabella, and nasal dorsum. The nasolabial fold region is the area of next greatest risk.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sjz312f0002"/></fig><p>The degree of subsequent visual disturbance would relate to the nature of the filler: the volume injected, its cohesivity, particle size, and the vessels affected. Total obstruction of the ophthalmic artery would tend towards visual loss, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia, whereas isolated central retinal artery occlusion would tend towards visual loss alone. Branch retinal artery occlusion may cause a partial visual loss.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Combinations of these patterns can occur.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Some visual loss patterns would be more amenable to reversal than others, and hyaluronic acid would be the only injectable agent potentially reversible at all via intervention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15-17</xref></sup> The adverse event of stroke that may occur in about 25% of those with visual disturbances following fillers was also discussed by the group but was included in only one of the consensus statements on examination.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><sec id="s2"><title>Key Points</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A column of filler is probably required to induce embolic visual loss from hyaluronic acid injection</p></list-item><list-item><p>The degree of visual loss may relate to the volume injected, its cohesivity, particle size, and vessels affected</p></list-item><list-item><p>The exact embolized vessels within the orbital system will dictate the clinical pattern</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cerebral infarction may occur in 25% of patients with embolic visual loss</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s3"><title>METHODS</title><p>A consensus meeting was held on the September 23, 2018 in Melbourne, Australia and comprised a consensus group of 22 members from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, USA, and Taiwan.</p><p>A number of prepared questions, designed by the lead author (G.J.G.), were introduced to the consensus meeting.

The group felt that there is currently no evidence to support aspiration as a safety measure. Review of the literature and discussion among this group of experts illustrate that this is an unreliable and impractical technique. Numerous studies have shown a high false-negative rate with a positive aspiration in in vitro studies ranging from only 33% to at best 53% of attempts.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27-30</xref></sup> Aspiration results are profoundly influenced by needle diameter and length, the rheology of the filler being injected, whether the needle is empty or already contains filler in its lumen, syringe dimension, blood pressure, and, most importantly, degree of negative pressure and the time this pressure is maintained for. Evidence that filler material tracks distant from the needle tip to a more superficial plane further renders a negative aspiration result unhelpful.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>A negative aspiration (needle in vessel but no aspiration achieved) may also risk giving the injector a false sense of security to proceed with a risky injection, and a positive aspiration (blood on aspiration) will only be relevant for the instant the needle is in that position. After a false negative aspiration, an injector may be encouraged to proceed to inject through a needle tip that is being held steady but may be within a vessel. This could permit and encourage bolus injection of a cohesive column of embolic material to be delivered into the vascular system. Thus, we cannot recommend aspiration and in fact recommend against it.</p><p>This group believes that a safer technique is to inject product very slowly through a constantly moving needle even given that they may pass momentarily through vessels. If the injector combines slow injection and low extrusion pressure with this continuing movement then any intravascular product delivery should be minimal. This will in turn minimize the amount of material delivered into any potentially encountered vessel to less than the threshold required for any meaningful and problematic embolism.</p><p>It is likely that all filler injections pass through many blood vessels during product delivery in all areas of facial injection (as evidenced by bruising). In certain areas such as lips, practitioners will rarely resort to aspiration despite this region&#x02019;s vascularity. In these areas most professionals, whether aware of it or not, will utilize these principles of slow injection, low extrusion pressure, and movement together with an anatomical understanding instinctively without resorting to aspiration. The same principles should apply in all sites of facial injections.</p><p>To apply this safer technique of slow injecting through a moving needle to create a &#x0201c;bolus&#x0201d; (where the aspiration test is most often employed), minimal oscillating movements of the injecting hand will place multiple microboluses in the same area, cumulating in a bolus deposit of product in the desired plane while adhering to maximal safety in practice. We also suggest angling the needle (preferably with bevel down) because this may facilitate the ability to employ these minimal oscillating movements within the same plane.</p><p>Many of these recommendations are similar to those presented in a recent blindness review.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Additionally, the authors of this review suggested being especially cautious in those patients who previously underwent surgery and in application of digital pressure to occlude major periorbital vessels as additional exercises in safety. Notably, most of the cases of blindness between the authors&#x02019; 2 reviews in 2015 and 2018 involved the nasal region (56.3%), glabella (27.1%), and forehead (18.8%), equating to our grade 4 regions of highest risk (consensus point 3) and further substantiating our consensus point 8 above.

Because this complication may occur in a variety of settings and affect practitioners with a variety of skill levels, advice should be tailored to avoid issues of incorrect diagnosis and treatment by practitioners beyond their comfort level. It must be acknowledged that this issue is associated with extreme practitioner and patient anxiety, and therefore clear guidelines to follow would be helpful.</p><p>This group found unanimity of opinion in all but one of the issues raised for discussion. Specifically, terms of consent, techniques for safest injection technique, division of facial regions along lines of safety for teaching purposes, documentation and examination at the bedside of the event, hyaluronidase utilization at injection site (in the case of hyaluronic acid embolization), and anticoagulation (not to use) were agreed on. Only in the use of agents to decrease intraocular pressure was there an absence of consensus largely because the group felt there was a lack of data to support a position either way.</p><p>Limitations to this consensus document include the incomplete data and evidence-based reports that were accessible to the authors. Issues included the rarity of the event and the inability to access any prospective studies in vivo in humans given the nature of the condition. Limitations in studies also impacted the possible validity of some of our safety recommendations such as cannulae being safer in certain scenarios, utilizing local anesthetic before cannula use, the direction of the instrument, and injecting away from the eye. We had insufficient data on the utility of procedures to lower intraocular pressure in the event of embolic events. We also felt in the light of incomplete evidence surrounding the successful utilization of retrobulbar injection of hyaluronidase that we could not recommend this as treatment at the bedside except in those experienced with its utilization.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The major conclusions of this consensus are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The patient should be adequately consented for the possibility of visual impairment and cerebrovascular accident, and the patient should also agree to remedial measures in the event of these adverse events.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Safety measures should be employed in all patients including understanding the injection anatomy in any given area, injecting slowly with low extrusion pressure, understanding that cannulae are safer in some areas but not all areas, considering local anesthetic with epinephrine at cannula entrance points, directing the injection instrument across axial vessels, utilizing micro boluses (&#x0003c;0.1 mL), continually moving the instrument even in small amplitude movements in the chosen plane, and injecting in a direction away from the eye when possible.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is currently no evidence to support aspiration as a safety measure, and the consensus was against relying on this maneuver.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is possible to grade regions according to risk and the clinical environment in which these injections should be delivered. The forehead, nose, and glabella were considered the regions that should only be treated by those with extensive experience, comprehensive training, and up-to-date training in anatomy and safest practice and delivered in a medical clinic where help may be readily available.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If visual loss is suspected, this should be documented as should cutaneous and neurological involvement.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All clinics should be equipped with hyaluronidase and know how to utilize this for cutaneous involvement and attempt injection at the suspected injection point of filler as well as supratrochlear and/or supraorbital regions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Retrobulbar and peribulbar hyaluronidase should be attempted only by those experienced in this technique.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anticoagulation should not be performed at the bedside.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The consensus group could not agree on the effectiveness of maneuvers to decrease intraocular pressure and took no stance on these.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack id="a1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge Dr Levent Efe (Certified Medical Illustrator and Post-doctoral Fellow at the Johns Hopkins Medical School, Department of Art as Applied to Medicine) for the illustrations accompanying this paper.</p></ack><sec id="s0106"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Dr Goodman is a consultant for Allergan, Inc. and Galderma.
