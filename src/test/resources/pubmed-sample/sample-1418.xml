The study seeks to accurately measure sediment mobilization through the different parts of the model (surface, gully pots and pipe system), also obtaining a precise characterization of water flow and using realistic rainfall simulator to ensure the transferability of the results. Three different rain intensities and five sediment granulometries were tested in 6 hydraulic and 23 wash-off and sediment transport experiments. The following experimental data were produced: surface elevations and 2D runoff velocities measured by visualization techniques; surface and in-pipe water depths; flow discharges, total suspended solids concentrations and particle size distribution at the entrance of the gully pots and at the pipe system outlet; and sediment mass balances. This data is optimal for developing and validating wash-off and sediment transport formulations in urban drainage models, towards better treatment and management techniques for minimizing the impact of urban surface pollutants on the environments of towns and cities.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="summary"><p id="Par2">

These pollutants are washed off in rain events and transported by stormwater runoff into drainage systems and eventually into aquatic media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, representing one of the most significant environmental issues in urban areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In this context, concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) are typically used as indicators in the study of the transport of fine particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which have been found to be closely related to many pollutants, such as heavy metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. TSS wash-off and transport modelling is thus an important tool for the development of management and treatment techniques to minimize the environmental impact of these contaminants.</p><p id="Par5">Several empirical equations and models have commonly been used in the literature to model urban wash-off<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, the prediction accuracy of these lumped formulations is still quite limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This due to (i) difficulties in accurately measuring input variables such as the initial sediment load and characteristics, and (ii) the fact that they do not consider spatial and sediment heterogeneities. Recently, physically-based wash-off models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> have appeared as alternatives to empirical equations as a means of considering spatial heterogeneities, and to model main wash-off processes such as the detachment of particles by raindrop impacts or runoff shear, particle transport and deposition. However, this leads to an increase in the input variables needed to accurately determine and make a precise representation of the surface flow needed. Gully pot modelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and sewer transport modelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, as well as interactions between surface and drainage systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, are also key in order to provide an integrated solution to runoff TSS mobilization.</p><p id="Par6">Due to the variability and randomness of the sediment build-up process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, field data uncertainties in the measurement of sediment input variables can be propagated through models and lead to unreliable results. In addition, variability and heterogeneity of rainfall and detailed geometries of urban catchments include additional uncertainties in wash-off modelling, which can lead to the incorrect evaluation of equations and models. In this regard, some authors have performed experimental studies over impervious surfaces where initial conditions are accurately determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> in order to assess new wash-off formulations. However, the surfaces considered in these physical models are no larger than 1&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>, and such models do not consider gully pots interactions or typical curb flows, so their application is limited to first approximations in simple urban catchments.</p><p id="Par7">In light of this, the current dataset provides a series of experiments in which variables involving sediment wash-off by rainfall and transport through gully pots and pipes were accurately measured under laboratory-controlled conditions. The experiments were performed in a full-scale street section physical model, including a 36&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> rainfall simulator and two gully pots that drain runoff into a drainage pipe system. First, an accurate hydraulic characterization was performed, measuring flows and depths generated by three different rain intensities, additionally obtaining runoff velocity distributions and elevations using visualization techniques. In Naves <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, these data have been used to assess Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) and Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques to accurately represent overland flow obtaining surface velocity distributions and surface elevations respectively. The videos and images provided can be of reuse as a means of optimizing visualization techniques for hydraulic modelling purposes.</p><p id="Par8">Then, in a total of 23 experiments, concentrations of TSS and particle size distributions at the entrance of gully pots and at the pipe system outlet were monitored to assess wash-off and sediment transport processes from accurately measured sediment initial conditions, using the three different rainfall intensities and five sediment classes with different granulometries. The dataset is unique in that it is obtained on a 1:1 scale with realistic and very accurately measured initial conditions, and as such will allow other researchers to test models and hypotheses, thus improving our overall knowledge of urban wash-off and sediment transport. The precisely measured input variables and the TSS concentrations at gully pots have already been used in Naves <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> to perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a recently developed physically-based wash-off model without considering uncertainties in input variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical model description</title><p id="Par9">The laboratory facility (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) was built in the Hydraulic Laboratory of the Centre of Technological Innovation in Construction and Civil Engineering (CITEEC) at the University of A Coru&#x000f1;a (Spain), and consists of a rainfall simulator over a 36&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> full-scale concrete street section. Two gully pots and a lateral outflow channel drain the runoff generated by rainfall into a pipe network that transports runoff to a common outlet. The rainfall simulator consists of 2,500 pressure-compensating irrigation drippers (PCJ-CNL, Netafim<sup>TM</sup>) disposed in a grid layout and inserted in two overlapped circuits of pipes, which are placed 2.6&#x02009;m above the physical model surface. Drippers inserted in each circuit generate 1.2 and 2&#x02009;L/h, respectively. Thus, given a distribution of 25 drippers per square meter in each circuit, the rainfall simulator is able to generate rainfall with a rain intensity of 30 or 50&#x02009;mm/h. Both circuits can also be used at the same time generating a rain intensity of 80&#x02009;mm/h. In addition, a metallic welded mesh with 3&#x02009;mm square openings, located 0.6&#x02009;m below the drippers, breaks and distributes drops to achieve realistic rainfall in terms of uniformity and raindrop size distribution. Rain intensity maps were measured for each rainfall from the volume collected in a 0.5&#x02009;m x 0.5&#x02009;m grid of vessels for 5&#x02009;minutes, and are available in Naves <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

Two elevation maps with different resolutions are provided, making it possible to implement the geometry in numerical models and to simulate runoff properly. First, a traditional topographic survey was carried out by measuring punctual distances from the surface to a reference laser plane with an accuracy of 0.5&#x02009;mm and a resolution of 0.5&#x02009;m x 0.5&#x02009;m. In addition, the Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric technique was used to obtain a 5&#x02009;mm resolution elevation map. This technique provides a 3D reconstruction from the triangulation of different points that appear in several images of the analyzed objects. 64 raw images, the point cloud resulting from the SfM software, and the methodology and reference points used to obtain the final elevation map, are all available in Naves <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and can be used to assess, analyze and reproduce the implementation of this technique to hydraulic physical models.</p><p id="Par11">The generated rainfall runoff drains into the pipe system through two gully pots located along the curb and a lateral outflow channel.

Online measurements of surface and in-pipe depths and gully pots and pipe system outlet discharges were registered from the beginning of the rain until 5&#x02009;minutes after the rain stopped. The measurement of discharge from gully pots requires closing their connection with the pipe system and deriving the gully pot inflow towards the underground deposit. This configuration prevented us from measuring total drained flow at the pipe system outlet, since the water that reached the outlet came uniquely from the outflow channel. Therefore, experiments for each rainfall were repeated with and without the connection between gully pots and the pipe system, in order to obtain discharges in the outlet and in both gully pots, respectively.

These experiments started by spreading particles over the model surface. Cameras began recording and ambient lights were turned off. Then, UV torches were turned on and a steady and uniform rainfall was generated. As the particles were washed-off by surface flow, it was necessary to add more particles on the roadway side during video recording. Steady runoff conditions were reached after approximately 150&#x02009;seconds. For videos without particles, the same methodology was followed, but replacing the UV torches with conventional LED lamps.

For this, TSS and Particle Size Distribution (PSD) samples at the entrance of the gully pots and at the pipe system outlet were collected for the three rain intensities and for five sediment classes, which have different granulometries, disposed realistically over the model surface. In addition, online turbidity records were registered at the pipe system outlet, and pipe depths and outlet discharge were measured. At the end of each experiment, a mass balance was performed in order to assess the final distribution of sediment in the different parts of the physical model and to confirm the reliability of the experiments.

During the simulated event, manual grab samples in the three measurement points were collected and turbidity, pipe depths, and outlet discharge were registered up to 5&#x02009;minutes after the rain stopped. Grab manual TSS and PSD samples at the entrance of the gully pots can interfere in the mass balance and in the TSS and PSD results at the pipe system outlet. Therefore, each experiment was repeated without manual samples at the gully pots, this to ensure reliability in pipe system outlet samples and final mass balances. However, some experiments with low rain intensity and larger sediment grain sizes were performed only once, since most of the sediment remained on surface or was deposited in gully pots, presenting negligible TSS concentrations at the pipe system outlet.

Prior to the experiments, sensors were pre-calibrated in order to convert the registered voltages to depths and discharges. To do this, signal-distance linear calibrations, with a determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) above 0.99, were obtained measuring five known distances from sensors to a reference plane. After this, the raw time series registered in the experiments were processed in the following way. First, a five seconds wide median filter was implemented to remove peak signals higher than twice the standard deviation. Then, a 20&#x02009;seconds wide moving median was applied to smooth the signal. Finally, the pre-calibration was used to transform signals into distances and obtain depth results from the differences between the measurements during the experiment and the dry surface reference, which was measured for 60&#x02009;seconds before the rain began.

The signal processing starts by removing peaks higher than twice the standard deviation with a five seconds-wide median filter. Then, a five seconds-wide moving median was applied to the signal before obtaining flow time series using pre-calibration polynomial regression. However, these results corresponded to the deposit outflow, so it was necessary to consider the volume that was retained when the flow, and thus the water level in the deposits, varied. Signal-depth calibrations, as performed for surface and pipe depths, plus the area of the deposits, were thus used to consider these variations of volume in time steps of 5&#x02009;seconds, obtaining the water flow at the entrance of the deposits.

Frames were obtained from 4 k and 25 fps videos recorded by two Lumix GH4 cameras (focal length 28&#x02009;mm), which were installed above the sidewalk of the physical model, covering the first two meters of roadway from the curb. Two different tracers were used in the experiments applying LSPIV: i) fluorescent particles illuminated by UV torches, and ii) water reflections and small bubbles generated by raindrop impacts. The analysis of the runoff velocities in steady conditions started by extracting 1,500 frames (60&#x02009;s) from each camera recording. First, a spatial calibration was required to rectify the angle of the cameras and the lens distortion, and to join the images from each camera. Matlab algorithm &#x02018;fitgeotrans&#x02019; was applied, identifying in each video reference points drawn in the model surface in order to transform video frames to an orthogonal reference system.

In addition, not only are the initial sediment conditions completely defined, but the hydraulic behavior of the experiments is also accurately determined, including depth and velocity measurements of very shallow flows. Finally, surface wash-off and in-pipe sediment transport is precisely measured by TSS and PSD samples and by analyzing the mobilization of sediments through performing mass balances at the end of the tests. The dataset introduced in this study, then, is useful in the following ways:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par38">Hydraulic and wash-off dual drainage modelling studies in urban catchments. Data can be used to develop, calibrate and validate urban drainage models, including wash-off and sediment transport processes in the different components of the drainage system (surface, gully pots, in-pipe) without considering uncertainties in the input variables. The use of different sediment classes also means that the analysis of single and multi-class sediment transport modelling is itself of interest. Finally, the data herein lead to our research being replicable, and thus allows other researchers to test their own models and hypotheses.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39">Assessment and optimization of seeded and unseeded LSPIV techniques. The raw videos and data provided are of great use as a means of improving the understanding of the use of LSPIV analysis in urban environments, with very shallow flows and in the presence of raindrops.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Study of the novel application of photogrammetric techniques for hydraulic modelling purposes. The raw images and raw point cloud results can be used to assess photogrammetric techniques in order for these to be used in further field and physical model applications.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The first author was in receipt of a Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities predoctoral grant [FPU14/01778].
