The comparison of 10 cold-sensitive descendant lines with 10 cold-tolerant descendant lines identified 140 proteins that showed decreased protein abundance, such as the components of the photosynthesis apparatus and cell-wall metabolism. The identified proteins were classified into the following main groups: protein metabolism, stress/defense, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, sulfur metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, RNA metabolism, energy production, cell-wall metabolism, membrane and transportation, and signal transduction. Results of quantitative real-time PCR of 20 differentially accumulated proteins indicated that the transcriptional expression patterns of 10 genes were consistent with their protein expression models. Virus-induced gene silencing of Hsp90, BBI, and REP14 genes indicated that virus-silenced plants subjected to cold stress had more severe drooping and wilting, an increased rate of relative electrolyte leakage, and reduced relative water content compared to viral control plants. Furthermore, ultrastructural changes of virus-silenced plants were destroyed more severely than those of viral control plants. These results indicate that Hsp90, BBI, and REP14 potentially play vital roles in conferring cold tolerance in bread wheat.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cold stress is one of the major abiotic stresses, as it adversely affects the growth and development of plants and significantly constrains the spatial distribution of plants and agricultural productivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Cold stress prevents the expression of the full genetic potential of plants via direct inhibition of metabolic reactions and indirect cold-induced osmotic (chilling-induced inhibition of water uptake and freezing-induced cellular dehydration), and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Plants adopt several strategies to cope with this adverse condition, such as raising the level of chaperones and antioxidants, producing more energy by activation of primary metabolisms, and maintaining osmotic balance by altering membrane structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Many overwintering plants, including important crop species such as wheat, rye, and barley, are capable of adapting to low (but not freezing) temperatures (LT) via precise reprogramming of gene expression, e.g., transcription factors, chaperones, metabolic enzymes, late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins, dehydrins, and antioxidative enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This process of acquiring freezing tolerance is known as cold acclimation (CA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Overwintering plants acquire freezing tolerance and are capable of surviving under persistent freezing conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Acclimation to cold stress is mediated via intense changes in gene expression that translate into alterations in the compositions of the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Due to the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the expression profiles of accumulated proteins are often poorly correlated with their corresponding mRNAs, e.g., in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Considering the facts that proteins are the direct agents of plant stress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the investigation of dynamic changes in plant proteomes is of great importance.</p><p id="Par3">In recent years, the conventional 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by mass spectrometry (MS) have been widely used to identify proteome alterations related to chilling and freezing stress in different kinds of plants including barley, soybean, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, rice, wheat, and tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, traditional 2-DE approaches show low identification rates for proteins, inaccurate quantification of different proteins, poor reproducibility, and the difficulty in separating hydrophobic restive factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is a recently developed and powerful technique that can identify a higher number of proteins and provide more reliable quantitative information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This method has been used to identify abiotic stress responsive-proteins in wheat. Via iTRAQ, the first shotgun wheat proteomics study was conducted to investigate the protein responses to drought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. A new metabolic pathway in wheat seedling growth under hydrogen peroxide stress was revealed via iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Proteomic analysis was performed using iTRAQ to study the drought adaptability of roots in 2 wheat cultivars with ABA differential response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Hg-responsive proteins were identified in wheat seedlings using iTRAQ analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, no proteomic iTRAQ analysis of the response of common wheat to cold stress has been reported.</p><p id="Par4">Winter wheat is one of the most important crops in most wheat regions of the world. In these areas, frost injury during winter could be particularly destructive. However, limited success has been achieved in developing freezing tolerant cultivars by wheat breeders across the world. Besides the unpredictable nature of frost injury under field conditions, this difficulty may be partly due to the participation of different genes in cold tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms of wheat response to cold stress is crucial for breeding new frost-resistant cultivars and decreasing the risk of crop failure in cold areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, it is important to identify cold-responsive proteins with potential uses in crop improvement and breeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In our previous study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) winter wheat population was utilized to reveal cold-responsive proteins based on 2-DE, and a total of 20 cold-responsive protein candidates were successfully identified. Furthermore, the PAP6-like protein gene was functionally verified to be related to cold response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, cold response is controlled by polygenes and phenotypic separation of cold response in this RIL population (not 3:1) suggests that there are multiple genes controlling cold response. Therefore, iTRAQ, which possesses higher flux and wider detection range than 2-DE, was performed to uncover additional cold-responsive proteins in this RIL wheat population. In total, 223 proteins were identified with significantly altered abundance. Furthermore, preliminary functional analysis based on virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was conducted on 3 new candidate cold-responsive proteins. A better understanding of the cold-tolerance mechanisms in bread wheat via proteomic discovery of these candidate proteins could produce a wide range of benefits in wheat breeding program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par5">An overview of the experimental procedures utilized in this study for quantitative proteome analysis is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The wheat parental cultivars UC 1110 (Rank 3) and PI 610750 (Rank 0) differed in cold-tolerance, therefore, the descendants displayed segregation of cold tolerance.

In total, there were 223 differentially accumulated proteins identified by iTRAQ. For instance, there were 51 metabolism-related proteins, 41 stress/defense-related proteins, 38 photosynthesis-related proteins, 15 carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins, and 4 energy production-related proteins identified by iTRAQ (Additional Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

The up-regulated expression of CRT3 (W5CEZ6) in CSP compared with CTP implies that this calreticulin is also involved in the wheat response to cold stress.</p><p id="Par29">The primary metabolisms, such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and energy metabolisms, need to be modulated in response to cold stress. Our results show that 15 carbohydrate metabolic enzymes exhibited changes in abundance in CSP compared with CTP (Additional Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Within this group, the levels of most of the proteins related to glycolysis (5 of 7, 71.4%) increased. For example, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (O22387), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase chloroplastic-like (J3LJK2), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (M0XEC5). Their up-regulation might help to produce more energy needed in cold defense processes. In comparison, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating-like isoform 1 (I1H2R0) and putative 6-phosphogluconolactonase 4, and chloroplastic (W5FQX8) involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were down-regulated. Two Ferredoxin-nitrite reductases (NiR) (M0W559 and W5GWJ4) related to nitrogen metabolism were also up-regulated by cold stress. NiR catalyzes the reduction of nitrite to ammonium in the second step of the nitrate-assimilation pathway. NiR changes in etiolated rice seedlings were induced by nitrate and light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Two sulfur metabolism-related enzymes, putative plastidic cysteine synthase (W5FLB0) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1 (A0A096UUP6), were up-regulated by cold stress. Cysteine synthase (CS) catalyzes the final reaction in the cysteine biosynthetic pathway. This reaction is also a key limiting step in the production of glutathione, a thiol implicated in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. A significant accumulation of CS under cold stress has been reported in rice, <italic>Lolium perenne</italic>, and wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. S-adenosylmethionine synthetase catalyzes the biosynthesis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, a precursor for the biosynthesis of polyamines and ethylene. A close correlation between cold tolerance and polyamine accumulation level in rice under cold stress has been reported. The up-regulated expression of ATP synthase beta subunit (A9L9Z4), ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit (A0A0F6NQY1), and ATP synthase subunit a (chloroplast) (A0A0E0EPX3) revealed that energy metabolism was altered under cold stress. ATP synthases are membrane-bound enzyme complexes/ion transporters that connect ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis with the transport of protons across a membrane. These enzymes play critical roles in the removal of damaged proteins and in the control of some key cellular components, combining peptidase and chaperone activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Overexpression of the ATP synthase gene in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> caused an increased resistance to salt, drought, and cold stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. The up-regulation of carbohydrate catabolism, nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism, and energy pathway-related proteins in CSP may contribute to stabilizing the cellular osmotic pressure. The up-regulation was a result of the increased energy demand in plants exposed to cold stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Cold stress enhances protein degradation</title><p id="Par30">Proteomic analysis showed that several proteins were partially degraded by cold stress, especially the components of the photosynthesis apparatus, cell-wall metabolism, membrane and transportation, and lipid metabolism (Additional Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Similarly, the results from a diploid wild wheat proteome under cold stress showed that several proteins were down-regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These results indicated that LT enhanced protein degradation. Photosynthesis is thought to be one of the first processes influenced by cold stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. One typical example of a photosynthesis molecule is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), of which 9 subunits or subunit fragments were identified in this study. Most of these (6, representing 66.7%) were down-regulated. The degradation of Rubisco has also been reported in cold stressed rice and wheat proteomic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Moreover, our results also provide evidence for the degradation of other photosynthetic proteins such as the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II subunit (A3BKU8), carbonic anhydrase (F2DZH9 and B4F9E2), chlorophyll a-b binding protein, chloroplastic (M0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0F4 and M0ZEV8), chlorophyll a-b binding protein 1B, and chloroplastic (M8CA60). These results suggest that the photosynthesis apparatus is susceptible to cold stress. This may be one of the major reasons for decreased net photosynthetic rate under cold stress conditions. Another typical example of cell-wall metabolism is fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs), which are a subclass of cell wall glycoprotein family-arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein 11-like (M8BBJ1) and fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein 7-like (A0A0A9EJ37) were identified in our study. Indeed, FLAs are implicated in cell wall biosynthesis, cell wall remodeling, and signaling. FLAs have also been reported in the response to salt stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our results provide the first evidence for the degradation of these 2 FLAs by cold stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Wheat silenced for the 3 candidate protein genes under cold stress using VIGS</title><p id="Par31">Hsp90s are ubiquitous molecular chaperones in the cells of eukaryotes and eubacteria. They play key roles in signal transduction, protein folding, protein degradation, growth and developmental programs, and responses to environmental stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown growth inhibition and abnormalities in T-DNA knockout lines lacking any of the 4 cytosolic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> AtHsp90 genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. The silencing of cytosolic Hsp90 expression in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and soybean resulted in stunted and deformed leaf phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. In our study, the identified Hsp90 shared 99% identity with TaHsp90.2. Moreover, it has been verified that the suppression of the TaHsp90.2 gene via VIGS compromised the hypersensitive resistance response of the wheat variety to stripe rust fungus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Our study confirmed the role of Hsp90 in the response to cold stress in wheat. Protease inhibitors respond to a number of cellular physiological processes by regulating protease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. BBI-type protease inhibitors are common in both developing seeds and wounded plant tissue. In addition to its well-studied role in defense against pathogenesis, it may also be involved in abiotic stress response. For instance, Shitan <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup> showed that BBI was responsible for tolerance to excess cadmium in yeast. Three wheat WIP1-like genes (wali3, wali5, and wali6) were induced by wounding or by the imposition of aluminum ions or toxic metal stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. WRSI5 is induced by salt stress, drought, Al<sup>3+</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress. Furthermore, the overexpression of WRSI5 improved the salt tolerance of <italic>A. Thaliana</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. In our study, one BBI was successfully identified, which is induced by cold stress. Furthermore, our results represent the first verification of the role of this gene in wheat cold tolerance. Cold acclimation is triggered by the exposure of plants to low but nonfreezing temperatures for certain periods of time. During this process, plants exhibit dramatic alterations in their gene expression profiles. These changes include the induction of an array of cold-responsive (Cor) genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Wheat and barley possess a small family of Cor genes including Wcs19, Wcor14, and Bcor14b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>, all of which encode chloroplast-targeted COR proteins analogous to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein COR15a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>. The wheat Cor gene Wcor15 was isolated in 2003, and it encodes a chloroplast-targeted protein and shares LT specificity with the barley and wheat Cor genes. The expression of Wcor15 was specifically induced by LT in wheat leaves, and light illumination markedly increases the steady-state level of its transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Furthermore, transgenic lines expressing the Wcor15-GFP fusion gene showed a significantly improved level of freezing tolerance compared with wild-type tobacco plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. In our study, REP14 has a 95% identity with Wcor15, and the abundance of this protein was increased in CTP compared with CSP after over-wintering. The qRT-PCR results showed that REP14 was also induced under cold stress and the role of this gene in wheat cold tolerance needs to be further studied.</p><p id="Par32">VIGS was successfully used in monocotyledonous barley using BSMV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>. Indeed, the development of VIGS for functional genomics in monocots is significant because of the difficulty in applying other loss-of-function approaches requiring transformation to these species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Since this technology was first successfully used in bread wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, VIGS has been widely used for analysis of gene function for resistance of wheat pathogen and wheat aphid as well as water stress response genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>. Moreover, we successfully applied VIGS on the functional analysis of cold-responsive genes in wheat. In this study, VIGS was also carried out for the functional validation of three candidate cold-responsive genes Hsp90, BBI, and REP14. Additionally, stress is associated with structural cell damage and reduced moisture content in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>; these changes may lead to plant lodging or leaves wilting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>. In this study, leaves of the freeze-stressed BSMV<sub>Hsp90</sub>, BSMV<sub>BBI</sub>, and BSMV<sub>REP14</sub>-treated plants showed distinctly more severe droop and wilt than the freeze-stressed viral controls. This phenotypic result was confirmed by markedly increased rates of relative electrolyte leakage but decreased RWC in the freeze-stressed BSMV<sub>HSP90</sub>, BSMV<sub>BBI</sub>, and BSMV<sub>REP14</sub>-treated plants, these results indicate important roles of Hsp90, BBI, and REP14 in confering water and low-temeprature stress in wheat.</p><p id="Par33">Until recently, TEM images of thin sections of BSMV-infected leaves were only examined in epidermal cells of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and barley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref></sup>. This is the first time we have conducted TEM for the leaves of BSMV-infected wheat. Chloroplasts are the first and most severely impacted organelle under cold injury. It is typical that plasma membranes invaginate (plasmolyse), the shape and size of the chloroplasts change, thylakoids become swollen and distorted, and numerous plastoglobules accumulate under cold stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref></sup>. This study was consistent with these results, and the ultrastructural morphological injuries were apparent in wheat leaves under freezing stress, especially in gene silenced plants. It was found that freeze-stressed BSMV<sub>0</sub>-treated plants suffered less serious injuries in mesophyll cells than freeze-stressed BSMV<sub>BBI</sub>-treated plants. Furthermore, freeze-stressed BSMV<sub>0</sub>-treated plants exhibited better-developed granal stacks and less invagination of plasma membrane than freeze-stressed BSMV<sub>BBI</sub>-treated plants. For instance, chloroplast disintegration was observed in freeze-stressed BSMV<sub>BBI</sub>-treated plants but not in BSMV<sub>0</sub>-treated plants. In addition, TEM images of abnormally rounded chloroplasts, cytoplasmic inclusions, and their association with virus-like particles obtained by using the BSMV are similar to images of thin sections of BSMV-infected <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and barley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref></sup>. The difference is that there were fewer chloroplasts which contained membrane-bound cytoplasmic inclusions (virus-like particles) in wheat than in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and barley. The reasons contributing to the differences could possibly owing to virus-infected period and duration, experimental materials, and treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
