We showed recently that mucin, the main protein in the mucus layer, is disrupted during early periods of intestinal ischemia. This event is accompanied by entry of pancreatic digestive enzymes into the intestinal wall. We hypothesize that the mucin-containing mucus layer is the main barrier preventing digestive enzymes from contacting the epithelium. Mucin breakdown may render the epithelium accessible to pancreatic enzymes, causing its disruption and increased permeability. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of mucin as a protection for epithelial integrity and function. A rat model of 30 min splanchnic arterial occlusion (SAO) was used to study the degradation of two mucin isoforms (mucin 2 and 13) and two epithelial membrane proteins (E-cadherin and toll-like receptor 4, TLR4). In addition, the role of digestive enzymes in mucin breakdown was assessed in this model by luminal inhibition with acarbose, tranexamic acid, or nafamostat mesilate. Furthermore, the protective effect of the mucin layer against trypsin-mediated disruption of the intestinal epithelium was studied in vitro. Rats after SAO showed degradation of mucin 2 and fragmentation of mucin 13, which was not prevented by protease inhibition. Mucin breakdown was accompanied by increased intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran as well as degradation of E-cadherin and TLR4. Addition of mucin to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro protected against trypsin-mediated degradation of E-cadherin and TLR4 and reduced permeability of FITC-dextran across the monolayer. These results indicate that mucin plays an important role in the preservation of the mucosal barrier and that ischemia but not digestive enzymes disturbs mucin integrity, while digestive enzymes actively mediate epithelial cell disruption.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intestinal epithelium covering the gastrointestinal tract consists of a monolayer of enterocytes covered by a mucus gel layer.

The major protein component of the mucus layer is mucin, which consists of several isoforms, both secreted and membrane associated. Mucin is believed to protect the epithelial surface of the small intestine from luminal digestive enzymes, abrasion by food particles, and pathogens by forming a barrier between the lumen and the intestinal epithelium <xref rid="pone.0040087-Gum1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Strous1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Lamont1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The epithelial cells also form a selective barrier to molecules found in the lumen; this barrier depends on the integrity of intercellular junctions and the extracellular plasma membrane proteins. Changes in the environment of epithelial cells make these molecules targets for proteolytic attack <xref rid="pone.0040087-Werb1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, cause disruption of cell structure components influencing intracellular signaling <xref rid="pone.0040087-Coughlin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Giannelli1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and impair epithelial barrier function <xref rid="pone.0040087-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Intestinal epithelial cells express numerous membrane proteins on the plasma membrane whose fate after disruption of the mucin layer is uncertain. We have reported that E-cadherin, which plays a major role in maintaining the intercellular junctions between epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0040087-Man1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> is degraded during intestinal ischemia <xref rid="pone.0040087-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Conversely the fate of other membrane molecules, e.g. toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is usually associated with infection and sepsis <xref rid="pone.0040087-Hotchkiss1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Lorenz1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and recently has been linked to hemorrhagic shock and intestinal ischemia <xref rid="pone.0040087-Sodhi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Moses1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, remains unknown. Since during ischemia disruption of mucin 2 (secreted) and mucin 13 (membrane bound) is accompanied by transport of digestive enzymes into the intestinal wall, we hypothesized that mucin is a barrier to luminal digestive enzymes under normal physiological conditions, as contact by digestive enzymes with the epithelium due to the absence or degradation of mucin results in receptor destruction and loss of epithelial cell integrity and function.</p><p>In this study we studied whether mucin disruption observed during intestinal ischemia is accompanied by impaired epithelial cell integrity and function. Using a rat model of intestinal ischemia by splanchnic arterial occlusion (SAO) we studied the fate of two mucin isoforms (mucin 2 and mucin 13) and two selected membrane proteins (E-cadherin and TLR4), as well as mucin 2 mRNA levels during and after the ischemic period. We also examined the effect of digestive enzymes on mucin and epithelial cell disruption by luminal amylase inhibition with acarbose and serine protease inhibition with tranexamic acid and nafamostat mesilate. Furthermore, we utilized rat intestinal epithelial cell cultures to demonstrate that addition of a mucin layer on the apical side protects epithelial cells against trypsin-mediated disruption.</p><fig id="pone-0040087-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0040087.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Inhibitory profile of acarbose and nafamostat mesilate.</title><p>Lineweaver-Burk Plot with inset Michaelis-Menten plot of amylase activity with different concentrations of acarbose (<bold>A</bold>) and trypsin activity with different concentrations of nafamostat mesilate (<bold>B</bold>).

</title><p>In order to determine if trypsin disrupts the epithelial cells in a like manner to that observed in vivo in the rat model of intestinal ischemia and whether addition of a mucin layer prevents this, we studied an in vitro model using a monolayer of rat intestinal epithelial cells. After incubation of IEC-18 cells for 1 hour with 5 &#x000b5;M trypsin, E-cadherin immunohistochemical labeling was decreased without alteration in cell shape or the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040087-g008">Figure 8</xref>). At higher trypsin concentrations, the epithelial actin cytoskeleton started to disappear, the cells retracted and the monolayer began to disintegrate. Western blot for both intra- and extra-cellular domains of E-cadherin revealed degradation of this protein in whole-cell lysates after one hour incubation with serum free media containing 5 &#x000b5;M trypsin (SFM&#x0002b;Try) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040087-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This is supported by reduced density of the whole molecule as seen with antibodies against both intra- and extra-cellular domains as well as the appearance of lower molecular weight bands. Application of a layer of 10&#x00025; mucin on the apical side of the cells prior to the addition of the serum free media with trypsin resulted in higher density of the whole molecule of both intra- and extra-cellular domains of E-cadherin and decreased density of their corresponding lower molecular weight bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040087-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Similarly, density levels for the extracellular domain of TLR4 were reduced in intestinal epithelial cells that were treated with serum free media containing trypsin (SFM&#x0002b;Try) as compared to those without trypsin treatment (SFM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040087-g010">Figure 10</xref>).

In both cases we observed loss of E-cadherin, increased permeability to FITC-dextran, and degradation of TLR4. Trypsin concentration in the rat intestinal lumen has been reported to be between 1 to 40 &#x000b5;M <xref rid="pone.0040087-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Miyasaka1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>; the typical trypsin concentration used to pass cells in cell culture is 0.5 g/L (22 &#x000b5;M) <xref rid="pone.0040087-Helgason1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In the present studies, we show that incubation of intestinal epithelial cells with 5 &#x000b5;M trypsin for one hour is sufficient to degrade E-cadherin and TLR4 without destroying the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040087-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We demonstrated in vivo that sham animals have an intact mucin layer with preserved epithelial cell integrity and function; similarly we showed in vitro that having a mucin layer on the apical side of the cell monolayer protects the intestinal epithelial cells against trypsin-mediated disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040087-g009">Figures 9</xref> and10). Collectively these results suggest that if digestive enzymes such as trypsin are given the opportunity to come in contact with enterocytes at concentrations normally found in the intestinal lumen the result will be loss of integrity and function of the epithelial barrier.</p><p>An intact mucin layer in normal intestine is then important to protect epithelial membrane proteins against enzymatic attack; for instance, degradation of E-cadherin junctions results in increased epithelial permeability. Degradation of membrane receptors, such as TLR4, disrupts the usual pathway for TLR4 signaling after binding of lipopolysaccharides after as little as 30 min of ischemia. It remains to be investigated whether degradation of the extracellular domain of TLR4 may in itself initiate a signaling cascade, as has been reported for TLR5 and TLR15 <xref rid="pone.0040087-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-deZoete1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we also showed in vivo that mucin disruption during early periods of intestinal ischemia is not directly mediated by trypsin. Mucin 2 and mucin 13 are degraded during ischemia but this disruption is not prevented by the inhibition of trypsin with tranexamic acid or nafamostat mesilate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040087-g005">Figure 5</xref>). There is some preservation of mucin 2 and mucin13 by amylase inhibition with acarbose, which may suggest an indirect role of pancreatic amylase; the role of amylase remains to be further investigated. Furthermore the ischemic groups treated with luminal injection of enzyme inhibitors had reduced enzymatic activity and these groups had less visible injury as compared to the ischemic group without inhibitors. These results suggest that individual digestive enzymes or a combination of them mediate epithelial cell disruption but not mucin disruption.</p><p>Goblet cell-derived mucin (mucin 2) in the mucus layer has been proposed to be the major barrier against passage of high-molecular weight compounds across the intestinal barrier <xref rid="pone.0040087-Nimmerfall1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The level of the mucus layer is determined by a balance between secretion and degradation of this protein. A variety of stimuli in different pathologies may lead to mucin over-secretion or cessation of secretion <xref rid="pone.0040087-Kemper1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Forstner1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-LaMont1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Faure1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Merlin1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In the current results we show that after 30 min ischemia the level of MUC2 mRNA is significantly increased as compared to the sham group. This rapid response after a relatively short period of ischemia may serve to replenish mucin 2 in the mucus layer, which may be a critical protection mechanism to prevent the escape of luminal digestive enzymes. Further studies are necessary to determine whether MUC2 mRNA is translated if longer periods of ischemia and reperfusion are present and if under these conditions the rate of mucin degradation is greater than the rate of secretion, resulting in irreversible injury.</p><p>While the importance of the epithelial barrier in intestinal homeostasis is well recognized, the significance of the mucus layer with regard to passage of digestive enzymes remains less certain. We show here <italic>in vitro</italic> that addition of an exogenous layer of mucin to the apical side of intestinal epithelial cells significantly reduces trypsin-mediated disruption of E-cadherin and TLR4 but does not completely prevent it. One explanation could be that the exogenous mucin as used in the current experiment is of gastric origin, which contains MUC5 instead of MUC2. Although from different origins these two mucin isoforms have similar general characteristics <xref rid="pone.0040087-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Gendler1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition, it may be that complete protection against trypsin degradation by an exogenous mucin layer on an epithelial monolayer is not achieved because the mucin used in this experiment is partially purified and may not form a complete barrier as it is found <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In this study we investigate how two different mucin isoforms found in the small intestine (mucin2 and mucin13) are disrupted after splanchnic ischemia. However we cannot rule out the possible role of other mucin isoforms that although present in soluble form do not comprise a major part of the mucosal barrier; for instance mucin4, which is localized in the paneth cells but not in goblet cells of the small intestine <xref rid="pone.0040087-Rong1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> or mucin1 or mucin3 different types of membrane bound mucin. Functional studies to determine the role of mucin2 or mucin13 during intestinal ischemic injury present some challenges. Up to date only a knockout mice model for mucin2 gene (MUC2) is available. This model was first described in 2002 <xref rid="pone.0040087-Velcich1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and since then the effect of mucin2 deficiency has been largely characterized for the large intestine but less is known in this regard about the small intestine. The MUC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have significantly lower weight at 5 weeks after weaning (12 g as compared to 20 g for their wild type litter mates) <xref rid="pone.0040087-VanderSluis1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. MUC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also develop colitis as early as 5 weeks manifest in form of diarrhea, gross bleeding and lethargic state <xref rid="pone.0040087-Velcich1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-VanderSluis1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. MUC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have goblet cells with abnormal morphology, decreased epithelial barrier function, and altered expression in tight junction-related genes such as upregulation of claudin-10 and downregulation of claudin1 and claudin 5 <xref rid="pone.0040087-Velcich1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040087-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In addition there is upregulation of genes stimulating cell growth which manifests in intestinal tumor formation with spontaneous progression to invasive carcinoma later in life <xref rid="pone.0040087-Velcich1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Due to the fact that MUC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice do not have normal intestinal function after weaning which is usually the time used in experimental studies, MUC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are not appropriate to study the breakdown of the mucosal epithelial barrier because the barrier is already altered in this model.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here confirm that mucin in the mucus layer is a barrier that protects the intestinal epithelium against enzymatic auto-digestion. During ischemia mucin isoforms are degraded, which may stimulate synthesis of new mucin to restore the damaged barrier. As mucin is degraded and the barrier function of the mucus layer is thus compromised, digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine are allowed to come into contact with the epithelium with consequent loss of epithelial cell integrity and function. This cascade of events results in intestinal injury, transport of digestive enzymes into the systemic circulation and subsequent shock.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors want to thank Miranda Patton for her help with the qPCR experiments.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>Dr. Schmid-Sch&#x000f6;nbein is scientific consultant to Leading Ventures, San Diego, California, United States of America.
