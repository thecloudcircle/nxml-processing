Thus, mutant pathogens provide a useful tool for dissecting host-pathogen relationships, as the strategies the microbe has evolved to counteract immunity reveal a host's immune mechanisms. In this study, we examined the pathogen <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> and identified new bacterial virulence factors that interact with different parts of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> innate immune system. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify <italic>F. novicida</italic> genes required for growth and survival within the fly and identified a set of 149 negatively selected mutants. Among these, we identified a class of genes including the transcription factor oxyR, and the DNA repair proteins uvrB, recB, and ruvC that help <italic>F. novicida</italic> resist oxidative stress. We determined that these bacterial genes are virulence factors that allow <italic>F. novicida</italic> to counteract the fly melanization immune response. We then performed a second in vivo screen to identify an additional subset of bacterial genes that interact specifically with the imd signaling pathway. Most of these mutants have decreased resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B. Characterization of a mutation in the putative transglutaminase FTN_0869 produced a curious result that could not easily be explained using known <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune responses. By using an unbiased genetic screen, these studies provide a new view of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response from the perspective of a pathogen. We show that two branches of the fly's immunity are important for fighting <italic>F. novicida</italic> infections in a model host: melanization and an imd-regulated immune response, and identify bacterial genes that specifically counteract these host responses. Our work suggests that there may be more to learn about the fly immune system, as not all of the phenotypes we observe can be readily explained by its interactions with known immune responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>To infect a host and survive attacks from the host immune system, bacteria express genes that allow them to counteract immune responses. By identifying these genes we can learn how hosts fight infections and how bacteria resist immune attacks. We identified <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> genes that interact with the fruit fly immune system by performing a genetic screen of bacterial mutants. We identified genes that when mutated cause the bacteria to grow poorly within the fly. Many of these genes were shown to help the bacteria survive oxidative stress, providing resistance to an immune response known as melanization. We then identified bacterial genes that interact with another branch of the immune system, the imd pathway, by performing a second screen in imd mutant flies. We identified bacterial mutants that cannot grow in wild-type flies but are rescued in imd mutants, indicating an interaction with this pathway. We followed up one example from this screen and found that mutants in the gene FTN_0869 grow normally inside cells, but cannot grow extracellularly. We found that this was due to being unable to resist previously unexplored aspects of the imd-regulated immune response that help fight off <italic>F. novicida</italic> infections.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The outcome of any infection, whether it be clearance of the infecting pathogen, establishment of a persistent infection, or even death of the host is determined by contributions from both the host and the microbe <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Finlay1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To infect a susceptible host microbes express virulence factors, genes that allow the pathogen to invade, colonize, and survive within the host and cause essential pathology. In response, the host initiates an immune response that attempts to clear the pathogen and increase tolerance to the ensuing infection <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Consequently, in addition to genes that allow the bacteria to invade host cells and obtain nutrients from its host, a subset of the virulence factors expressed by the microbe must address the need of the bacteria to counteract the host immune response. Exploring this complex interplay between host and pathogen can help us to understand bacterial pathogenesis and define the contributions of the host immune system to bacterial virulence.</p><p>One way to explore the host-pathogen relationship is to apply model systems that allow us to dissect the genetics of both sides of the equation simultaneously <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1001065-Persson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In this study, we examine the host-pathogen interactions of <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> with an insect host, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and identify aspects of fly immunity that are most important for fighting <italic>F. novicida</italic> infection as well as the bacterial virulence factors that interact with each of these specific immune responses. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is used as a model of innate immunity because its simplicity and the ease at which it can be used for both forward and reverse genetics has allowed for the identification and characterization of aspects of the innate immune response that are conserved across evolution <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001065-ShirasuHiza1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The fly immune response has three effector arms: an inducible antimicrobial peptide (AMP) response, a reactive oxygen response mediated by the activation of the enzyme phenoloxidase and the deposition of the pigment melanin, and a cellular immune response in which foreign invaders are phagocytosed by <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Uvell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The humoral AMP response has been studied extensively and shown to be regulated by two pattern recognition pathways, Toll and imd which have been well-characterized and described, but the regulatory mechanisms of the melanization and cellular immune responses have only recently become the focus of increased interest and have not yet been fully elucidated <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Aggarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies with pathogenic bacteria in the fly have shown that virulence factors that function in the vertebrate hosts of these pathogens are often required for the microbe to survive in the fly <xref rid="ppat.1001065-ShirasuHiza1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Recently, this has been shown to be true for the live vaccine strain (LVS) of the virulent pathogen <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, a Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacterium that is the causative agent of tularemia <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Vonkavaara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. <italic>F. tularensis</italic> can infect a wide range of hosts that includes humans, but is more commonly associated with rabbits and small rodents. Unlike many of the pathogens used in previous fly studies, <italic>F. tularensis</italic> also has a documented arthropod vector phase in its natural life-cycle <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Nigrovic1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. While many arthropod-vectored pathogens can only be transmitted by a single specific species, <italic>F. tularensis</italic> is able to infect arthropods ranging from ticks to multiple species of mosquito to biting flies such as deerflies <xref rid="ppat.1001065-1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001065-Klock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This makes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system particularly useful for studying both general <italic>F. tularensis</italic> host-pathogen interactions and insect-specific factors.</p><p>To date, the fly has primarily been used to dissect the function of known bacterial virulence factors or to demonstrate conservation between fly and vertebrate defenses. Less has been done to use forward genetic approaches in the microbe to identify virulence factors <italic>de novo</italic>. As immunologists we tend concentrate on known signaling pathways that have proven simple to study, are of interest to those working in vertebrates because they are conserved, and those that fit our idea of what the fly's immune response should be. In other words, experiments are driven by the interests of the scientists and not the pathogens. We took a more ecology-based approach and determined, from scratch, what this fly pathogen needs to kill the fly. The advantage of the fly is that it is inexpensive, rapid to use and has extensive genetic tools. The fly could be a useful tool for the identification of new virulence factors rather than a system used to study known factors.</p><p>To identify new virulence factors and examine their interactions with the fly immune system, we used the <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> strain U112 to infect flies and performed a genome-wide screen to identify factors required for growth and/or survival within the fly. Many of the genes that we identified are required for resistance to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> innate immune response, particularly to the oxidative stress produced by melanization. This is interesting in particular, because until recently, this pathway had been discarded as having no relevance to microbial infections in the fly <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Ayres1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001065-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our work demonstrates that bacterial mutants can be used as probes of the host immune system to identify what aspects of innate immunity are most important in determining the outcome of an infection.</p><p>To identify additional interactions between the host immune system and bacterial virulence factors, we performed a second genetic screen in which we compared the ability of <italic>F. novicida</italic> mutants to grow in wild type flies to flies with an immunity defect known to affect fly survival in <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infections. These flies lack a functional imd signaling pathway, and we anticipated that this would reveal bacterial mechanisms necessary to circumvent the imd-regulated immune response. The imd pathway is primarily described as inducing antimicrobial peptides. Although we identified bacterial genes required to resist antimicrobial peptide killing <italic>in vitro</italic>, we were particularly intrigued to find a subset of genes that when mutated did not appear to change <italic>F. novicida</italic> sensitivity to the antimicrobial peptide we tested yet showed an altered phenotype in imd mutants. This suggests the possibility that there are previously undescribed immune mechanisms that are regulated by the imd pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> ssp. <italic>novicida</italic> infections of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>
</title><p>We infected flies with <italic>F. novicida</italic> strain U112, a wild type strain that causes virulent infections in its natural mouse and rabbit hosts but is not pathogenic to humans. Previous work using the Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> demonstrated that <italic>F. tularensis</italic> grows to high bacterial levels within flies and causes a lethal infection <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Vonkavaara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Infections of the fly with the U112 strain were consistent with this result, although we found the U112 strain to be slightly more virulent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> than the LVS strain, killing the fly with a median time to death (MTD) of 5 days post-infection with 10<sup>3</sup> CFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001065.s001">Figure S1</xref>). As few as 5 CFU of <italic>F. novicida</italic> U112 were sufficient to kill the fly, and bacterial growth within the fly was exponential approaching 5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> CFU per fly before they succumbed to the infection.

However, due to the extremely high bacterial levels observed within the fly we speculated that a large proportion of the bacteria were growing extracellularly. To test this idea, we performed gentamycin chase assays, infecting flies with <italic>F. novicida</italic> and subsequently injecting them with the non-cell permeable antibiotic gentamycin at various timepoints post infection. This assay kills off extracellular bacteria while leaving bacteria growing within cells intact and allowing us to determine whether the bacteria are growing intracellularly or extracellularly By 24 hours post infection, approximately 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> CFU per fly were found to be localized intracellularly. However, the average total population of bacteria in infected flies was at least 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> CFU per fly, demonstrating that a significant population of bacteria was located extracellularly. Over the course of the infection the total bacteria population increased to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> CFU/fly, while the intracellular population remained steady, indicating that the extracellular population was responsible for the exponential increase in bacteria seen during fly infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This is roughly similar to what has been observed using the LVS strain, although the absolute numbers differ slightly possibly due to the differences in virulence between the two bacterial strains, differences in the host strains or environmental conditions <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Vonkavaara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of <italic>F. novicida</italic> virulence factors with a Transposon Site Hybridization (TraSH) screen</title><p>Having demonstrated that the fly can support <italic>F. novicida</italic> growth we applied this model to the identification of bacterial genes that were important for establishing infection within the fly.

Briefly, flies were infected with the pooled library and the infection was allowed to proceed for two days, at which point the bacterial populations in each fly were harvested. Genomic DNA was then purified from this population of bacteria and from the original input library that had not been subjected to the stresses found within the fly. RNA was amplified from the site of each transposon insertion and the two populations of RNAs were compared by microarray analysis. We identified mutants representing 149 <italic>F. novicida</italic> genes that were negatively selected with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5&#x00025;, indicating that these genes were essential for bacterial growth and survival within the fly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001065.s004">Table S1</xref>). 41 of these genes had previously been identified as negatively selected in a similar TraSH analysis performed with the same mutant library in an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model; this list includes the known virulence genes iglC, iglD, pdpA, and pdpB, and mglA <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, 11 genes from our screen overlapped with data from a negative selection screen performed by <italic>Kraemer et al.</italic> using an inhalation model to observe respiratory infections in the mouse, and an additional 8 overlapped with a signature-tagged mutagenesis screen performed by <italic>Su et al.</italic> that also used an intranasal route of inoculation <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

tested 65 of the negatively selected mutants individually by competition assay, focusing on mutants that had particularly large decreases in abundance and/or showed homology to bacterial genes that we

Transposon insertion mutants of each gene containing a kanamycin resistance cassette were tested to determine their ability to grow in competition with wild-type <italic>F. novicida</italic>. Each mutant was mixed with wild-type bacteria and injected into wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> at a 1&#x02236;1 ratio. Infected flies were incubated for 48 hours, at which point the bacteria in each fly were plated and the ratio of mutant to wild-type bacterial was determined. A competitive index of 1 represents an equal ratio of mutant to wild-type bacteria, while competitive indexes of less than one indicate that the mutant is attenuated. Mutants that were determined to be statistically significantly less than 1 by one sample t-test in a minimum of three repetitions were considered attenuated and are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Mutants that were confirmed as negatively selected included kdpA, kdpC, kdpD, and kdpE, components of 2-component regulatory system that responds to turgor pressure, a number of genes known to be regulated by the virulence factor mglA, members of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) thought to be involved in substrate transport and drug resistance, multiple genes know to be involved in DNA repair, and a number of hypothetical proteins.

<italic>F. novicida</italic> mutants demonstrating increased sensitivity to oxidative stress are attenuated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
</title><p>One set of negatively selected mutants stood out as particularly interesting because they indicated a bacterial requirement for resistance to oxidative stress within the fly.

In addition, all of the DNA damage repair mutants showed a significant degree of sensitivity to both reactive oxygen-producing agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that we identified a class of <italic>F. novicida</italic> genes that are essential for wild-type growth and survival within the fly, genes which help the bacteria to resist oxidative stress.

<xref rid="ppat.1001065-Mohapatra1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Therefore, we wished to determine whether the other <italic>F. novicida</italic> genes identified in our rescue screen are also sensitive to AMPs. There are 7 families of AMPs in Drosophila, and more than 2 dozen individual AMPs can be expressed during an infection, producing a complex bacteriocidal cocktail. Among the characterized AMPS, four families have been implicated in killing Gram-negative microbes, attacin, cecropin, diptericin, and drosocin. The first three families contain cation rich peptides while drosocin is described as proline rich <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Uvell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is currently impossible to recreate <italic>in vitro</italic>, the array of AMPs brought to bear on an infecting microbe <italic>in vivo</italic>. We therefore tried testing individual AMPs for their effects on <italic>F. novicida</italic> mutants. Unfortunately, few of these <italic>Drosophila</italic> AMPs are available commercially. We tested a commercial preparation of cecropin and did not detect activity against F.novicida on plates (data not shown). We turned to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B, which has been used to model AMP sensitivity in <italic>F. tularensis</italic> in multiple studies <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Mohapatra1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Of the seven genes we confirmed to be rescued in imd mutant flies, we found that five of these genes, pmrA, FTN_0889, glpD, udp, and FTN_0649 were indeed more sensitive to polymyxin B <italic>in vitro</italic>. Suprisingly, mutants in the genes FTN_0869 and nadC did not show any phenotypes in these assays, suggesting that the imd rescue phenotype of these mutants may not be due AMP sensitivity, or at least not to cationic AMP sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). To determine how common this phenotype was, we expanded our analysis to include the entire set of confirmed attenuated mutants described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g002">Figure 2</xref>. We found that twelve of the fourteen <italic>F. novicida</italic> mutants that were rescued in imd mutant flies on arrays showed altered sensitivity to polymyxin B, whereas this was the case with just five of the thirty eight mutants not rescued in an imd mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These five mutants were likely exceptions as they also had defects in reactive oxygen sensitivity and in the absence of an imd mediated response would still be sensitive to a melanization response. In our entire set of attenuated mutants, only nadC and FTN_0869 mutants demonstrated the unique phenotype of rescue in an imd mutant fly without showing any increased sensitivity to AMPs, so we chose to focus on one of these genes, the putative transglutaminase FTN_0869 for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>FTN_0869 deletion mutants are attenuated in wild-type flies due to clearance of extracellular bacteria by an imd-dependent immune response</title><p>The mutation in the gene FTN_0869 was intriguing as it clearly grows better in imd mutants as compared to wild type flies yet the mutant does not demonstrate altered sensitivity to the antimicrobial peptide we tested.

Regardless, the resistance of FTN_0869 mutants to an AMP raises the question that the imd pathway might be generating an immune response that was not AMP mediated. In addition, the fact that this gene is regulated by the virulence factor mglA which regulates the <italic>F. tularensis</italic> pathogenicity island and many other important virulence factors suggested that it could be particularly important to <italic>F. tularensis</italic> pathogenesis.

As expected, the mglA mutants showed no bacterial growth within the fly but rather were partially cleared very quickly following injection into the fly, and were completely unable to establish an intracellular population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests that the small intracellular population may be important, if not essential, for the establishment of a successful infection.

Therefore, we were interested in investigating this mutant further to determine what effector arm of the innate immune system was responsible for the clearance of extracellular bacteria. We hypothesized that this clearance could be due to either an increased activation of the imd pathway by the FTN_0869 mutants, AMP activity that we were unable to test <italic>in vitro</italic>, or a novel component of the imd-regulated immune response. To determine if the imd pathway is induced more intensely by the FTN_0869 mutant, to rule out the possibility that this gene is able to downregulate the imd immune response, we measured the induction of imd-regulated AMPS as a readout for imd pathway activation. We used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to monitor the levels of Diptericin, Drosocin, Drosomycin, Attacin, Cecropin and Metchnikowin at 1,2,5 and 24 hours post-infection. We found that only Metchnikowin, Cecropin, and Diptericin were strongly induced in response to <italic>F. novicida</italic> infections and that the transcript levels of each of these highly-induced AMPs peaked at 24 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and data not shown). All of these AMPs were induced to similar levels during infections with either the wild-type or FTN-0869 mutant bacteria, with no statistically significant difference between induction by wild-type or mutant bacteria at any timepoint.

The kinetics of the clearance of extracellular FTN_0869 mutant bacteria are too rapid to be attributed to antimicrobial peptide induction. At one hour post infection, clearance of FTN_0869 mutants has already begun. While only 2.8&#x00025; of U112 CFUs are intracellular at 1 hour, 29&#x00025; of FTN_0869 mutant bacteria is already intracellular presumably because the total number of CFUs present in the fly has reduced from 10<sup>4</sup> per fly to 2&#x0002a;10<sup>3</sup> per fly. By two and five hours post-infection at 29&#x000b0;C wild-type bacteria have both extracellular and intracellular populations and have begun to replicate.

We therefore tried an indirect approach to test their importance. Recent work in the beetle <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> demonstrated that the majority of bacteria injected into the insect is cleared in less than an hour post-infection, much faster than antimicrobial peptides can be upregulated, transcribed, and synthesized <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Haine1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Using this larger insect model, Haine et al. were able to conclusively demonstrate that insect antimicrobial peptide activity is induced slowly, and thus is not responsible for the bulk of the bacterial clearance. The analysis of antimicrobial peptide induction in the fly relies on the analysis of mRNA transcript levels, which are less accurate kinetically than a direct measurement of antimicrobial activity but nevertheless suggest that a slow induction with transcript levels only rising hours after infection and peaking at 6&#x02013;24 hours post-infection for various AMPs <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Lemaitre2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

By two hours post-infection, the timepoint at which both wild-type and mutant bacteria had begun to enter cells, the wild-type bacteria now had both intracellular and extracellular populations, while in FTN_0869 mutant infections only the intracellular bacteria had survived clearance. By five hours post infection the extracellular population of U112 wild-type bacteria had begun to increase while the titer of FTN_0869 mutants did not and only the intracellular population remained.

We concluded that the imd rescue phenotype of FTN_0869 mutants not likely due to cationic antimicrobial peptides or melanization and rather suggested a third category of <italic>F. novicida</italic> interactions with the fly immune system as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001065-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our goal was to dissect the host-pathogen interactions between <italic>Francisella</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. To identify components of this complex system we used a combination of three genetic techniques that enabled us to determine the contributions of both host and microbe to the virulence of the infection. First, we identified bacterial virulence factors necessary to infect the fly using a library of <italic>F. novicida</italic> mutants. Second, we used fly immunity mutants to confirm which host immune pathways were essential for fighting <italic>F. novicida</italic> infections. Finally, we combined these two techniques to identify subsets of bacterial virulence factors that allow the bacteria to counter-respond to specific immune attacks and evade immune clearance. This paper identifies genes from both the pathogen and the host that are components of each of these aspects of the host-pathogen relationship.</p><p>To identify bacterial virulence factors, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> screen that identified 149 bacteria genes that are important for growth and survival within the fly. 41 of the 149 genes had previously been identified in a similar screen performed with the same bacterial library in the mouse indicating that many bacterial virulence factors are conserved between host species <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001065-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Genes that overlap between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse screens include known virulence factors such as mglA, iglC, and iglD, a number of various transporters, and some of the DNA repair genes we identified as helping <italic>F. novicida</italic> to survive oxidative stress. The remaining genes are unique to our screen performed in the fly model. These genes could either represent <italic>F. novicida</italic> genes that play a role specific to arthropod vectors, demonstrate a stronger phenotype in insects than in mammals, or were not identified in previous screens for experimental reasons.</p><p>We note that of the 26 <italic>F.novicida</italic> mutants identified as being sensitive to reactive oxygen, 7 (27&#x00025;) had been previously identified as being important for virulence in vertebrates. In contrast, of the 16 mutants we found to be polymixin sensitive, only 1 (7&#x00025;) was identified previously as being important for virulence in vertebrates. The numbers in this study are small enough that differences in representation could be due to chance and therefore future work with more pathogens will be required to confirm the trends seen here; that said, analysis of interactions with the fly's reactive oxygen based immune response seems to be useful predictor of genes that will be of interest to those studying vertebrates. In contrast, analysis of the AMP and imd sensitive mutants is not as robust a tool for identifying mutations that will are relevant in vertebrates.</p><p>Secondary screens of these mutants revealed important patterns that shed light onto what particular stresses <italic>F. novicida</italic> encounters within the fly. 25 of the 56 mutants that we confirmed to have reduced competitive indexes compared to wild-type <italic>F. novicida</italic> were also hyper sensitive to oxidative stress <italic>in vitro</italic>. This indicates that preventing or repairing damage caused by reactive oxygen species is an important survival strategy for <italic>F. novicida</italic> in insect infections. Of particular interest among the genes that were sensitive to oxidative stress was the gene oxyR, which has homology to an <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptional regulator that senses and responds to the presence of hydrogen peroxide by inducing the transcription of catalases and other genes that can counteract oxidative stress <sup>23</sup>. In addition, our screen identified multiple genes in DNA damage repair pathways that are also sensitive to oxidative stress <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Nowosielska1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Imlay1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We expect that these genes are required to repair damage caused by reactive oxygen species to DNA as has been suggested by <italic>Kraemer et al</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1001065-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Of the three effector arms that have been characterized in the immune response occurring within the fly's body cavity, the major producer of oxidative stress is the melanization response <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Ayres1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Nappi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we speculated that the large number of negatively selected bacterial mutants with oxidative stress sensitivity phenotypes suggested that the melanization response plays a large role in the fly's immune response to <italic>F. novicida</italic>. To test this hypothesis, we performed competition assays with the oxyR mutants in fly mutants that lack a melanization response. As expected, the attenuation of these mutants was rescued in flies that do not melanize and therefore would be expected to not produce toxic oxygen species. This demonstrated that melanization is an essential component of the fly immune response against <italic>F. novicida</italic> and demonstrated that we could use our characterizations of bacterial genes to learn about the fly immune system and understand the host-pathogen relationship. We note that reactive oxygen is a well-established immune effector in the Drosophila gut. Perhaps most microbes encountering the fly will face this immune barrier before encountering internal immune defenses. Thus protection against reactive oxygen is doubly important for fly pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Because microbes must withstand the host immune system to mount a successful infection, we were able to exploit the inherent ability of bacteria to function as metaphorical immunologists to identify which aspects of fly immunity were important to <italic>F. novicida</italic> infections. We next sought to determine if this system could be used in the reverse direction by manipulating the fly immune system to identify which bacterial virulence factors were responsible for interacting with one specific aspect of innate immunity. We did this by performing a second round of our <italic>in vivo</italic> screen for bacterial mutants in an immunocompromised fly. We focused on the imd-regulated humoral immune response, which had previously been identified as important for fighting <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infections <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Vonkavaara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We confirmed that the imd pathway, but not the Toll pathway, was essential in combating <italic>F. novicida</italic> infections, and performed our TraSH assay in imd mutant flies. We identified a subset of bacterial virulence factors that were important for infections of wild-type flies but not imd flies; this imd-regulated immune response has been primarily characterized for its role in the induction of antimicrobial peptides and therefore we tested these mutants for their sensitivity to a cationic, membrane active antimicrobial peptide, polymyxin B <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Mohapatra1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. As expected, twelve of the fourteen mutants were sensitive to polymyxin killing <italic>in vitro</italic>, providing another example of how resistance to host immune responses is an important component of bacterial virulence.</p><p>We identified 2 bacterial mutants that were not sensitive to polymyxin <italic>in vitro</italic> despite being rescued in imd mutants flies. This phenotype was unexpected as the majority of the literature suggests imd signaling drives antimicrobial peptide production and this is its most important job. We propose three explanations for this phenotype. First, the rescue phenotype could be due to specific sensitivity to additional antimicrobial peptides that were not tested <italic>in vitro</italic>; the bacteria show no sensitivity to polymyxin but could be sensitive to one of the 30 or more AMPs synthesized by flies. Second, the rescue phenotype could be due to the bacterial gene being an inhibitor of the imd pathway; in this case the bacteria would have wild type sensitivity to AMPs but would encounter increased concentrations of them in the fly because the bacteria could not inhibit AMP production. Finally, the rescue phenotype of these bacterial mutants could be due to an aspect of imd-regulated immunity that has not been previously described.</p><p>To differentiate between these possibilities, we chose one imd-rescue mutant, the putative transglutaminase FTN_0869 to characterize further in terms of its interactions with the fly immune system. We chose this gene because it had a strongly attenuated phenotype in wild-type flies that was significantly rescued in imd mutants and because it has previously been shown to be regulated by the virulence factor mglA, which is essential for <italic>F. novicida</italic> intracellular growth <sup>28</sup>. More recently, the homologue of this gene in the extremely virulent Type A <italic>F. tularensis</italic> ssp. <italic>tularensis</italic> strain Shu4 was identified in a transcriptional analysis of genes that are upregulated inside mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Wehrly1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Interestingly, FTN_0869 deletion mutants in the less virulent U112 strain are unable to replicate in BMMs, but mutants of the homologue of this gene, FTT0989 in the SCHU4 strain did not demonstrate any intracellular replication defect <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Brotcke1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001065-Wehrly1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Further characterization of the FTN_0869 mutants showed that these mutants are attenuated for both lethality to the fly and bacterial growth in an imd-dependent manner. However, unlike its transcriptional regulator mglA, the FTN_0869 mutant is capable of intracellular growth within flies, but is incapable of surviving in the extracellular space. This phenotype is consistent with what is observed in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages with the virulent Shu4 strain, but not with the phenotype of FTN_0869 deletion mutants in the U112 strain. The reason for this difference is unclear, but it is interesting to note that the ability of the putative transglutaminase deletion mutants to grow intracellularly correlates with its virulence in mammalian and insect hosts.</p><p>We found that the phenotype of FTN_0869 deletion mutants in flies is imd-dependent, and used this phenotype to investigate the role of the imd pathway in clearing the extracellular bacteria. With this mutant, we were able to show that the imd rescue phenotype of this particular mutant was not due to modulation of the imd pathway because AMP genes downstream of imd are induced to similar amounts in infections with wild-type and FTN_0869 bacteria. By examining the kinetics of the clearance of extracellular bacteria, we were able to limit the possibility that other imd-induced antimicrobial peptides that we did not test <italic>in vitro</italic> were causing the attenuation of the FTN_0869 mutant. Using non-melanizing mutants, we were able to rule out melanization as the cause of this phenotype, leaving us with the possibility that imd could either be regulating the cellular immune response or an uncharacterized effector arm of fly immunity. Thus the FTN_0869 phenotype suggested a third category of host-pathogen interactions between <italic>F. novicida</italic> and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> innate immune system. Future work with this mutant and other imd-rescue mutants identified in our screen could provide further insight into the biology of the imd-regulated fly immune response.</p><p>In summary, reciprocal studies of a pathogen, <italic>F. novicida</italic> and a host, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, allowed us to identify genes in the pathogen required to counteract, evade, or resist host immune responses and allow bacterial growth and survival. These studies identified two branches of host immunity that are important for fighting <italic>F. novicida</italic> infections, melanization and imd-regulated immune responses and helped us to understand how the bacteria resists these responses. By identifying the mechanism of one or two bacterial mutants based on their sequence or interaction with fly mutants we developed assays to identify the mechanism of mutants with unknown function. Our work with one of these mutants, FTN_0869, taught us that there is likely more to learn about the fly immune system as there are classes of <italic>F. novicida</italic> mutants that cannot immediately be explained by their interactions with the melanization response or AMPs. Our screen allowed us to pose directed questions and focus our investigations on particular aspects of the host immune system and the microbial strategies to evade this immune response, helping us to identify and characterize components of the host-pathogen relationship.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Drosophila strains</title><p>All experiments were performed in wild-type Oregon Red (OR) flies unless otherwise noted.
