Despite the importance of radical radiotherapy for the management of this disease, recurrence remains a challenge. PTEN is a tumour suppressor that is frequently inactivated in advanced prostate cancer and has been associated with relapse following radiotherapy. The present study shows that the role of PTEN in response to ionizing radiation is complex. Furthermore, it demonstrates that in the absence of PTEN, an increased response to combined treatment using radiotherapy and the ATM inhibitor KU-60019 can be observed. Our findings provide a strong rationale for evaluating loss of PTEN in prostate cancer as a therapeutic target for ATM inhibitor in combination with radiotherapy in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Abstract</title><p>Radical radiotherapy, often in combination with hormone ablation, is a safe and effective treatment option for localised or locally-advanced prostate cancer. However, up to 30% of patients with locally advanced PCa will go on to develop biochemical failure, within 5 years, following initial radiotherapy. Improving radiotherapy response is clinically important since patients exhibiting biochemical failure develop castrate-resistant metastatic disease for which there is no curative therapy and median survival is 8&#x02013;18 months. The aim of this research was to determine if loss of PTEN (highly prevalent in advanced prostate cancer) is a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Previous work has demonstrated PTEN-deficient cells are sensitised to inhibitors of ATM, a key regulator in the response to DSBs. Here, we have shown the role of PTEN in cellular response to IR was both complex and context-dependent. Secondly, we have confirmed ATM inhibition in PTEN-depleted cell models, enhances ionising radiation-induced cell killing with minimal toxicity to normal prostate RWPE-1 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment significantly inhibited PTEN-deficient tumour growth compared to PTEN-expressing counterparts, with minimal toxicity observed. We have further shown PTEN loss is accompanied by increased endogenous levels of ROS and DNA damage. Taken together, these findings provide pre-clinical data for future clinical evaluation of ATM inhibitors as a neoadjuvant/adjuvant in combination with radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients harbouring PTEN mutations.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>PTEN</kwd><kwd>ATM</kwd><kwd>ionising radiation</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cancers-13-00079"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>External beam radiotherapy is a well-established treatment option for locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Despite the high rates of local tumour control, radioresistance is observed in approximately 20&#x02013;30% of localised PCa patients following initial radiotherapy, leading to cancer-related mortality in up to 27% of patients within 5 years [<xref rid="B1-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Improving radiotherapy response is clinically important since patients exhibiting biochemical failure develop castrate-resistant metastatic disease for which there is no curative therapy and median survival is 8&#x02013;18 months.</p><p>There is a significant clinical need to identify robust tissue biomarkers that will help predict a patient&#x02019;s outcome following radiotherapy. Importantly, such biomarkers may help achieve better tumour response in high-risk patients by selecting patients for more effective personalised treatment plans combining molecularly targeted drugs. The tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently inactivated in approximately 60% of advanced PCa and is widely implicated in the progression to metastatic castrate-resistant PCa [<xref rid="B2-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PTEN loss has further been shown to be a prognostic factor for relapse following radiotherapy in locally advanced PCa [<xref rid="B3-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similarly, AKT hyperactivation, a result of PTEN loss and deregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, correlates with PCa progression and poor clinical outcome [<xref rid="B4-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PTEN loss is reported to confer impaired DNA damage repair and genomic instability [<xref rid="B5-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In pre-clinical studies, PTEN loss in prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells was shown to be synthetically lethal to treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, as a result of impaired transcriptional regulation of Rad51, a key protein involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) [<xref rid="B7-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This association between PTEN loss and PARP inhibitor sensitivity was not observed however in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines [<xref rid="B9-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A previous study from within our group identified PTEN as synthetically lethal with ATM deficiency in an siRNA screen to identify novel genes whose knockdown confers selective sensitivity to ATM loss [<xref rid="B10-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ATM is a key sensory protein involved in regulating the DNA damage response, becoming activated by the formation of DSBs during all phases of the cell cycle. It is also independently activated by oxidative stress, with ATM-deficient cells more susceptible to oxidative-stress inducing agents [<xref rid="B11-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PTEN-deficient in vitro cell and in vivo tumour models were shown to be selectively sensitised to treatment with ATM inhibitors. Increased endogenous ATM activation was observed in PTEN-deficient cells, resulting from high levels of oxidative stress, leading to elevated levels of DSBs. Additionally, sensitisation of PTEN-deficient cells was found to be independent of a defect in Rad51 expression.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to characterise the role of PTEN, given its major role in relapse following radiotherapy, in the response to ionising radiation (IR) in several isogenic models. Using this approach, we tested the ability of the ATM inhibitor KU-60019 to enhance sensitivity to IR in the absence of PTEN using in vitro and in vivo models. Moreover, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in mediating these responses to provide a rationale for the development of future combinations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-cancers-13-00079"><title>2.

The impact of KU-60019 depends on PTEN status in prostate models as DU145 cells had a lower RER (1.28) in comparison to LnCAP and 22RV1 cells (15.72 and 2.975 respectively) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-13-00079">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> and [<xref rid="B10-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). We then confirmed this using inducible and isogenic models. Dose response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-00079-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) were produced for clonogenic survival data following treatment of cells with a clinically relevant 2 Gy dose of ionising radiation (IR), 1 h immediately after treatment with KU-60019. To determine the degree of interaction between KU-60019 and IR as a combined therapy in these cell models, synergy calculations were performed and the combination indices (&#x000b1;1.96 SD) plotted against fraction of cells affected (1- SF) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-13-00079">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Combination index (CI) values &#x0003c;0.9 indicate a synergistic interaction between agents, values of 0.9&#x02013;1.0 suggest additive interaction, whereas values &#x0003e;1.0 indicate antagonistic interactions.</p><p>In each of the isogenic models investigated, antagonistic interaction values were produced in both cells with and without PTEN at lower treatment concentrations. As the fraction of cells affected increased (treatment concentrations increased), much greater synergism was observed in PC-3 and HCT-116 PTEN-deficient cells compared to cells expressing PTEN. In the normal prostate RWPE-1 cell line, an antagonistic interaction was observed. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-13-00079">Supplementary Table S3</xref> shows combination index values for each cell type treated with 2 Gy + 1 &#x000b5;M KU-60019.</p><p>The radiation enhancement ratio (RER), obtained by dividing the mean SF for KU-60019 [1 &#x000b5;M] by the mean SF for KU-60019 + IR [1 &#x000b5;M + 2 Gy], was also used as a determinant of radiosensitisation (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-13-00079">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). KU-60019 appears to be a potent radiosensitiser of both PTEN expressing and deficient cells but significantly greater radiosensitisation was observed in a PTEN-deficient context in each of the cell models. In the HCT-116s, RER was 9.2 times greater in PTEN-deficient cells vs. PTEN expressing cells (19 vs. 2.02).</p><p>Due to the potent radiosensitisation of KU-60019, it was desirable to improve the targeted sensitisation of the PTEN-deficient cells.

LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations for PTEN-deficient PC-3 and HCT-116 cell lines were 21.3 nM and 137 nM respectively.

Furthermore, &#x003b3;H2AX and Rad51 foci analysis suggested PTEN has a negligible role in HR repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-00079-f004">Figure 4</xref>). We did however identify elevated oxidative damage as a potential driver of PTEN-cell radiosensitivity in the PC-3 and HCT-116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-00079-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Previously, loss of PTEN was shown to sensitise various cancer cells to ATM inhibition [<xref rid="B10-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B28-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the present study, we have confirmed that inhibition of ATM by KU-60019 in combination with IR, is synergistically cytotoxic to PTEN-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-00079-f002">Figure 2</xref>), eliciting an increase in G2/M cell populations and apoptosis induction.

Several previous studies have similarly reported high endogenous levels of DNA damage in PTEN-deficient cells [<xref rid="B24-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>We further speculate that these elevated levels of DNA damage are induced by high levels of ROS, with antioxidant treatment reducing IR-induced &#x003b3;-H2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-00079-f005">Figure 5</xref>). More work is required to determine the cause of high ROS levels, however, one potential cause is the hyperactivation of AKT, known to drive cellular metabolism, of which ROS are a by-product. Independent of AKT, the loss of PTEN is reported to impede regulation of oxidative damage, with PTEN accumulating in the nucleus following oxidative stress where it associates with p53 to enhance cell cycle arrest and reduce ROS levels [<xref rid="B30-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has also been clearly found that selective sensitivity of PTEN-depleted cells to ATM inhibition is directly related to the actions of KU-60019 in reducing phosphorylation of AKT (elevated in cells lacking PTEN) at ser473 [<xref rid="B31-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Only recently have ATM inhibitors started to be tested in clinical trials, (NCT02588105) building on several promising in vivo studies using ATM inhibitors [<xref rid="B32-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-cancers-13-00079" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study identified potent radiation sensitising effects of KU-60019 on PTEN-deficient cells and xenograft tumours. Our results suggest this sensitivity is mediated by elevated oxidative damage rather than the cells&#x02019; capacities to repair DNA damage. Inhibiting ATM-mediated regulation of oxidative damage in these cells harbouring elevated endogenous DNA damage, further contributed to by IR-induced DSBs, creates an accumulative DNA damage burden that is lethal. We speculate elevated levels of oxidative damage in PTEN-deficient cells are driven by hyperactivation of AKT.</p><p>Elucidating PTEN loss as a therapeutic target for combined IR with pharmacological inhibition of ATM presents a promising novel treatment approach in PCa. Using gene expression profiling, it would be possible to identify patient tumours with PTEN mutations, suitable for treatment with ATM inhibitors as a neo-adjuvant or adjuvant with radiotherapy. This therapeutic strategy may help reduce the rates of biochemical failure observed in locally advanced PCa and prevent the progression to metastatic CRPC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Professor T Waldman for the HCT-116 PTEN isogenic cell line model.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-cancers-13-00079"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/1/79/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/1/79/s1</uri>, Table S1: Radiobiological parameters derived from the LQ-fitted clonogenic survival data.

CI values were generated using Calcusyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) based on methods of Chou and Talalay. A CI value &#x0003c; 0.90 is indicative of synergistic interactions, CI of 0.90 to 1.0 indicates additive interactions, and CI &#x0003e; 1.0 indicates antagonistic interactions. Points 5 = 10 nM, 4 = 100 nM, 3 = 500 nM, 2 = 1 &#x003bc;M and 1 = 10 &#x003bc;M of KU-60019. Figure S3: (A) Cell-cycle analysis using Propidium iodide (PI) staining and detection by flow cytometry of HCT-116 WT and KO22 cell models after treatment with 1&#x003bc;M KU-60019 and 2 Gy IR, as single modalities and in combination. Analyses of cell cycle distributions 48 h post-treatment are shown. (B) Caspase 3/7 activity in HCT-116 WT and KO22 cell models following treatment with 1&#x003bc;M KU-60019 and 4 Gy IR alone or in combination. Activity was measured using a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit 48 h post-treatment. Figure S4: (A) Levels of DNA damage in HCT-116 WT and KO22 cells following KU-60019 and IR alone or in combination. Mean &#x003b3;-H2AX foci per cell was plotted at 1, 4 and 24 h post-treatment with 1 Gy IR or 1 Gy + 1 &#x003bc;M KU-60019. Differences between two groups were compared by using a two-sample student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test (one asterisk (*), <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; two asterisks (**), <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). (B) Mean Rad51 foci per cell in HCT-116 WT and KO22 cells basally and 1 h following 2 Gy ionising radiation. Differences between two groups were compared by using a two-sample student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. NS denotes a non-significant difference. (C) Western blot analysis showing basal expression of total Rad51 in HCT-116 WT and KO22 cell models. Figure S5: Immunofluorescence images of (A) PC-3 and (B) HCT-116 isogenic models showing staining of phosphorylated histone H2AX foci (&#x003b3;-H2AX) (Green) and 4,6- diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Blue). Images were taken of cells at 1, 4 and 24 h post-treatment with 1&#x003bc;M KU-60019 and 1 Gy IR alone or in combination.
