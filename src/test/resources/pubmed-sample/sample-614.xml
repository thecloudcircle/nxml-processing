We have shown that VEGF increases permeability of retinal endothelial cells (REC) by inducing expression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). The purpose of this study was to define the role of superoxide anion in VEGF/uPAR expression and BRB breakdown in diabetes. Studies were performed in streptozotocin diabetic rats and mice and high glucose (HG) treated REC. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic tempol blocked diabetes-induced permeability and uPAR expression in rats and the cell permeable SOD inhibited HG-induced expression of uPAR and VEGF in REC. Inhibiting VEGFR blocked HG-induced expression of VEGF and uPAR and GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation in REC. HG caused &#x003b2;-catenin translocation from the plasma membrane into the cytosol and nucleus. Treatment with HG-conditioned media increased REC paracellular permeability that was blocked by anti-uPA or anti-uPAR antibodies. Moreover, deletion of uPAR blocked diabetes-induced BRB breakdown and activation of MMP-9 in mice. Together, these data indicate that diabetes-induced oxidative stress triggers BRB breakdown by a mechanism involving uPAR expression through VEGF-induced activation of the GSK3&#x003b2;/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants: EY04618, EY11766 and pre-doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships from the American Heart Association.

The vascular permeability defect has been attributed to elevated blood glucose levels (for review, please see <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are also evident in retinal tissue and ocular fluids of diabetic patients and animals and are likely mediated by an increase in oxidative stress [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although diabetes- and high glucose-induced increases in superoxide anion have been well-documented [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the specific relationship between superoxide anion generation and BRB breakdown has not been elucidated. Anti-VEGF therapies have shown promise in reducing vascular leakage and macular edema in diabetic patients. However, in light of the potential for adverse effects with repeated anti-VEGF injections and the beneficial actions of VEGF as a survival factor (reviewed in <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), there is great need for additional anti-permeability therapies. Thus, a more precise definition of the mechanisms involved in the diabetes-induced permeability increase is needed.</p><p>We and others have shown that diabetes-induced retinal vascular permeability and VEGF-induced paracellular permeability in retinal endothelial cells are accompanied by increases in expression of the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator (uPAR) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Urokinase (uPA) is a serine proteinase that is expressed constitutively in endothelial cells. It is secreted in latent pro-form as a single chain 50kDa peptide, but is rapidly activated upon binding to uPAR. Upon activation, uPA converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin activates several pro-forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), generating a cascade of proteinase activation at the cell surface [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This leads to degradation of the extracellular matrix and disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix attachments. The role of this proteolytic cascade in diabetes-induced breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier has been supported by studies showing that treatment with inhibitors of MMP or uPA blocks diabetes-induced breakdown of the BRB [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but the upstream mediators of this process are as yet unknown.</p><p>Vascular endothelial cell paracellular permeability function is regulated by adherens and tight junctions [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In adherens junctions, &#x003b2;-catenin links the intracellular domain of VE cadherin to actin microfilaments via &#x003b1;-catenin [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to this structural role, &#x003b2;-catenin acts as an intracellular signaling molecule and is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. In differentiated cells, &#x003b2;-catenin is predominantly bound to the plasma membrane and free cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3&#x003b2; (glycogen synthase kinase) which targets it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Upon growth factor or Wnt signaling, GSK3&#x003b2; is phosphorylated and deactivated. Under these conditions, &#x003b2;-catenin escapes ubiquitination, accumulates in the cytosol and translocates into the nucleus where it serves as a co-transcription factor to activate a variety of genes associated with cell migration and proliferation, including uPAR [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that diabetes/high glucose increases superoxide anion formation that drives VEGF expression and retinal vascular permeability by activating the GSK3&#x003b2;, &#x003b2;-catenin, uPAR pathway. We tested this hypothesis by studies with inhibiting superoxide anion in vivo and in high glucose-treated endothelial cells as well as uPAR knockout diabetic mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Primary cultures of bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (REC) were prepared according to our established protocol [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Prior to all experimental procedures, medium was switched to a serum-free endothelial basal medium (EBM, Clonetics, San Diego CA) including 0.1% BSA, with or without 25 mM glucose and various inhibitors for the designated times. The high glucose treated REC-conditioned media (HGCM) were prepared by incubating the cells with high glucose (25 mM) for 2-3 days. Control conditioned media were prepared by incubating cells for the same length of time in serum free (EBM/BSA) medium with normal glucose (5.5 mM glucose) or medium containing L-glucose (19.5 mM L-glucose, 5.5mM D-glucose; final concentration of 25 mM). Conditioned media were collected and concentrated 10 fold by spin-filtration (10 kDa cutoff membrane, Millipore UFV4BK10) and added to the cultures.

The high glucose-induced increases in VEGF, uPAR and phosphorylation of GSK3&#x003b2; are mediated at least in part via autocrine activation of VEGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g004">4</xref>). 3. High glucose and VEGF caused nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin and increased REC permeability in a uPA/uPAR dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g005">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g006">6</xref>). 4. Deletion of uPAR in mice preserved the BRB and blocked diabetes-induced increases in MMP9 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Based on these results we conclude that diabetes-induced oxidative stress triggers BRB breakdown by a mechanism that involves uPAR expression through VEGF-induced activation of the GSK-3 &#x003b2;/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0071868-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0071868.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Hypothesized scheme of events</title><p>for how diabetes/hyperglycemia induced oxidative stress triggers VEGF-mediated uPAR expression and consequent BRB breakdown, and the experimental approaches that produced the supporting data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0071868.g008"/></fig><p>Although diabetes and high glucose-induced increases in superoxide anion have been well-documented [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the direct effects and possible mechanisms of reducing superoxide anion on BRB breakdown have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that treatment of diabetic rats with continuous infusion of the SOD mimetic tempol completely blocked diabetes-induced BRB breakdown. These protective effects were associated with significant decreases in lipid peroxidation and tyrosine nitration in the diabetic retina. These results are consistent with a recent report showing that administration of tempol prevented retinal tyrosine nitration and pericyte cell death and preserved BRB&#x000a0;in Akita diabetic mice [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The latter study did not examine the direct effects of superoxide anion production within endothelial cells. However, overexpression of MnSOD in retinal endothelial cells has been shown to prevent diabetes-induced VEGF expression [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, we further explored the role of inhibiting superoxide anion formation in cultures of REC maintained in high glucose. Indeed, treatment with the cell permeable SOD blocked high glucose-induced increases in expression of VEGF, uPAR in REC. These observations in REC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g003">3</xref>) along with the finding that tempol significantly reduced diabetes-induced uPAR expression <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g001">Figure 1</xref>) indicate that high glucose induces VEGF and uPAR expression by increasing oxidative stress. These results lend further support to previous reports showing that diabetes-induced oxidative stress and peroxynitrite formation enhance VEGF expression [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], by a mechanism involved activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The findings that HG-induced upregulation of VEGF and uPAR were partially blocked by the VEGFR1/2 inhibitor suggest an autocrine mechanism of VEGF/VEGFR activation. This result is consistent with previous reports that VEGF can induce its own expression in a variety of cell types, including vascular endothelial cells [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The role of VEGF in diabetic retinopathy and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier is well established [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Diabetes/high glucose-induced increases in MMP9 activity in retinal tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> and retinal endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and alterations in composition of the perivascular extracellular matrix have been linked to retinal vascular injury and compromised barrier function [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Previous studies have also implicated increases in uPA and MMP expression and activities in breakdown of the blood retinal barrier [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Investigations using cultured retinal endothelial cells have shown that treatment with exogenous MMP9 and uPA causes an increase in paracellular permeability by a mechanism involving decreases in the tight junction protein occludin [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. VEGF-induced migration and capillary morphogenesis has also been shown to be mediated by the induction uPAR gene expression [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Expression of uPAR is thought to provide a cellular-based proteolytic system that facilitates activation of uPA and plasminogen. Plasmin digests ECM components and activates pro-matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP9 (for review, please see <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The localization of plasmin and metalloprotease proteolytic activities at the endothelial cell plasma membrane causes loosening of cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts which increases vascular permeability and releases serum proteins and ECM-bound growth factors. To our knowledge, actions of uPA and MMP9 have not been studied in non-vascular cells of the diabetic retina. However, the uPAR proteolytic system has been shown to be involved in retinal pigment epithelial cell migration [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and has been linked to choroidal neovascularization in animal models of age related macular degeneration [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Activity of uPA and MMP9 has also been linked to gliosis and retinal ganglion cell death in experimental models of open angle glaucoma [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]).</p><p>We have shown previously that VEGF treatment induces GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin and increases uPAR gene expression in retinal endothelial cells [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The present study showed that high glucose treatment of retinal endothelial cells substantially increased the accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin within both the cytosolic and nuclear compartments. Also, GSK3&#x003b2; was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner following high glucose treatment. These observations indicate that high glucose causes GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation and deactivation, leading to stabilization and nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin. Our studies in mice confirmed the involvement of the uPA/uPAR system in diabetes-induced breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier.</p><p>Although anti-VEGF therapies have proven successful in reducing vascular leakage and macular edema in diabetic patients [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], most patients require repeated intraocular injections and some do not respond. In addition, depriving the diabetic retina of VEGF can exacerbate diabetes-induced neurodegeneration due to lack of neurotrophic support to neurons. Our studies identified several molecular targets downstream from VEGF that can be further developed as anti-permeability therapies. In summary, as depicted in the graphical abstract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g008">Figure 8</xref>), we have used animal and tissue culture models to demonstrate that diabetes-induced oxidative stress triggers BRB breakdown by a mechanism that involves uPAR expression through VEGF-induced phosphorylation and deactivation of the GSK-3 &#x003b2;/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of VEGFR2 inhibitor, the glucose-induced uPAR expression is abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071868-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This indicates that high glucose utilizes the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway to regulate &#x003b2;-catenin transcriptional activity and uPAR gene expression. Our data also indicate that hyperglycemia induced upregulation of VEGF and activation of VEGFR2 have a role in increasing uPAR expression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Nai-tse Tsai for his excellent technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
