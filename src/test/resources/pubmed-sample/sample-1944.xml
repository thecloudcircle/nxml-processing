The development, details and outcomes of early-to-later phase evaluation of this technique and the quality of evidence to support its adoption into practice have hitherto not been summarised. The aim of this review is to identify and summarise the early and later phase studies of, and evidence for, TORS and to understand how early phase studies report intervention development, governance procedures and selection and reporting of outcomes to optimise methods for using the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) framework for surgical innovation that informs evidence-based practice.

At least two independent researchers will identify studies for inclusion. Two researchers will extract data from each paper. Studies will be categorised into IDEAL stages of study design from &#x02018;pre-IDEAL&#x02019; to randomised controlled trials (stage 3). Data will be collected about the (1) novel intervention and criteria for modification, (2) governance arrangements and patient information provision, (3) outcome domains selected and reported and (4) quality of study design, conduct and reporting. Descriptive statistics and a narrative synthesis will be presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The results of this systematic review will be presented at relevant conferences. The methods will be used to inform future reviews exploring other novel surgical innovations. The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

While surgery offers a chance of cure, it carries major risks, and there can be long-lasting detrimental effects on function and quality of life.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Recent developments in treatment strategies have, therefore, been aimed at organ preservation as well as overall survival.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Such developments have included attenuation in the field and dose of radiotherapy delivery and the introduction of innovative, less destructive surgical approaches including transoral laser and robotic techniques.</p><p>Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is a technique first described in 2005 for the treatment of a benign pharyngeal cyst.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It has since been applied to the resection of oropharyngeal cancers and the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these indications in 2009 and was&#x000a0;subsequently adopted into routine practice in several centres, particularly in the USA.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The National Health Service in England do not routinely commission TORS for the treatment of oropharyngeal or laryngeal cancer.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The technique involves robotically&#x000a0;assisted excision of a tumour or other tissue by an experienced surgeon who operates a control console in the same room but remote from the patient. Putative benefits include less invasive surgical access, better in situ three-dimensional visualisation of the tumour, scaling of movement and elimination of hand tremor.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Reported disadvantages include lack of tactile feedback and high cost.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> There appears, however, to be a lack of synthesised data about the effectiveness of TORS. Factors associated with the development, evaluation and implementation of this innovation have not yet been collated, described or summarised. The extent to which key issues around understanding surgical innovations, including clinical indications for the innovation, which patients are offered the innovation, what information is given to patients to ensure appropriate informed consent in the context of an innovative treatment (and within what governance structure), how the intervention is performed, which modifications are required during development (and what criteria inform decision to modify an intervention) and which outcomes and adverse events are reported in order to document known and potentially unknown consequences of new procedures have been considered also require clarification.</p><p>The Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) framework was developed in 2009 and proposed a prospective, stepwise means of evaluating innovative procedures.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> It aims to help researchers and authors design and report studies of surgical innovation in a transparent way. Widespread adoption of the IDEAL framework by surgical innovators, researchers and journals has yet to be realised, and it is not known if the evolution of technologies such&#x000a0;as TORS has been reported in accordance with this framework. An in-depth analysis of published literature on TORS will provide a case study of the reporting of a recently&#x000a0;developed surgical intervention which is now offered as part of routine practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Overall objective</title><p>This study aims to systematically identify and comprehensively summarise and critique studies reporting the introduction, evolution and evaluation of TORS for obstructive sleep apnoea and oropharyngeal cancer.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Specific research questions</title><p>The novel intervention and criteria for modification&#x000a0;<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How is the novel intervention reported and criteria for modification described?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How were patients selected to receive the intervention?
