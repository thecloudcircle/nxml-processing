Based on their structural similarities the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; islands have been classified as type I to IV. The genomes of highly pathogenic and particularly epidemic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains (USA300, N315, Mu50, NCTC8325, Newman, COL, JH1 or JH9) belonging to the clonal complexes <italic>CC5</italic> and <italic>CC8</italic> bear a type I &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; island. Since the contribution of the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster encoded in the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; island to virulence is unclear to date, we deleted the entire <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300. The results showed that the mutant was deficient in the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes, macrophages and keratinocytes. Purified lipoprotein Lpl1 was further shown to elicit a TLR2-dependent response. Furthermore, heterologous expression of the USA300 <italic>lpl</italic> cluster in other <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains enhanced their immune stimulatory activity. Most importantly, the <italic>lpl</italic> cluster contributed to invasion of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> into human keratinocytes and mouse skin and the non-invasive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> expressing the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster became invasive. Additionally, in a murine kidney abscess model the bacterial burden in the kidneys was higher in wild type than in mutant mice. In this infection model the <italic>lpl</italic> cluster, thus, contributes to virulence. The present report is one of the first studies addressing the role of the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; encoded <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster in staphylococcal virulence.

In general, internalization of a pathogen into host epithelial cells shields the pathogen from immune defense and antibiotic treatment.

This was confirmed by the fact that innate immune activation was significantly decreased in diacylglyceryl transferase enzyme encoding gene (<italic>lgt</italic>) deleted mutants [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The previously described stimulatory activity of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was, thus, most likely due to contamination of the LTA fraction with highly active natural lipoproteins and/or lipopeptides [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>One of the first lipoproteins to be analyzed and described in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> was the membrane bound penicillinase [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The search of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genomes for the lipobox motif revealed approximately 55&#x02013;70 genes encoding putative lipoproteins [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Many of them exert crucial functions as transporters (iron, manganese, nickel, zinc, amino acid, oligopeptide, glycine betaine, sugar, teichoic acid transporter, or preprotein translocase subunit YidC) or chaperons, e.g. phage terminases, hem/copper-type cytochrome/quinol oxidase, pyruvate-formate-lyase-activating enzyme, protein-disulfide isomerase, or peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase (PrsA) [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It was, therefore, not surprising that the <italic>lgt</italic> mutation not only affected high-affinity metal ion uptake but mutants were also attenuated in virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Highly pathogenic and, in particular, epidemic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains bear various genomic islands in their genome that encode prophages, toxins and antibiotic resistance genes, e.g. SCCmec, or tandem paralogous genes such as those encoded in the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; island. The term &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; refers to non-phage and non-SCC genomic islands that are exclusively present in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and inserted at specific loci in the chromosome [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The genomic island termed &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; is present in all <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genomes sequenced to date [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but is not found in coagulase-negative species, including the non-pathogenic species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The genetic organization of &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; is highly conserved and is composed of two gene clusters: one cluster encodes a number of highly homologous exotoxin-encoding genes (<italic>set</italic>), the other one encodes lipoproteins, referred to as '<underline>l</underline>ipo<underline>p</underline>rotein-<underline>l</underline>ike' (<italic>lpl</italic>), with a typical lipo-box containing signal sequence [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The genetic organization of &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 is illustrated in <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. The <italic>set</italic> and <italic>lpl</italic> clusters are separated by the <italic>hsdM</italic> and <italic>hsdS</italic> genes that encode a restriction-modification system. While HsdS selects the genomic target sequence, HsdM is serves as a methylase. It has been proposed that this system contributes to stabilization and maintenance of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genomic islands. It was further suggested that the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; genomic islands originate from mobile genetic elements that were acquired independently through intra-species genetic transfer between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The finding that some &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; types contain a remnant transposase gene supports this hypothesis.

For the genetic maintenance of the tandem <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster it is currently believed that the highly conserved intragenic region flanked by the variable regions of the <italic>lpl</italic> genes is responsible for gene shuffling, tandem duplications and diversification [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, if &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; was not beneficial in infection we would expect it to get lost during evolution. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; tandem <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster in infection.</p><p>We chose <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as a model strain for several reasons: firstly it contains one of the most complex tandem lipoprotein clusters in the &#x003bd;SA&#x003b1; island, and, secondly, it is a member of the clonal complex (CC) 8 that encompasses several globally distributed epidemic lineages, including hospital-associated methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) and the highly prevalent community-associated MRSA clone USA300 [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the genetic basis for the high transmissibility and hypervirulence of the CC8 strains, and USA300 in particular, is unknown. Here, we reasoned that the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; island could represent a virulence determinant of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. After some difficulties we managed to construct a marker-less deletion mutant of the 10 kb <italic>lpl</italic> cluster. The mutant showed no apparent growth defect in both B-medium (rich medium) and DMEM/F (nutrient-poor medium) indicating that the tandem lipoproteins have no vital role <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, they might contribute to innate immune response.</p><p>It is well known that lipoproteins and lipopeptides are recognized by TLR2 [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which can form heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6 to trigger intracellular signaling by triacylated and diacylated lipopeptides, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> lipoproteins do not only contribute to ion uptake and pathogenicity, they also represent the predominant immune stimulators [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, we first addressed whether and to which extent the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster contributes to innate immune stimulation. Searching the annotated proteins of USA300 by the DOLOP program there are approximately 63 proposed lipoproteins present including the 10 Lpl proteins of the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; island. The 10 Lpl proteins comprise 16% of all lipoproteins in USA300. Theoretically, one would expect only a minor effect on induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in Mono Mac 6 cells. However, we observed in USA300&#x00394;<italic>lpl</italic> a 3-fold decrease in TNF-&#x003b1; and an almost 2-fold decrease in IL-6 expression (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). The complemented strain USA300<italic>lpl</italic> (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>) largely reached parental expression levels even in the absence of xylose, while in the presence of xylose TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 expression exceeded that of the parental strain by a factor of 2 and 4, respectively (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). These results show that despite the presence of other lipoproteins Lpl proteins have an unexpectedly high impact on innate immune stimulation. Notably, heterologous expression of pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic> in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> HG003 caused a similarly high induction of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 expression as with USA300 (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>).</p><p>Of note, in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> the induction of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 expression was not as pronounced. However, the non-pathogenic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> was exceptional in so far, as it triggered an almost 20-fold higher TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 expression than the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> belongs to the non-pathogenic staphylococcal species and we assume that generally the non-pathogenic species are non-pathogenic not only because of low to absent toxin and adhesion production but also because of their better recognition by our immune system [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, we also observed a comparable difference in stimulation with the synthetic lipopeptides: P2C was much more active than P3C (<xref rid="ppat.1004984.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>).</p><p>Since in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> lipidation of the lipoproteins by diacylglyceryl transferase (encoded by the <italic>lgt</italic> gene) is crucial for innate immune activation [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we wondered whether innate immune stimulation is preserved after cloning of the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster into an <italic>lgt</italic> deletion mutant. As shown in Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref> there was a roughly 2-fold increase in TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 expression in SA113<italic>lgt</italic> (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>) compared to SA113<italic>lgt</italic>. Although SA113<italic>lgt</italic> (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>) did not reach the SA113 parental level, we wondered why there was an increase at all. The most likely explanation is release of other PAMPs as a stress-response due to the <italic>lgt</italic> mutation. In this mutant all pro-lipoproteins are unlipidated but they are still transiently anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by the unprocessed signal peptide. Taking into consideration that in SA113<italic>lgt</italic> (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>) ten additional lipoproteins are highly expressed and cannot be correctly targeted via their lipid moiety to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, the membrane translocation machinery might be crammed, which could result in release of peptidoglycan and/or DNA that could contribute to the observed innate immune stimulation. Membrane jamming has frequently been observed when proteins were overexpressed and not correctly targeted. For example, upon overproduction of &#x003b2;-galactosidase hybrid proteins, the export pathway is so severely jammed that other exported proteins accumulate in their precursor form in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The other thrilling but unlikely possibility would have been that unlipidated Lpls caused immune stimulation. To clarify the situation we purified his-tagged Lpl1, as a Lpl representative lipoprotein, with and without its lipid part by expressing it with and without its lipo signal sequence (<xref rid="ppat.1004984.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Although applied in high concentration, the unlipidated protein Lpl1 showed no immune stimulating activity, suggesting that the increased immune stimulating activity in SA113<italic>lgt</italic> (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>) is probably due to a side effect, possibly, by higher release of peptidoglycan fragments, DNA or RNA that also contribute to innate immune stimulation [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Lastly, Lpl-mediated invasive activity might facilitate uptake and cytosolic sensing of these bacterial compounds.</p><p>The enhanced innate immune stimulation exerted by the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster in USA300 is not really beneficial in regards to virulence; on the contrary, these strains are better recognized by the innate immune system. Therefore, the key question was whether expression of the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; tandem <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster could represent an advantage in infection. It turned out that the most beneficial function of the Lpl was increased invasiveness. Invasion studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004984.g007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>) revealed that the mutant USA300&#x00394;<italic>lpl</italic> was significantly less invasive (&#x0003e;2-fold) than the parental strain, and that the complemented mutant showed an even higher invasiveness than the parental strain. The ability of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to be internalized by host cells is considered to be one of the most critical pathogenicity factors in persisting and relapsing infections because intracellular localization of bacteria evades antimicrobials and the host immune response [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is now widely accepted that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is internalized by a variety of non-professional phagocytes, such as endothelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], epithelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], fibroblasts [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], or osteoblasts [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and can persist inside the host cells for weeks, months or even years. The fibronectin binding proteins (FnBPA and FnBPB) are the major adhesins involved in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> internalization by host cells. They use fibronectin as a bridging molecule and the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin as host cell receptor resulting in signal transduction, tyrosine kinase activity, and cytoskeletal rearrangements [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The FnBPs also bind to the heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), which might act as a co-receptor in the FnBP-mediated uptake of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, a role of the extracellular adherence protein (Eap) was described in internalization into fibroblasts or epithelial cells; the receptor is unknown to date [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently, the major autolysin of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>epidermidis</italic> Atl was found to contribute to host cell internalization by interacting with the heat shock cognate protein Hsc70 [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>A very important confirmation of the invasive activity of the Lpls was the finding that the non-pathogenic and non-invasive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> strain becomes invasive when transformed with (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>) (<xref rid="ppat.1004984.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Although the frequency of invasion of S. <italic>carnosus</italic> (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>) was low, e.g. only approximately 10% of that of USA300, one has to consider that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> lacks FnBPs as the major players of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> invasion and also Eap [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, we do not know whether Atl plays a role in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic>-mediated host cell invasion as its sequence and domain organization differs significantly from that of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, the invasive activity seen in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> probably reflects the impact of the Lpls.</p><p>In our studies we frequently used human keratinocytes because they represent the immune sentinels in the skin and as such they provide a first line of defense against microbial pathogens. They express almost all TLRs, which is crucial for promoting skin immune responses to adherent bacteria. Activation of these receptors on human keratinocytes leads to a predominant TH1-type immune response and to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, keratinocytes also constitutively secrete, or are induced to release, numerous cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and TNF-&#x003b1;; and they process and release IL-1&#x003b2; through activation of the inflammasome.</p><p>Increased invasive activity is an important advantage for persistence. In our opinion, this overrules the disadvantage of enhanced innate immune stimulation. It is well known that if a pathogen invades new tissues the host responds by eliciting immune responses in an effort to eliminate infection. Internalization into non-professional antigen-presenting cells such as keratinocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] most likely protects <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> from the immune response. It is, therefore, to expect that by contributing to host cell invasion the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster enhances <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>' virulence and particularly its persistence. Whether the enhanced host cell invasion also contributes to increased dissemination and epidemic spreading needs to be further investigated.</p><p>
<italic>Lpl</italic> gene clusters are found in most <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains; however, these clusters differ with respect to the number of the tandem <italic>lpl</italic> genes and the type of &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1;. For example, most members of the CC8 (USA300, Newman, A5948, A9754) have 10 <italic>lpl</italic> genes, while NCTC8325 has only three. Members of the CC5 lineage also have an average of 10 <italic>lpl</italic> genes. Both CC5 and CC8 are distinguished by type I &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1;, while CC1, CC30 and CC151 possess type II, III and IV, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1004984.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). In this study we chose USA300 as a model strain for <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster analysis. However, the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster in other <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains will most likely have a similar function in invasion. One of the questions which will be addressed in the future is whether the number of <italic>lpl</italic> repeats in &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1; is correlated with the invasion frequency. Probably, there is a fine-tuned balance between a stable maintenance of the repeats and their benefit in infection. We further performed electron microscopy to visualize potential differences in cell surface structures between USA300 and its &#x00394;<italic>lpl</italic> mutant. However, at first sight these images revealed no apparent differences in the morphology (<xref rid="ppat.1004984.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). This was not unexpected because the mutant expresses 50 other lipoproteins.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 and HG001 induced autophagy in a human tumor cell line, while <italic>S</italic>. <italic>carnosus</italic> did not [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells become entrapped in vesicles and dividing <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells were seen intracellularly suggesting that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells are able to multiply intracellularly [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Whether the <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster is involved in this process is currently unknown. However, the ability of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to invade different types of non-professional phagocytes, to escape from the host lysosomal degradation machinery and to persist within the intracellular location most likely represent essential steps in pathogenesis. After invasion there are several options: <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells may be killed by the host cell, they kill the host cell, or they survive and persist by switching to an SCV (small colony variant) phenotype, an essential step for establishing chronic infections [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>What distinguishes an epidemic and disseminating strain from other strains is an important question. Not many cases are known where epidemic outbreaks could be traced to certain genes. One recent example is the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O104:H4 strain that caused the large German outbreak in 2011. This strain acquired genes from an entero-aggregative <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain (EAEC) that increased intestinal colonization thus turning it into a highly virulent and disseminating hybrid strain [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> the interaction between the bacterial surface molecules, the internalins InlA and InlB, and their cellular receptors E-cadherin and the Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (Met), respectively, triggers the recruitment of endocytic effectors, the subversion of the phosphoinositide metabolism, and the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton that leads to bacterial engulfment [<xref rid="ppat.1004984.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this pathogen the internalins are the basic virulence factors because they are a prerequisite for spreading and dissemination. It is, however, completely unknown how the Lpl proteins trigger invasion.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is one of the first studies addressing the role of the &#x003bd;Sa&#x003b1;-encoded tandem <italic>lpl</italic> gene cluster in a member of the high transmissible and hypervirulent clonal complex CC8.

On the one hand, increased activation of the innate immune system is not really beneficial for a pathogen because it activates bacterial immune defense. On the other hand, however, it is highly beneficial for a first-class pathogen to acquire an enhanced ability to invade host cells, which may facilitate spreading in the host.
