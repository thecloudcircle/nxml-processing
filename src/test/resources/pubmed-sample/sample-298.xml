Introduction</title><p>&#x003b2;- Thalassemia major is a congenital disease that is characterized by severe anemia. It depends on regular blood transfusion in early life stage. The disorder is more prevalent in Asia particularly in Mediterranean countries (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Flint, Harding, Boyce, &#x00026; Clegg, 1998</xref>). In major &#x003b2;-Thalassemia hemoglobin precipitation occurs and consequently induces reactive iron and free radicals in blood circulation. Iron overload may occur due to regular blood transfusions and high intestinal iron absorption (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Milena, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In human body iron excretion mostly has one directional cycle, thereby no repelling by excretory system. Consequently, iron excess gets deposited and disturbs many physiological functions in heart, liver, brain, spleen and endocrine systems (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Taher, Isma&#x02019;eel, &#x00026; Cappellini, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Rund &#x00026; Rachmilewitz, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Loukopoulos, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Nowadays, synthetic iron chelators are used for iron excretion in iron overload state. Chelators are small molecules that form a powerful complex with metal ions in organisms so they are called iron binders in literatures. Iron chelation is recommended after 10-20 blood transfusion practices or when amount of serum ferritin gets more than 1000 mg/ml (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Thalassemia International Federation, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Iron chelating method is a useful assay for estimation of plant chelating potential. Chelating activity of medicinal plants mostly depend on its phytochemical constituents especially phenolic substances (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Deferoxamine is a synthetic iron chelating drug used to prevent the increase of iron concentration in plasma. Excessive use of deferoxamine by injection route has limited the drug application in clinics. Moreover, its short life span has restricted its efficiency in practice (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Borgna-Pignatti &#x00026; Galanello, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Yasser et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Deferiprone is another iron chelator which is used in iron overload treatment. It is also applicable for treatment of myocardial siderosis in iron toxicity. Its long timed application causes a reduction in white blood cell count mainly neutrophils.</p><p>Currently, there is no effective drug without side effects for the treatment of iron excess in thalassemia and other iron storage diseases, except chelation therapy, which is the only method for iron excretion. Thus, scientists are more focused on medicinal plants rich in phytochemical compounds for the removal of ironin thalassemia.</p><p><italic>Medicago sativais</italic> (family:Fabaceae) which its sprouts are often consumed as salad vegetable.

Discussion</title><p>Plants with medicinal capacity have always been an important target for drug development. It is important that the <italic>M. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. porrum</italic> extracts produced a significant dose dependent on chelating potential incomparison to control. The present result indicated that <italic>M. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. porrum</italic> at the dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg reduced the iron and ferritin concentrations. Iron and ferritin levels were significantly increased after injection of iron dextran in 28 days. This expected results supported the iron overloading process in present study.</p><p>Medicinal plants are rich sources of natural phytochemicals with antioxidant activity that are mainly associated with phenolic compounds (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Piett, 2000</xref>). Generally, plant extracts with high levels of phenolic compounds revealed a good iron chelating activity; therefore such kind of herbal extracts can be used as a choice of chelator for treatment of thalassemia in future (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ebrahimzadeh et al., 2008d</xref>). In present study there was a direct correlation with iron chelating and antioxidant activity and phenol contents.</p><p>Iron at normal range is necessary for the metabolic pathways in body. However, in major &#x003b2;-thalassemia which is the best case of iron overload, reactive oxygen species are mostly formed by deposition of iron excess in vital organs. They usually used DF as an iron chelator for removal of iron excess (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Milena, 2010</xref>). At the present study <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> and <italic>Allium porrum</italic> as iron chelators significantly decreased iron in animal groups by forming soluble and stable forms by interactions with flavonoids after incubation (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Mira et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Iron concentration was significantly reduced in experimental groups compared to control serums P&#x0003c;0.001. Chelating potential of the extractsmay be related to a number of possible mechanisms. Experimental studies have shown thatphytochemical content and antioxidant activity isassociated withchelating property (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Mira et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>It also has been reported that flavonoids in plant extracts can interact with iron in live organisms (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Mira et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it may be suggested that chelating property of the hydro &#x02013; alcoholic extract of <italic>M. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. porrum</italic> might be due to the presence of flavonoid substances. In the recent work a significant reduction was reported in serum iron and ferritin rate, by <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> and <italic>Allium porrum</italic> extracts respectively P&#x0003c;0.001.<italic>Medicago sativa</italic> extract showed more potential but had no significant effect on iron and ferritin concentration in experimental group compared to <italic>Allium porrum</italic> extract p&#x0003c;0.05. This difference could be due to antioxidant potential and phytochemical contents.</p><p>Iron overload is the main cause of mortality in major &#x003b2;-thalassemia because it disturbs function of vital organs such as heart and brain. Thus, removal of iron is essential for their quality of life. In present paper <italic>M. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. Porrum</italic> extracts were optimal chelator for iron reductin at in vivo state. <italic>M. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. Porrum</italic> were effective plant chelators to reduce the iron in an iron overload model.</p><p>Present result confirmed that <italic>M. sativa</italic> with the dose of 400 mg/kg was potentially more protective than <italic>A. porrum</italic> against iron overload. This results need to be confirmed in serial experimental researches with different concentration of iron overload. The data obtained in recent study indicated that <italic>M. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. porrum</italic> demonstrate an iron chelation effect in reducing the serum iron level. Iron chelators can bind with ion metals such as calcium and magnisum which are vital ions for live organisms. The prolong use of plant chelators with high concentration may decrease calcium and magnisum levels. A new project or identify of calcium and magnisum concentration is essential.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In this study protective effect of <italic>M.
