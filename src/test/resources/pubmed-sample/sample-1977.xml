Many of the promising conversion pathways for these products are based on cascades of biochemical and/or catalytic reactions starting with the sugars derived from cellulose (glucose) and hemicelluloses (primarily xylose in angiosperms). The recalcitrance of plant cell walls to biological degradation, deconstruction, or conversion is considered to be the most crucial factor to overcome in order to develop successful bioprocessing technologies for lignocellulose conversion to renewable fuels and chemicals (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Himmel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). As such, in order to generate high sugar yields from the cellulose and hemicellulose within plant cell walls, pre-treatment is required in combination with the subsequent polysaccharide hydrolysis by either enzymes or an acid catalyst (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Wyman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The grasses or graminaceous monocots represent many important agricultural residues such as corn (maize) stover (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L. subsp. <italic>mays</italic>), wheat straw (<italic>Triticum</italic> spp.), rice straw (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.), and sugarcane bagasse (<italic>Saccharum</italic> spp.), as well as many promising perennial bioenergy feedstocks such as switchgrass (<italic>Panicum virgatum</italic> L.) and <italic>Miscanthus</italic> spp. (<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Vermerris, 2011</xref>). Outcomes of pre-treatment are obviously dependent on the combination of pre-treatment chemistry and the plant cell-wall properties. The cell walls of graminaceous monocots are known to contain alkali-labile ferulate ester cross-links within the hemicellulose and lignin (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Scalbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hatfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Iiyama and Lam, 2001</xref>), as well as high phenolic hydroxyl contents in their lignins, resulting in increased alkali solubility (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Lapierre <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>), with these properties rendering the cell wall highly susceptible to delignification by alkaline pre-treatments (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).

As an example, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Sarath <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> found that while cell-wall lignin content in diverse switchgrass lines was negatively correlated with hydrolysis yields following dilute acid pre-treatment, more than 50% of the variability could be attributed to differences in cell-wall architecture. The water retention value (WRV) has been used in our recent work as a predictor of enzymatic hydrolysis yields for corn stover and switchgrass subjected to alkali, alkaline oxidative, and liquid hot water pre-treatments (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Hodge, 2014</xref>), and is proposed to act as an indirect measurement of a number of cell-wall properties (e.g. overall hydrophilicity, porosity, and polysaccharide accessibility) that are manifested in the cell wall&#x02019;s ability to swell in water. This measurement may be able to incorporate structural differences between different cell-wall types such as the highly hygroscopic and digestible pith parenchyma cell walls versus the more hydrophobic and less-digestible cell walls within vascular bundles and the epidermis.</p><p content-type="indent">There is substantially less published literature on the correlation between plant cell-wall properties and their response to pre-treatment and hydrolysis. Recently, approaches for high-throughput screening of pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis have been developed for the purpose of screening large sets of cell-wall material for the purpose of identifying potential reduced recalcitrance phenotypes both with and without a pre-treatment (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Decker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Santoro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Understanding the cell-wall traits associated with reduced recalcitrance phenotypes or phenotypes that exhibit specific responses to pre-treatment are an important component of screening. However, typically only composition analysis is performed across the sample sets, limiting the understanding of the cell-wall properties, traits, or phenotypes that are also associated with the cell wall&#x02019;s response to enzymatic hydrolysis. Notably, recent work has employed high-throughput screening of panels of promising bioenergy grasses that include diverse cultivars of wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Lindedam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), <italic>Miscanthus</italic> spp. (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and maize (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Penning <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) subjected to hydrothermal pre-treatment, and a sorghum [<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) Moench] diversity panel subjected to aqueous ammonia pre-treatment (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbrink <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Importantly, from these cited studies, while they were able to identify substantial differences in cell-wall responses to pre-treatment, it was difficult to draw conclusions about the cell-wall properties, traits, or phenotypes that are also associated with improved hydrolysis yields or sugar release following pre-treatment. Relative to other high-throughput screening studies of poplar, where lignin content as well as the S/G ratio could be clearly be identified as a strong contributor to hydrolysis yields following pre-treatment (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Studer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), lignin was not correlated with hydrolysis yields in these studies, indicating that other unquantified cell-wall properties may be responsible for the observed variability in the data sets.</p><p content-type="indent">While at least one study has investigated the alteration of cell-wall properties and <italic>in vitro</italic> digestibility in a diverse set of orchard grass (<italic>Dactylis glomerata</italic> L.) subjected to acid chlorite delignification (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Darcy and Belyea, 1980</xref>), there is scant literature on the relationship between plant cell-wall properties and hydrolysis yields for diverse maize lines subjected to delignifying pre-treatments such as mild NaOH pre-treatment. Thus, the goal of this work was to understand better how maize cell-wall properties impact initial recalcitrance as well as NaOH pre-treatment. Specifically, for this work 12 cell-wall properties were selected that may influence overall cell-wall recalcitrance including WRV, xylan and lignin contents before and after pre-treatment, initial cell-wall acetate content, <italic>p</italic>CA and FA content before pre-treatment, solubilized <italic>p</italic>CA and FA during pre-treatment, and the S/G ratio of the lignin in the untreated cell-wall. These properties were quantified for a diversity panel of 26 maize lines that were previously identified as exhibiting substantial phenotypic diversity in glucose release following mild NaOH pre-treatment (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Muttoni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). These were subjected to mild NaOH pre-treatment and the glucose yields determined for the different lines before and after the pre-treatment.

The acetate results can be interpreted as potentially relating to the lignin release. While it may be expected that high-acetate contents would consume more alkali and presumably hinder lignin removal, the opposite is the case. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, the initial cell-wall acetate content was positively correlated to initial lignin contents and negatively correlated to final lignin content, indicating that high-acetate cell walls are likely to be more recalcitrant yet respond better to alkaline pre-treatment with respect to lignin removal. Additionally, it was observed that initial <italic>p</italic>CA content and <italic>p</italic>CA released were positively correlated with initial acetate content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This may be a consequence of the correlation of between acetate and lignin since <italic>p</italic>CA is known to be acylated to syringyl lignins and may only represent the correlation to lignin content (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Allen, 1995</xref>). The correlation to final xylan content may be a consequence of high acetate corresponding to higher lignin removal, which would enrich the xylan content of the pre-treated biomass. Overall, it is not clear whether this cluster of co-varying properties is an indication of differences in the &#x02018;average&#x02019; cell-wall property or whether these may indicate differences in the abundance of, for example, high-lignin, high-<italic>p</italic>CA, and high-acetate tissues. Recently, work has been targeted at altering the expression of genes associated with <italic>O</italic>-acetylation as a strategy for altering cell-wall recalcitrance (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), although it is currently not clear how only alteration in xylan <italic>O</italic>-acetylation will impact cell-wall recalcitrance.</p><p content-type="indent">Interestingly, WRVs did not show a significant correlation with any of the cell-wall biopolymer content (i.e. lignin and xylan) while it did exhibit significant correlations (albeit weak) with substitutions on these biopolymers (i.e. <italic>p</italic>CA and acetate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Specifically, the initial cell-wall <italic>p</italic>CA content was inversely correlated to the initial WRV, which may provide evidence that highly <italic>p</italic>-coumaroylated cell walls may be more hydrophobic (and higher in lignin content), potentially imparting increased recalcitrance to degradation by microbial pathogens or rumen microbiota. The (weak) negative correlation between initial cell-wall acetate content and initial WRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) could potentially be due to increasing hydrophobicity of exposed xylans (i.e. the glycan will have an exposed ethyl group rather than a hydroxyl group). However, the hypothesis that highly acetylated cell walls are more porous due to a decreased level of H-bonding between xylans and cellulose does not fit this data since increasing acetyl content corresponded to decreasing WRVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). As initial lignin content was positivity correlated with the cell-wall acetate content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), the decreasing initial WRV with increasing acetate could be a consequence of the increasing lignin content decreasing the cell-wall&#x02019;s capacity to absorb water.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Correlations between cell-wall properties and hydrolysis yields</title><p>Besides between-property correlations, correlations between cell-wall properties and hydrolysis yields are important for understanding property contributions to cell-wall recalcitrance.

The first is the identification that WRV was positively correlated with the untreated 6h hydrolysis yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). As discussed in the introduction, WRV was included as a parameter that may offer the potential for consolidating a number of other, unquantified cell-wall properties that may be able to be correlated with hydrolysis yields. Our previous work used only two types of biomass (corn stover and switchgrass) subjected to varying levels of delignification by alkaline oxidative pre-treatment and found strong correlations between WRV and hydrolysis yields (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Hodge, 2014</xref>). The current work used a wide range of (similar) biomass that was subjected to a single pre-treatment condition, which may explain why WRVs following pre-treatment were not able to predict differences in hydrolysis yields following pre-treatment.</p><p content-type="indent">The initial cell-wall acetate content demonstrated a negative correlation with the untreated 6h hydrolysis yield although not with the pre-treated 72h yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). As discussed previously, the acetate content is strongly correlated to many other properties and potentially this cluster of related properties may be able to explain differences in hydrolysis yields rather than a single property. For example, initial acetate content was strongly correlated with initial lignin content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), which may be the property most strongly responsible for the response in hydrolysis yields. Previously, non-linear models have been developed relating decreases in acetate and lignin to increases in hydrolysis yields for lime-pre-treated corn stover (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Holtzapple, 2006</xref>) and hybrid poplar (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Dwyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), although these correlated simultaneous acetate and lignin removal by alkali with improved hydrolysis yields rather than initial variability in these properties, as was done in the present work.</p><p content-type="indent">Lignin is thought to impact saccharification yields by physical occlusion of polysaccharides (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brunecky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), providing resistance to swelling (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neil and York, 2003</xref>), and by non-specific binding to cellulases (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Palonen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).

As expected, the untreated lignin content was negatively correlated with the untreated 6h hydrolysis yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and the lignin content following pre-treatment was negatively correlated with the pre-treated 72h hydrolysis yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, the lignin contents prior to and following pre-treatment did not correlatedwith each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that lignin removal for mild NaOH pre-treatment is not necessarily dependent on the initial lignin content but is dependent on many other cell-wall properties. This is significant in that many strategies for reduced cell-wall recalcitrance have targeted lignin levels (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Simmons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), although it may be sufficient that the lignin is easily removable by the pre-treatment to decrease the final cell-wall recalcitrance rather than the initial cell-wall recalcitrance.</p><p content-type="indent">As we have already identified in this work, the lignin removal is more important than the initial lignin content for mild NaOH pre-treatment and consequently, lignin properties that may contribute to improved lignin removal are important. Another interesting lignin-related finding was that the initial S/G ratio was positively correlated with the untreated 6h hydrolysis yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), while the trend apparently reversed for the pre-treated hydrolysis yield (although this was not a statistically significant correlation). The correlation between S/G ratio in untreated biomass and <italic>in vitro</italic> ruminant digestibility for grasses has been somewhat contradictory in the literature (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;chin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) although a general trend is that an increasing S/G ratio may be linked to increasing digestibility.</p><p content-type="indent">The initial xylan content was found to be negatively correlated with the untreated 6h hydrolysis yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F</xref>). The fact that both initial lignin and xylan were negatively correlated with the untreated hydrolysis yields yet these two properties were uncorrelated with each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) may indicate that both of these components play an important role in the limited access of cellulolytic enzymes to cellulose. The enzyme cocktail utilized for this study was not supplemented with xylanase, which may be a factor contributing to this result.</p><p content-type="indent">Ferulate and diferulate esters are known to be attached to the primary hydroxyl at the C5 position of &#x003b1;-<sc>l</sc>-arabinofuranosyl residues in xylans and be involved in cross-linking of xylans to lignin by incorporation of the aromatic moiety through ether linkages into growing lignin polymers or by cross-coupling (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hatfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). This cross-linking of cell-wall polymers by ferulates is generally accepted to play an important role in cell-wall recalcitrance (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Grabber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).

However, while strong, statistically significant negative correlations were identified between etherified ferulates and <italic>in vitro</italic> digestibility, esterified ferulate content was found to be positively correlated with <italic>in vitro</italic> digestibility in smooth bromegrass (<italic>Bromus inermis</italic> Leyss subsp. inermis), cocksfoot (<italic>D. glomerata</italic> L.), and reed canary grass (<italic>Phalaris arundinacea</italic> L.)

The present work did not distinguish between etherified and esterified ferulates, although the method for ferulate content was performed under harsh enough conditions that this term probably comprises both etherified and esterifed as increasing the alkali loading and temperature during saponification did not result in additional ferulate release (data not shown). The ferulate release during pre-treatment may be more representative of esterified ferulate due to the mild conditions utilized for pre-treatment. Nonetheless, ferulate content and the ferulate released were found to be strongly positively correlated to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and, importantly, the ferulate released showed a strong correlation with the 72h hydrolysis yields following NaOH pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>), although not with any of the other hydrolysis conditions. This can be understood, as cell walls that are highly cross-linked are more susceptible to alkaline pre-treatment. Recently, incorporation of ferulate esters into hybrid poplar has been validated as a strategy to improve enzymatic hydrolysis following an alkaline pre-treatment (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Wilkerson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Lignin content, <italic>p</italic>CA content, and the S/G ratio in maize stem internodes and rinds have been shown to increase with increasing maturity, while ferulate content does not change (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Morrison <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). The simultaneous increase in these properties has been implicated in the decrease in maize digestibility with increasing maturity (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Grabber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Casler, 2006</xref>).

These results were notable in that the correlation was the opposite for untreated biomass compared with NaOH-pre-treated biomass, whereby increasing release or content of <italic>p</italic>CA corresponded to decreasing hydrolysis yields for untreated cell walls and increasing hydrolysis yields for pre-treated cell walls. High <italic>p</italic>CA content in untreated maize has been correlated with low <italic>in vitro</italic> digestibility (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;chin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), although the finding that high initial <italic>p</italic>-coumarylation of lignin may be related to high hydrolysis yields following pre-treatment is novel. As discussed previously, the <italic>p</italic>CA content was positively correlated with the initial lignin content, so this could be an indirect measure of the impact of lignin content. As another alternative, <italic>p</italic>CA-containing lignins may be responsible for the uptake and inactivation of cellulolytic enzymes, as is known to occur for polyphenolic compounds such as tannins and lignins and phenolic acid monomers (<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Ximenes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Understanding the relationship between cell-wall recalcitrance and pre-treatment is important in that this may lead to the identification of strategies for plant breeding or genetic engineering that may improve cell-wall deconstruction. For this study, 26 diverse maize lines were subjected to mild NaOH pre-treatment and a broad set of properties relating to cell-wall recalcitrance were characterized. By combining cell-wall structural characterization and enzymatic hydrolysis of cell-wall polysaccharides both prior to and following mild NaOH pre-treatment, a number of expected as well as non-intuitive results were identified. The hydrolysis yields of non-pre-treated cell walls were found to be positively correlated with WRV and S/G ratio and negatively correlated with xylan and acetate content. While the initial cell-wall xylan and acetate content were uncorrelated with each other, the acetate content was found to exhibit a number of strong correlations with other cell-wall properties. The pre-treated cell-wall hydrolysis yields were positively correlated with the ferulate released by pre-treatment, indicating that breaking of ferulate cross-links between cell-wall polymers is an important outcome of pre-treatment. As expected, statistically significant negative correlations were identified between the cell-wall lignin content and the hydrolysis yields for both untreated (<italic>R</italic>=&#x02013;0.40, <italic>P</italic>=0.037) and NaOH-pre-treated maize (R=&#x02013;0.50, <italic>P</italic>=0.009). It has long been known that cell-wall lignin content can be negatively correlated with enzymatic hydrolysis yields and <italic>in vitro</italic> digestibility, as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> digestibility in ruminants. However, the data demonstrated that the initial cell-wall lignin content and the pre-treated cell-wall content were not correlated with each other, that initial cell-wall lignin content was not correlated with hydrolysis yields following pre-treatment, and the cell-wall lignin content following pre-treatment was not correlated with untreated hydrolysis yields. This important finding indicates that, while enzymatic hydrolysis yields may be set by the cell-wall lignin content, the cell wall&#x02019;s response to delignifying pre-treatment such as mild NaOH pre-treatment is not necessarily set by the initial lignin content. The <italic>p</italic>CA that was saponifiable by mild NaOH pre-treatment showed a negative correlation with the hydrolysis yields of untreated maize (<italic>R</italic>=&#x02013;0.61, <italic>P</italic>=0.001) and the inverse response for pre-treated maize (<italic>R</italic>=0.40, <italic>P</italic>=0.044), indicating that cell walls with a high content of saponifiable <italic>p</italic>CA are more recalcitrant without treatment, yet respond better to pre-treatment than cell walls with a low content of saponifiable <italic>p</italic>CA. Importantly, this indicates that properties contributing to a &#x02018;reduced recalcitrance&#x02019; phenotype following a specific pre-treatment are not necessarily the same properties that contribute to recalcitrance in untreated cell walls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s14"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
