According to the results of IHC, the viral antigen was consistently detected in lymphocytes of bone marrow and spleen and less frequently in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer&#x02019;s patches. Despite the antigen detection in BALT and mesenteric lymph nodes, histopathological lesions were not observed in these tissues. Lympholysis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, and increased numbers of megakaryocytes were seen in Peyer&#x02019;s patches, spleens, and bone marrow, respectively.

BVDV, a member of the <italic>Pestivirus</italic> genus in the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, is divided into two species, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, on the basis of antigenic and genetic differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Both species consist of two biotypes, cytopathic (cp) and noncytopathic (ncp), on the basis of their ability to cause changes in the appearance of the cytoplasm of infected cells. BVDV is known to acutely infect immunocompetent animals, results in a mild subclinical to severe, even fatal, systemic clinical disease that can lead to reproductive problems such as embryonic death, abortions, and still births if pregnant cows are infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The most important source for direct and indirect transmission of BVDV is driven by persistently infected (PI) animals that were infected in utero<italic>,</italic> and these PI animals shed virus continuously throughout their lifespan.</p><p id="Par17">BVDV can infect a wide range of hosts, including cattle, sheep, swine, goats, and wild ungulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Antibodies against BVDV have been detected in wild and domesticated ruminants and porcine species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent studies conducted by our group showed that mice can be infected with BVDV-1 via the oral route; however, shedding of the virus by mice was not detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, hematological changes, histopathology, and viral antigen distributions were quite different between cp BVDV-1- and ncp BVDV-1-inoculated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">In cattle, ncp BVDV-2 infection may cause more severe clinical signs, as well as decreases in the numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes as compared to ncp BVDV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The outcomes of BVDV infection can differ depending on the BVDV species used. Little information is currently available regarding the association between pathology and specific genotypes of BVDV in a murine model. Our previous study evaluated platelet counts, histopathological lesions, and the presence of a viral antigen in mice during acute infection with ncp BVDV-1, and these results were similar to those observed in cattle. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the clinical signs, hematological changes, histopathological lesions in lymphoid tissues, and the distribution of the viral antigen after oral inoculation with a Korean ncp BVDV-2 field isolate in mice, and to compare these results with the virus distribution and histopathological findings in ncp BVDV-1 infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>BVDV culture and mouse infections</title><p id="Par19">Specific pathogen-free BALB/c mice (6&#x02212;8 weeks old) were purchased from Central Laboratory Animal, Inc.

On receipt, MDBK cells were tested by PCR for mycoplasma contamination (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) and were found to be free of mycoplasma. This virus strain was obtained after 5&#x000a0;days of culture, one freeze-thaw cycle, and centrifugation at 1900 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min to remove large cellular debris. The supernatant was then frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in aliquots until inoculation into mice. The virus was titrated in MDBK cell cultures, and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) was calculated.</p><p id="Par21">Twenty-four mice were assigned to the ncp BVDV-2 infection group, and six mice were used in the mock infection group; 30 mice were subjected to each experiment.

No histological lesions were seen in mock-infected mice. Although viral antigen was detected in mesenteric lymph nodes, no pathological changes were observed in this tissue. Ncp BVDV-2-infected mice generally showed mild histopathological changes (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The histopathological lesions found in Peyer&#x02019;s patches were a result of lympholysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Mild lympholysis was consistently seen in high-dose-inoculated mice from day 2 pi through day 9 pi, whereas this lesion was not observed in low-dose-inoculated mice on day 2 pi but became apparent by day 9. In the spleen, lympholysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>; blue arrow) and infiltration by inflammatory cells (mostly monocytes; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>; black arrow) were evident in low- and high-dose-inoculated mice until days 9 pi.

Moreover, in ncp BVDV-2-inoculated mice, histopathological lesions such as lympholysis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, and a significant increase in megakaryocyte numbers were observed in Peyer&#x02019;s patches, spleen, and bone marrow, respectively. These effects were more prominent in high-dose-inoculated mice. The present results show the establishment of ncp BVDV-2 infection in mice although thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, detection of the viral antigen in various tissues, and the development of tissue lesions (as observed in cattle and ncp BVDV-1-infected mice) were less frequently seen in this study. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of ncp BVDV-2 infection in mice.</p><p id="Par32">We found that ncp BVDV-2-inoculated mice did not develop any clinical signs, such as ruffled fur, reduced activity, crouching, and reluctance to move, until the end of the experiment, and no weight loss was observed in these mice. This finding is different from what is seen in mice infected with ncp BVDV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our recent study showed no clinical manifestations in mice orally inoculated with ncp BVDV-1 although ncp BVDV-1-inoculated mice lost weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is difficult to explain why weight loss did not occur in mice infected with ncp BVDV-2 here. This phenomenon is probably associated with the limited ability of this virus to cause the infection.</p><p id="Par33">Thrombocytopenia is a frequent effect of a viral infection, and viruses follow a variety of distinct strategies to decrease the numbers of circulating platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Ncp BVDV-2 infection in mice here led to thrombocytopenia at the beginning of infection. This result is clearly different from that of ncp BVDV-1 infection, in which significant thrombocytopenia takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; on the other hand, our present findings are similar to characteristics of cp BVDV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, the reason why thrombocytopenia was observed only at an early time point (day 2) is not clear; however, thrombocytopenia seems to be associated with virulence of the virus species. Virulent ncp BVDV-2 infection has been shown consistently to induce thrombocytopenia in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Several studies have documented the outcomes of infections with different strains of BVDV in cattle, with clinical and necropsy results indicating different severity levels of infection, depending on virulence of the virus species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, the transient thrombocytopenia observed in ncp BVDV-2-inoculated mice here suggests that the virus used in this study may be considered a low virulence species and that the consequent dissemination of this virus throughout the body may be restricted in ncp BVDV-2-infected mice.</p><p id="Par34">The hematological hallmark of BVDV infection is leukopenia, primarily lymphopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the present study, lymphopenia was not observed in all ncp BVDV-2-infected mice throughout this experiment; however, a significant reduction in leukocytes was found in low-dose-inoculated animals on day 2. Our previous study of ncp BVDV-1-infected mice has revealed lymphopenia in low-lose-inoculated mice at early time points and in high- dose-inoculated animals on day 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A decrease in leukocyte counts was not observed in all ncp BVDV-1-infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but in ncp BVDV-2-infected animals, the numbers of circulating leukocytes were diminished. Unlike in ncp BVDV-1 infections, the numbers of other leukocytes did not increase in ncp BVDV-2-infected mice. We can speculate that the pathogenesis may be different between ncp BVDV-1 and ncp BVDV-2 infections in mice. Ridpath has reported that virulent BVDV-2 induces leukopenia and lymphopenia, whereas avirulent BVDV-2 decreases leukocyte numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The reduction in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts was more frequently observed in low-dose- than in high-dose-inoculated mice in the present study although the difference in these counts was not statistically significant. These results suggest that the outcome of ncp BVDV-2 infection in mice is probably affected by the dose effect, resulting in the limited ability of ncp BVDV-2 to circulate in blood.</p><p id="Par35">The viral antigen was consistently detected in lymphocytes of the spleen and bone marrow in all ncp BVDV-2-infected mice. Contrary to what was observed in ncp BVDV-1 infections, viral antigen was found in bone marrow and, less frequently, in mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer&#x02019;s patches, and BALT of ncp BVDV-2-infected mice. The viral antigens were found to be distributed evenly among these tissues, regardless of the virus dose (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, the viral antigen was present for a limited time in mesenteric lymph nodes without induction of histopathological changes. Clearance of the virus from mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer&#x02019;s patches, and BALT was observed on day 5 pi. These data are quite different from those obtained in ncp BVDV-1 infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A previous study conducted by our group suggests that the viral antigen is present less frequently in the lymphoid tissues of mice injected intraperitoneally with ncp BVDV-2 when compared with ncp BVDV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], indicating that ncp BVDV-2 is much more restricted in its ability to spread and replicate in lymphoid tissues than ncp BVDV-1 is. Our findings suggest that the differences in antigen detection are related to the virulence of a virus species. Additionally, according to the results of RT-PCR, the spleen is the preferred target tissue for BVDV detection in ncp BVDV-2-infected mice.</p><p id="Par36">A correlation between the distribution of the viral antigen and histopathological lesions was not apparent in this study. Although the viral antigen was less often detected in Peyer&#x02019;s patches, lympholysis was observed there throughout the experiment. Unlike what was observed in ncp BVDV-1 infections, lymphoid depletion was not found in the mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer&#x02019;s patches of all ncp BVDV-2-infected mice. This result can be explained by rapid virus clearance, which prevented further spread throughout lymphoid tissues. Our findings suggest that ncp BVDV-2 infection does not cause lymphopenia in mice. As in ncp BVDV-1-infected mice, lymphoid depletion in the spleen was not observed in ncp BVDV-2-infected mice, but lympholysis in the spleen was observed. In addition, infiltration by inflammatory cells, especially monocytes, was apparent in the spleen. This result is in agreement with the characteristics of ncp BVDV-1 infections, and these findings were frequent in high-dose-inoculated mice. The cause of the increased infiltration by inflammatory cells in mice infected with ncp BVDV was not resolved in this study. This pathological change is likely specific to the murine model, not to cattle. Therefore, this phenomenon in the spleen may be a result of the host immune response against ncp BVDV infection.</p><p id="Par37">In this study, the number of megakaryocytes increased significantly in bone marrow. Our previous studies have shown that cp BVDV-1 or ncp BVDV-1 infections in mice after oral inoculation result in a significant increase in the number of megakaryocytes in the spleen but not in bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The differences between these groups may be due to the virus species used. Consequently, our results indicate a significant increase in the number of megakaryocytes in BVDV-infected mice, irrespective of the virus species. The increase in megakaryocyte counts may be explained as compensation for an insufficient number of platelets under the influence of BVDV infection in mice. Despite the increases in megakaryocyte numbers, the viral antigen in the murine model was not detected by IHC in the megakaryocytes of bone marrow. In contrast to what was observed in mice here, a viral antigen in cattle was found in megakaryocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This observation implies that the pathogenesis of BVDV infection may differ between cattle and mice. Thus, cells in bone marrow in which a viral antigen has been detected may serve as an indicator to distinguish BVDV-infected hosts (mice and cattle). Our results imply that thrombocytopenia in mice and cattle may ultimately be mediated by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">Ncp BVDV-2 infection in mice after oral inoculation caused transient thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, limited viral antigen spread to lymphoid tissues, induced less severe histopathological lesions, and increased the number of megakaryocytes in bone marrow, in comparison with ncp BVDV-1-infected mice. In addition, ncp BVDV-2 infection in cattle has these distinctive features: lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphoid depletion in lymphatic organs, and distribution of the viral antigen among various tissues as well as the presence of the viral antigen in megakaryocytes, when compared to ncp BVDV-2-infected mice. These observations suggest that there are marked differences in pathogenesis according to host and virus species used for inoculation. In the present study, ncp BVDV-2 infection was established in mice despite the lack of hematological changes and histopathological lesions indicative of BVDV infection, which were relatively fewer than those in ncp BVDV-1. Overall, the ncp BVDV-1 infection in mice was more similar to cattle infection than to ncp BVDV-2 infection in mice in terms of the hematological and histological findings. We cannot be certain, but ncp BVDV-1 appears to be more suitable than ncp BVDV-2 for setting up a BVDV infection in a murine model. These data provide important information for understanding the differences in pathogenesis between BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 infections in mice. Further studies are therefore necessary to determine the biological significance of mice for BVDV infection.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BALT</term><def><p id="Par5">Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BVDV</term><def><p id="Par6">Bovine viral diarrhea virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cp</term><def><p id="Par7">Cytopathic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IHC</term><def><p id="Par8">Immunohistochemistry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDBK</term><def><p id="Par9">Madin-Darby bovine kidney</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MLN</term><def><p id="Par10">Mesenteric lymph node</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ncp</term><def><p id="Par11">Noncytopathic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par12">Persistent infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par13">Postinfection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par14">Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCID<sub>50</sub></term><def><p id="Par15">50% tissue culture infective dose</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We would like to thank Yu-Jung Han and Young-Je Kwon (Kyungpook National University, Korea) for helping with animal care.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="Par39">All procedures involving animals in this study were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Kyungpook National University Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par40">This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (No. 2015R1C1A2A01053080).</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par41">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KSC designed the study and drafted the manuscript.
