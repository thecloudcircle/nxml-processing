The cause of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease, is still unclear, and this condition is considered to be due to both environmental and genetic factors. Rheumatoid arthritis greatly affects the synovium of joints. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are similar to those of many other diseases and conditions, making it difficult to diagnose. If rheumatoid arthritis is not treated, then it results in destruction and disorganization of the joint (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Chronic disease will lead to conditions such as synovial hypertrophy and angiogenesis (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Rheumatoid arthritis can be detected using both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In addition, both of these modalities have the potential to depict the enhanced permeability of small vessels in the case of angiogenesis.</p><p>The pathological conditions observed in early rheumatoid arthritis include thickening of the synovium, bursae, and tendon sheaths. Joint effusion also occurs in the initial stage of rheumatoid arthritis and was found to be associated with bursitis, synovitis, and tenosynovitis. The next stage involves angiogenesis and vascularization of the synovium (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Radiographs have been used as traditional methods to diagnose and rule out rheumatoid arthritis. The common features observed using these techniques are marginal erosion, inflammation of the joint tissue, joint subluxation, loss of joint space and osteopenia (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), but such manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis can be observed only in the late stage of the disease. The early radiography findings of rheumatoid arthritis are synovitis and swelling of the soft tissue in the hands. Proliferative synovitis, which is associated with joints of the wrist, hand, ankle, and cervical spine, is responsible for the destruction of bones and cartilage (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Diagnostic ultrasound is a noninvasive technique used to image the inside of the body. MRI, a versatile radiology technique, makes use of magnetic fields to pictorially represent anatomical structures and the physiology of the body. Both MRI and ultrasound are highly sensitive techniques and are increasingly being used in clinical practice and research. MRI enables the detection of various conditions, including bone marrow edema. Bone marrow edema is responsible for bone erosion and inflammation. Bone edema is not visible with ultrasound imaging or computed tomography (CT). MRI has the potential to enable visualization in three orthogonal planes and provides details for both the affected bone and the surrounding area of the joints (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>MRI has the advantages of being able to evaluate peripheral joints in terms of articular and periarticular inflammation, cartilage damage, bone erosion and tendon tearing. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI can obtain qualitative, quantitative and semi-quantitative measurements. Additionally, it facilitates the estimation of inflammatory changes and complications of long-standing inflammation and provides a global, instead of local, view of bone, including the bone&#x02019;s internal structure and periarticular tissue. Ultrasonography is cost-effective. It allows for the evaluation of peripheral joints in cases of inflammation (ulnar nerve stability, luxation, and tendon tearing). Synovial hypertrophy and the degree of joint vascularization can be determined using ultrasonography.</p><p>Ultrasound is readily available at various centers, but it is not able to examine the internal structure of bone. Additionally, ultrasound cannot image bone edema, which can be visualized by only MRI. However, contrast-enhanced MRI has requires the administration of contrast agents, has motion artifacts, and has a low resolving power compared to ultrasound (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>MRI reveals synovitis as a thickening of the synovial membrane. Contrast-enhanced T1 images are more sensitive and accurate in detecting acute synovitis than unenhanced MRI scans. During contrast-enhanced imaging, the enhancement lasts for approximately 5 min after the injection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The contrast agent reaches the synovial fluid after 6-10 min, which is when imaging provides the best results.</p><p>The objectives of the study were to compare the sensitivities and accuracies of ultrasound and contrast-enhanced MRI in the detection of subclinical synovitis and tenosynovitis in the wrist, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The original study protocol (FMU/CL/15/19 dated 21 June 2019) was approved by the Fujian Medical University Review Board.

The examination was performed with the subject sitting in an upright posture, and the fully pronated hand was positioned on a cushion (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The scan plane was marked on the skin with a marker. In case of the wrist, scanning of the dorsal site was performed. Scanning was performed in a transverse plane from the superior to the inferior site. Scanning of finger joints was performed in the longitudinal plane only. Scanning of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and all proximal interphalangeal joints was performed from the ulnar to the radial side in a 180&#x000b0; arc. The scanning of the second and the fifth metacarpophalangeal joints was performed from the dorsal side in a 150&#x000b0; arc, while that of the third and the fourth joint were performed in a 120&#x000b0; arc (<xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The color Doppler ultrasound setting parameters were as follows: 7 MHz Doppler frequency and Nyquist limit of 0.014 m/s. The scanning process with the color Doppler apparatus took an average of 15 min for each patient. Sonographers at ach institute (minimum 3 years of experience) were involved in the ultrasonographic assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging</title><p>The wrists, proximal interphalangeal joints, and metacarpophalangeal joints were examined by 3.0 Tesla MRI (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany).

Among them, five patients had confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (positive rheumatoid factor test), the complete data of three patients were not available as institutional records, and one female was pregnant.

A total of 75 patients were included in the study, and 450 joints were examined. This study showed that ultrasonography was as effective, sensitive, and accurate as contrast-enhanced MRI (<italic>p</italic>=0.055). The results of the study were in line with those of retrospective studies (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Contrast-enhanced MRI is a tedious and expensive diagnostic technique for the detection of synovitis and tenosynovitis (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, the inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of ultrasound were comparable to those of MRI (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Ultrasound is a good substitute for contrast-enhanced MRI for the diagnosis of subclinical synovitis and tenosynovitis.</p><p>The study enrolled patients who were symptomatic for between 6 weeks and 2 years. The present classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis are based on the erosion and the absence of other indicators (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Until 2002, patients with a disease duration shorter than 2 years were classified as having early rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, the latest definitions for early rheumatoid arthritis are a disease duration of 12 months from symptom onset and that for very early rheumatoid arthritis is 3 months from symptom onset (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Early treatment of undifferentiated arthritis and very early rheumatoid arthritis seems to represent a window of opportunity in terms of improving clinical and pharmacoeconomic outcomes. Thus, a reliable imaging technique is essential to confirm clinical findings.</p><p>There were 89 joints that were not imaged by ultrasound but were characterized as having some sort of inflammatory reaction and requiring contrast-enhanced MRI. The cases of bone marrow edema were left undetected by ultrasound. Bone marrow edema can only be detected by MRI (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) due to the spatial resolution of ultrasound (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The results of the study were in line with those of a longitudinal follow-up study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Ultrasound is a reliable, cheap, highly available, and widely accepted tool for the detection of subclinical synovitis and tenosynovitis.</p><p>The study reported that ultrasound had a sensitivity of 0.795 and contrast-enhanced MRI had a sensitivity of 0.855 for detecting synovitis and tenosynovitis. The results of the study were consistent with the results of available retrospective studies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In a retrospective study, the sensitivity of conventional radiography in the early detection of bone erosion was just 0.13, while that of MRI was 0.98 and that of ultrasound was observed to be 0.63 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The high accuracy and sensitivity are why it has become a trend to diagnose early rheumatoid arthritis using MRI (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Ultrasound or sonography is also a reliable technique for the detection of bone erosion, especially in cases of early rheumatoid arthritis, compared to other conventional techniques.</p><p>Ultrasound was found to have a lower likelihood of detecting early rheumatoid arthritis than contrast-enhanced MRI. The results of the study were in line with those of a retrospective study (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In some patients, tenosynovitis is the only finding of rheumatoid arthritis. Any tendon can be affected by tenosynovitis. At the level of the wrist, any extensor tendon sheath from compartments I to VI can be widely involved, unlike the flexors. To observe tenosynovitis, the recommended sequence for MRI is T1-weighted imaging. Ultrasound reveals a thick synovial sheath with or without hyperemia (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Excess fluid within the tendon sheath can also be observed (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Ultrasound cannot completely replace contrast-enhanced MRI in detecting inflammation of the limb joints and their soft tissues.</p><p>There are a few limitations for both techniques; for example, bone marrow edema, an early sign of rheumatoid arthritis, developed in some joints but was not detectable by ultrasonography. MRI does this task well, but requires injections of contrast agents; in some patients, the use of contrast agents is not permitted, according to guidelines published in the European Journal of Ultrasound (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>An example of the limitations of this study is that the randomized trial had better outcomes than the medical records review study. The demographic and clinical conditions also have effects on tenosynovitis and synovitis, but the study did not evaluate the confounding effects of such parameters on the outcomes of the imaging methods. The MRIs were examined by one radiologist only.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study provides new evidence to support that ultrasound has a similar sensitivity and accuracy for the diagnosis of subclinical synovitis and tenosynovitis as contrast-enhanced MRI. Patients who experience joint pain and morning stiffness should undergo sonographic assessments to detect early signs of inflammation and/or structural damage and to start the appropriate treatment to prevent bone and cartilage destruction.</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript manuscript for publication.
