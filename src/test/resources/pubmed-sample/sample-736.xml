Within the first 3&#x000a0;months of treatment, mean urine albumin creatinine ratio decreased in CKD population, which was sustained. A higher percentage of CKD patients had at least one AE compared to non-CKD patients (85.3% vs. 73.3%, respectively). The majority of AEs were mild (50.7%) or moderate (18.7%) in severity. As expected, in patients with underlying CKD, increases in serum potassium, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were more commonly reported compared to non-CKD patients.

In addition, hypertension is considered a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even though hypertension is more prevalent among adults in comparison to children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the prevalence of hypertension in the paediatric population is increasing and is estimated to be around 2&#x02013;5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In most of the cases, hypertension in pre-pubertal children is secondary to an underlying disease (e.g. renal disease, coarctation of the aorta and endocrine disease), while essential hypertension is more common in adolescents and post-pubertal children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The Fourth Report from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Working Group on Children and Adolescents defines hypertension as an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is &#x02265;&#x02009;95th percentile for gender, age and height on at least three separate occasions. Average SBP or DBP levels that are &#x02265;&#x02009;90th percentile but &#x0003c;&#x02009;95th percentile, designated as &#x02018;pre-hypertensive&#x02019;, are considered an indication of heightened risk of developing hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">There is a well-established relationship between the degree of hypertension and progressive kidney damage in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Data from the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS), 2006, showed that around 39.3% of children receiving antihypertensive treatment had chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the time of enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to The National Kidney Foundation&#x02013;Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guideline, classes of antihypertensive agents preferred for reducing cardiovascular risk and progression of CKD are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Among the preferred antihypertensive drugs, ARBs selectively inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and may also inhibit the action of angiotensin II synthesised by non-ACE-dependent pathways and control BP by differentially enhancing nitric oxide release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. ARBs help in reducing proteinuria in children and are particularly beneficial in BP management in children with proteinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, has shown to be efficacious and to provide dose-dependent reductions in BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, valsartan has shown comparable efficacy to enalapril therapy in children with hypertension aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although ARBs are commonly used in children, long-term safety and efficacy data for these antihypertensive drugs are scarce, particularly in children with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

An independent adjudicator made final determination of the CKD status for patients originally classified as non-CKD.

Similar assessments were also made for the subgroups of CKD and non-CKD patients. For msSBP and msDBP, summary statistics for baseline, post-baseline and change from baseline were calculated by weeks and at endpoint (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) using the FAS. The number and percentage of patients achieving BP control (i.e. msSBP and msDBP &#x0003c;&#x02009;95th percentile for age, gender and height) were calculated by visit and at endpoint (LOCF) using the FAS. Patients with a UACR reduction or increase of &#x02265;&#x02009;50% from baseline and eGFR reduction &#x02265;&#x02009;25% from baseline were summarised.

The current study focused on the long-term safety and tolerability of valsartan along with the efficacy in paediatric patients aged 6 to 17&#x000a0;years with or without CKD. Most patients who enrolled in the present study also had a history of concurrent medical conditions other than hypertension. Approximately 50% had renal and/or urinary abnormalities, including congenital kidney disease. In the present study, clinically significant reductions in msSBP and msDBP with valsartan were noted in the valsartan alone and valsartan + antihypertensive groups. The results obtained in this study were consistent with a previous 3-month study in 261 children with hypertension aged 6&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years, where valsartan effectively lowered SBP and DBP compared to enalapril [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The initial reduction in the msSBP and msDBP in the current study was clinically and statistically significant from week 1, and BP was well controlled in the long-term until endpoint (week 78 or LOCF) in both the overall population and the CKD and non-CKD subgroups. As noted previously, based on the significant imbalance in msDBP at baseline and the significant baseline-by-CKD status interaction in msDBP, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding comparisons between the CKD and non-CKD subgroups with respect to BP reductions.</p><p id="Par37">Any comparisons between the valsartan alone and valsartan + antihypertensive groups should be avoided because these were not randomised treatment arms and any add-on antihypertensive medication was based on individual patients&#x02019; responses to valsartan treatment at various points in time and different treatment durations per individual patient situation.</p><p id="Par38">Higher urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) is an indicator of persistent proteinuria and an important risk factor for progressive renal failure and hyperfiltration injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. UPCR levels decreased in a majority of CKD patients in a previously conducted 3-month study to a similar degree in patients receiving either valsartan or enalapril [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. UACR levels (from morning urine collections) in this study either decreased or remained the same in a majority of the patients with CKD at the 78-week endpoint compared to baseline. The reduction in UACR was noted within 3&#x000a0;months after treatment, after which the reduction was sustained throughout the duration of the study in the overall CKD population. The reduction in UACR was statistically significant through week 66 and at study endpoint. The number of patients with UACR values at the final visit was reduced and despite a reduction in UACR, the <italic>p</italic> value approached, but did not reach statistical significance. Patients in the ESCAPE trial treated with the ACEI ramipril showed an initial decline in mean UPCR (86% of samples were 24-h urine samples) within the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment. However, UPCR increased gradually to levels that were similar to the baseline over 3&#x000a0;years of continued ramipril treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In both ESCAPE and the current study, there was a relatively high proportion of patients with missing values over the duration of treatment. It was speculated that the late increase in proteinuria in ESCAPE may be related to the &#x02018;aldosterone breakthrough&#x02019; phenomenon with ACEIs thought to be related to upregulation of other enzymes like chymase. While this theoretically may be a reason for the difference in effect seen in our current study, there are studies where &#x02018;aldosterone breakthrough&#x02019; has been reported with ARBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, different progressive courses of the underlying kidney disorders in the populations of ESCAPE and our current study may be postulated as an alternate explanation for the differences in courses in proteinuria. In this respect, these results must be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="Par39">In the present long-term safety and tolerability study, valsartan was found to be safe and well tolerated. Most of the reported AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and AEs that occurred in the study were not unexpected in the study population and/or are known to be associated with ARBs. Hyperkalaemia and hypotension were the most commonly reported drug-related AEs in CKD patients. The AE profile observed in the present study was generally similar to that reported in two previously conducted valsartan studies in children 6 to 17&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Headache, cough, pyrexia and nasopharyngitis were the most common AEs reported in the overall and CKD population. In this study, headache was the most common AE reported in 24.7% of patients. This is consistent with the reported rates of headache in the general paediatric population where overall 17.1% of children aged 4 to 18&#x000a0;years were reported to have frequent or severe headaches, including migraine, in the previous 12&#x000a0;months with a higher prevalence with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The incidence of SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were higher in CKD patients compared to the overall population. These SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were mainly related to the underlying renal disease in these patients.</p><p id="Par41">Increases in serum potassium, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and a decrease in eGFR in patients with underlying CKD were observed. It is known that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors cause a decrease, often transient, in renal function as a result of decreased resistance at the efferent (post-glomerular) arteriole lowering intra-glomerular pressure and thus reducing GFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. One also cannot exclude a normal progression of the underlying renal disease.</p><p id="Par42">A limitation of the present study is that there was no control group and it was an open-label design. In addition, no direct formal comparison can be made in the difference in treatment response between the valsartan alone and the valsartan + antihypertensive subgroups or between the CKD and non-CKD subgroups since the groups were not prospectively randomised. These subgroups are considered to represent different populations and it was also noted that there was a difference in baseline blood pressures and a higher proportion of Asians in the CKD compared to the non-CKD subgroup. In addition, the patients in the valsartan + antihypertensive group received concomitant antihypertensive medication based on individual patients&#x02019; conditions at any time during the treatment period. Thus, no clear interpretation for potential treatment differences between subpopulations (e.g. CKD vs. non-CKD or &#x02018;valsartan alone&#x02019; vs. &#x02018;valsartan + antihypertensive&#x02019;) can be made.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">In this population of hypertensive children aged 6 to 17&#x000a0;years with or without CKD, valsartan was generally well tolerated, with an AE profile consistent with that of an ARB in the overall population and in patients with underlying CKD. The efficacy of valsartan alone or in combination with other antihypertensives was maintained in the long term, and a beneficial effect on proteinuria was observed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all the clinical investigators and study coordinators at the participating centres, all the patients who participated in the study and local laboratory and health facility staff.
