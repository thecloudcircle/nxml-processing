Majority of NPC cases present in late stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The late presentation of the disease is due to the hidden location of the tumour, which could present with either no or apparently trivial symptoms which could be dismissed by patients or even medical professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, disease recurrence, therapeutic resistance and metastasis remain major clinical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The cancer stem cell (CSC) model hypothesizes that there is a hierarchy within the tumour cell population and only a rare subset of cancer cells has the ability to self-renew and to differentiate, leading to the recapitulation of the original tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As such, the spread of CSCs is an important component of the process of metastasis and, reactivation of CSC proliferation is believed to be the underlying cause of disease recurrence.</p><p>CSCs are found to behave differently from the rest of tumour cells; amongst others, they have enriched tumour-forming potential, and have efficient drug extrusion systems to evade most chemotherapeutic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These cells undergo asymmetric divisions to give rise to daughter cells: one which will be stem-like and, the other which does not show stem cell characteristics. Some CSC-enriched subpopulations were slower in proliferation (reviewed in Moore <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]), whilst others reported an equal or rapid proliferation rate than the non-CSC subpopulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>As drug extrusion is one of the properties for CSC, several groups had adapted the original side population (SP) assay by Goodell <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] for identification of putative stem cells and progenitors in solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The ability of SP cells to extrude the Hoechst 33342 dye, causing them to appear as a dimly stained side population in flow cytometry dot plots, is dependent on the activity of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family which includes ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Verapamil is a potent inhibitor for ABCB1 which also weakly inhibits ABCG2 activities, while fumitremorgin C (FTC) specifically inhibits ABCG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. By adding one of these inhibitors into the SP assay, one can determine the type of ABC transporter protein which is responsible for the dye extrusion activity. Prior to this report, there was an earlier publication on the use of SP assay in well- and poorly-differentiated NPC cell lines which indicated that putative CSC in these cell lines may be related to ABCB1 activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> tumourigenicity assay was performed for only 4 weeks and the identity of the cell line chosen to perform downstream functional experiments was questioned in a later publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>NPC HK1 is a cell line established from a well-differentiated recurrent NPC sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], while xeno-284 is a xenograft line established in our laboratory from a poorly differentiated recurrent metastatic NPC sample. In this study, we first tested for the presence of the SP subpopulation in HK1 and xeno-284 NPC cells, followed by sorting of SP and non-SP (NSP) subpopulations for comparison of <italic>in vitro</italic> clone morphology, cell division and proliferation. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) flow-staining was carried out to determine the level of ALDH activity in the sorted cells. Gene expression studies were also performed to identify stem cell related genes and pathways which may be responsible for the observations. Finally, <italic>in vivo</italic> tumourigenicity experiments were performed for duration of up to 7 weeks to evaluate the tumour-initiating ability of SP and NSP cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>HK1 contains SP cell subpopulation</title><p>The identity of the HK1 NPC cells used was validated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling to be identical to the HK1 cells used by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The SP phenotype as identified by low Hoechst 33342 blue/red fluorescence intensity was detected in 5-10% of HK1 cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

However, these approaches may not be universal in identifying the same phenotype (s) of CSCs within a particular cancer (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). In NPC, different CSC markers had been reported from the same cell lines generated from primary NPC cases (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this study, we aim to evaluate the presence of CSCs in a cell line established from recurrent NPC by the SP approach.</p><p>Results from our various <italic>in vitro</italic>-based assays indicate that the SP cells of HK1 were stem-like. During a week&#x02019;s growth in fully-supplemented RPMI medium, both SP and NSP cells exhibited different morphology of the colonies in <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. SP cells grew into tightly packed clusters of holoclones, a particular clonal growth morphology closely associated with stem cells and self-renewal ability, as opposed to NSP cells which mostly grew as meroclones and/or paraclones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. SP cells in HK1 were also found to be significantly enhanced with ALDH activity, which is known to enhance cancer cell survival and therapy resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of <italic>ABCG2</italic> mRNA level in HK1 SP cells which further indicated the type of ABC transporter being studied here. These SP cells also showed increased mRNA levels for <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TERT</italic> which were associated with CSC biology and maintenance of pluripotency state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Over-expression of Hedgehog pathway genes such as <italic>GLI1</italic>, <italic>GLI2</italic>, <italic>GLI3FL, PTCH1</italic> and <italic>PTCHD2</italic> was in line with reports that Hedgehog pathway can induce <italic>ABCG2</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and it was activated in stem-like cells in EBV positive NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Nonetheless, there were other findings in our study which seemingly suggested that the stem-like characteristic of SP cells in HK1 may be transient. SP cells of HK1 grew slower in culture which is in line with reports that CSCs from various tumours had slower proliferation rate and hence evaded chemotherapeutic agents which targeted fast growing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, the slower rate gradually diminished after a week (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Also, in long term culture, NSP cells gave rise to SP cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Together, these two time course <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (proliferation assay and asymmetry assay) indicated that the difference between SP and NSP sorted cells may be transient, as both type of cells could interconvert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>The indication that SP cells can only maintain a transient stem-like phenotype in HK1 might well explain the discordance of our <italic>in vitro</italic> results with <italic>in vivo</italic> results.

The discordance of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results is not uncommon, as it has been reported in studies utilizing SP approach to identify CSC in thyroid cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] as well as studies using marker approach to identify CSC in NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our study, although HK1 SP cells were significantly enriched for ALDH<sup>bright</sup> cells, there were 5% of ALDH<sup>bright</sup> cells in NSP cells. Wu <italic>et al</italic>. had reported that ALDH positive cells are CSCs in NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. If ALDH positive cells were also CSCs in recurrent NPC, this would lend credence to our observation of HK1 NSP cells&#x02019; ability to generate tumour growth may be partially due to the subset of ALDH positive cells in them.</p><p>Our negative findings in <italic>in vivo</italic> study suggested that SP approach in HK1 cells only enriches for a certain subtype with stem-cell features but not bona fide CSCs as depicted by both SP and NSP subpopulations&#x02019; ability to confer tumour growth in mice. This is in contrast to an earlier report that showed significant tumour growth difference of SP cells over NSP cells in NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The disparity may be related to firstly, the type of NPC cell line being studied. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. utilized CNE-2 cells which had been reported to be contaminated with a partial genome of HeLa, whereas HK1 NPC cells used in this study was verified by STR profiling to be free from HeLa cell contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Secondly, we used FTC as a dye efflux inhibitor to identify ABCG2-specific SP cells from HK1 and xeno-284 cells, instead of verapamil, a classic inhibitor for ABCB1-expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] which showed no inhibition in our study but was used in the above mentioned study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our negative finding was in line with Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. which reported that ABCG2 was not a CSC marker for NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Lastly, the length of tumour assessment time in <italic>in vivo</italic> was different. Mice inoculated with CNE-2 SP and NSP cells were euthanized 4 weeks after inoculation, whereas our mice were observed for 7 weeks. As the incubation time was relatively short, there remains a possibility of CNE-2 NSP cells giving rise to tumour in mice after 4 weeks of inoculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study shows that ABCG2-specific SP cell subpopulation is found in HK1 NPC cells, a cell line generated from well-differentiated recurrent NPC but they are minimal in xeno-284 cells, a xenograft derived from poorly differentiated metastatic NPC. In spite of <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence proposing that CSCs from HK1 can be identified by the SP approach, <italic>in vivo</italic> validation study showed that both SP and NSP cells of HK1 had similar tumourigenicity potential. Therefore, we conclude that the SP approach alone cannot identify CSCs accurately in HK1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Cell line and culture conditions</title><p>HK1 NPC cells were cultured in fully-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, NY, USA) in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C. The cells were confirmed to be mycoplasma-free by periodical testing with Venor GeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit for Conventional PCR (Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Digestion of xenograft sample</title><p>Xeno-284 NPC xenograft was freshly harvested and rinsed with cold sterile PBS supplemented with 1X antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco, NY, USA). After removing visible blood capillaries and/or necrotic tissue, the xenograft tissue was minced finely in the presence of 1X collagenase/dispase solution (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The mixture was incubated for 60 min in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C with constant agitation. The cell suspension and undigested xenograft pieces were separated by sieving through 40 &#x003bc;m cap strainer. After a brief centrifugation step, the cell pellet was resuspended in RBC lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and, the cells were rinsed with sterile PBS prior to cell count and viability check.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Hoechst 33342 staining assay</title><p>HK1 NPC cells at a logarithmic growth phase were detached by Accutase (Millipore, MA, USA) and washed at least once with PBS prior to Hoechst 33342-staining. A modification of Goodell&#x02019;s method was used to stain both HK1 and xeno-284 NPC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Briefly, the cells were re-suspended at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mL in warm HBSS buffer (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 10mM HEPES (&#x0201c;HBSS+&#x0201d;). Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) was added into the cell suspension at a final concentration of 5 &#x003bc;M in the presence or absence of the ABCG2 inhibitor, fumitremorgin C (FTC) at a final concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M (Sigma, MO, USA) or verapamil (ABCB1 inhibitor) at a final concentration of 50 and 100 &#x003bc;M (Sigma, MO, USA). The cells were incubated for 90 min in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath with intermittent mixing. Excessive Hoechst 33342 dye was removed from the cell suspension by washing with cold HBSS+. The resulting pellet was resuspended to a final concentration of 1 &#x02013; 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mL with cold HBSS+. In order to delineate host mouse cells, xeno-284 cells were further stained with H2Kd-PE antibody (1:10, BD Pharmingen, MA, USA) for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Propidium iodide (PI, 2 &#x003bc;M, BD Pharmingen, MA, USA) was added to stained HK1 NPC cells and, 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen, MA, USA) to Hoechst-stained xeno-284 cells for determination of cell viability. The stained cells were analyzed and sorted in a BD FACSAria II SORP cytometer (BD Biosciences, MA, USA) equipped with a 355 nm-UV laser power of 50 mW. The Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was detected via a 405/20 band-pass filter (Hoechst Blue) and a 670 long pass filter (Hoechst Red). The sorted SP and NSP cells were collected in fully-supplemented RPMI medium. Presence of cells is reported as percentages of single, viable SP or NSP cells. Subsequent experiments were performed using HK1 NPC cells as xeno-284 NPC xenograft had too few SP cells for sorting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Clone morphology assay</title><p>Sorted cells were plated at a low cell density of 50 cells per well in a 96-well culture plate containing fully-supplemented RPMI medium. Upon seeding, microscopic inspection of each well was performed to ensure there was no cell clumping. Once the cells were adherent, the culture medium was changed every two days. The numbers of holoclones, meroclones and paraclones were counted on day 8 post-sorting. Data were recorded from three independent experiments with 12 replicate wells per SP or NSP cells in each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay</title><p>Sorted cells were left for overnight recovery in the culture conditions as mentioned above. The cells were detached using Accutase and ALDH staining was performed with the ALDEFLUOR staining kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Briefly, 0.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were resuspended in ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing 1.5 &#x003bc;M ALDH activated substrate, BAAA and incubated for 45 mins at 37&#x000b0;C. Half of each sorted sample was treated with 15 &#x003bc;M DEAB, an inhibitor of ALDH. The stained cells were washed, resuspended in cold ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing 2 &#x003bc;M PI and analyzed in BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, MA, USA). Data were obtained from five independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Asymmetric division assay</title><p>Ten thousand sorted cells were recultured for three weeks in fully-supplemented RPMI medium.

The &#x0201c;recovered&#x0201d; cells were seeded at 3000 cells per 200 &#x003bc;L into each well of the E-plate 16 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Cell index values were recorded over a period of 125 hours with an interval of 1 hour for the first day, followed by every 6 hours for the remaining experiment by the xCELLigence System&#x02019;s Real time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) DP instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Cell index values represent measurements of electrical impedance of monitored cells which reflect cell growth (number and viability), morphology and adhesion ability. The cell index values of SP and NSP cells at each time point were then normalized to the control cells (HK1 cells which were only stained with PI and sorted from PI negative gate). Data were obtained from three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Stem cell gene expression study</title><p>Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Human Stem Cell and Stem Cell Signalling PCR Arrays (SABiosciences, MD, USA). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and cleaned with RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). The quality and concentration of the extracted RNA was determined with NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, DE, USA) and only samples with a 260/280 ratio of&#x02009;~&#x02009;1.8 were used for reverse transcription. Total RNA (100 ng) was reverse-transcribed using the accompanying First Strand Synthesis Kit and cDNA was amplified using SYBR green/ROX master mix in the ABI7500 Fast Real-Time thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Genes with Ct values of more than 35 were removed from analysis. Ct value of each gene was normalized against the geometric mean Ct value of five housekeeping genes (Ct <sub>geoHK</sub>), with the formula 2<sup>-dCt</sup> (dCt&#x02009;=&#x02009;Ct <sub>gene of interest</sub> &#x02013; Ct <sub>geoHK</sub>). The normalized &#x000d7;values were used to calculate fold change ratios between SP and NSP.

Sorted cells were mixed with BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences, MA, USA) and inoculated subcutaneously into 5 &#x02013; 6-week-old nude mice (Balb/c nu/nu). Tumour latency data, defined as the period between the inoculation day to the first day of tumour detection, were recorded. Once a palpable growth was detected, tumour volume was recorded every two days. Tumour volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) was calculated from 0.5 &#x000d7; (width &#x000d7; length<sup>2</sup>). All tumours were harvested once the length or width reached 10 mm or on day 50 post-inoculation. Limiting dilution analysis was performed using the Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/">http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/</ext-link>).
