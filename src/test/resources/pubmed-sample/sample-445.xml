To understand how the blastema retains the original structural form, we investigate cellular transitions and transcriptional characteristics of cell identity genes during all stages of regeneration of an amputated lower jaw. We find that mesenchymal blastema originates from multiple sources including nucleated blood cells, fibroblasts, damaged muscle cells and pigment cells. These cells are transformed into two populations of blastemal progenitors: <italic>foxi1</italic>-expression and <italic>isl1</italic>-expression, before giving rise to cartilage, bone, and muscle. Time point- based transcriptomal analysis of 45 annotated Hox genes reveal that five 3&#x02032;-end Hox genes and an equal number of 5&#x02032;-end Hox genes are activated largely at the stage of blastema reformation. RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization shows that <italic>foxi1</italic> and <italic>pax3a</italic> are respectively expressed in the presumptive mandible skeletal region and regenerating muscle at 5 dpa. In contrast, <italic>hoxa2b</italic> and <italic>hoxa11b</italic> are widely expressed with different domain in chondrogenic blastema and blastema mesenchyme. Knockdown <italic>foxi1</italic> changes the expression patterns of <italic>sox9a</italic> and <italic>hoxa2b</italic> in chondrogenic blastema. From these results we propose that two origins of blastemal progenitors define blastema skeleton and muscle respecifications through distinct signaling pathways. Meanwhile, the positional identity of blastema reformation is implicated in mesenchymal segmentation and characteristic expression pattern of Hox genes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission to JY (13ZZ126), the International Cooperation Initiative Program of Shanghai Ocean University to JY (A3602120001), and a ShOU Excellent Postgraduate Research Award to HH (B9400-10-0006-3).

Most tissues and body parts can heal by regeneration (the necrotic cells are replaced by the same tissue as was originally there) and/or by repair (injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue). Unlike mammals most invertebrate species, as well as certain urodeles and fish among vertebrate species, are able to regenerate lost appendages such as arms, legs and fins, as well as many other types of tissue <xref rid="pone.0045380-Poss1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045380-Whited1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Understanding the cellular and molecular responses in regenerating complicated structures in fish will eventually provide novel insights to promote tissue and organ regeneration in mammals and humans <xref rid="pone.0045380-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>There are three cell-based regeneration mechanisms: regeneration via direct cell division from differentiated cells, via cell division from undifferentiated progenitors or stem cells, and by dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation from the differentiated cells <xref rid="pone.0045380-Jopling1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The first two mechanisms are also called compensatory regeneration, exemplified by mammalian liver regeneration <xref rid="pone.0045380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and zebrafish cardiomyocytes, melanocytes, and beta cell- regenerations <xref rid="pone.0045380-Kikuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045380-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The third mechanism closely matches blastema formation, a mass of cells capable of growth and regeneration into organs or body parts <xref rid="pone.0045380-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Blastema is typically found in the early stages of an organism's development such as in embryos, and in the regeneration of tissue, organs and bone. Histologically a blastema is composed of undifferentiated pluripotent cells. Although the majority of published studies suggest that the dedifferentiation of mesodermal tissues contributes to limb and fin blastema formation <xref rid="pone.0045380-Poss1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the cellular and molecular characteristics of blastemal cells are far less clear. Little is known about how the blastema reestablishes structural form and appropriate tissue polarity.</p><p>Zebrafish represent a valuable vertebrate model for studying the regeneration of complex body structures, because it is easily visualized and manipulated in the laboratory and many of the same genes involved in human development are conserved in sequence and function in fish <xref rid="pone.0045380-Mathew1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045380-Zupanc1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. As in other vertebrates, the zebrafish mandible is derived from embryonic neural crest cells. These cells interact with a variety of craniofacial epithelia to produce intricate structures of the face, skull, teeth, and jaw <xref rid="pone.0045380-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, blastema and neural crest share some common properties with mesenchymal stem cells. To elucidate the extent to which fetal cranial neural crest tissue specification and adult blastema regeneration are similar, we investigated the cellular behavior and positional identity underlying blastema formation and reformation during regeneration of zebrafish lower jaws. We found that chondrogenic blastema of the regenerating mandible maintains the developmental information of the cranial neural crest but also integrates with hematopoietic components.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Time course of regeneration of zebrafish lower jaws</title><p>The zebrafish lower jaw consists of the mandible, hyoid apparatus and all the attached mandibular muscles (Mm) and other connective tissues. The mandible (Md) consists of two dermal bones surrounding a cartilaginous rod known as Meckel's cartilage (Mc). The two mandibles are joined at their distal ends by a mandibular symphysis (Ms) that is cartilaginous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;D</xref>). We studied the regenerative process following a transverse amputation that removed one-third of the mandible and associated tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g001">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). Within minutes post-injury, active bleeding stopped by blood clot at the injury site (homeostasis), followed by formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix covering the cut surface of the damaged muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). In the following several hours, infiltration of nucleated blood cells (nbc) and a thin layer of epidermis were seen at the wound site. At 8 hpa, the epidermis became thicker as the number of infiltrated cells dramatically decreased under the provisional basement membrane. Within the following 1&#x02013;2 days, the wound was closed by the stratified epithelia adhering to the underlying dermal matrix.</p><fig id="pone-0045380-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0045380.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Anatomical structure and regenerative capability of zebrafish lower jaw.</title><p>C&#x02013;F, Alcian blue staining of bone and cartilage of lower jaw.

After 3 weeks small bone fragments had begun to grow. By 2 months the regenerated two ridges converged and generally maintained the shape and original position of the mandibular arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), However, the two regenerated mandibular bones were bridged by bone-matrix rather than being separated by the cartilaginous median symphysis as in uncut ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

The regenerated did not retain any cartilage when the mandible regeneration was completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Therefore, zebrafish lower jaw regeneration did not recapitulate all steps in larval skeletal development although cartilage and bone appeared in the same sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045380.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0045380-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0045380.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Regenerative capability of zebrafish mandible.</title><p>The regenerated bone and cartilage are shown by Alcian blue staining.

Scale bars, 50 &#x000b5;m. Figure C shows two types of chondrogenic ossification. After blastema formation (8 dpa), chondrogenic blastema was composed of three chondrogenic ossification centers: two Meckel-lateral centers (Mlc) and one median symphysis center (Msc). In the Meckel-lateral centers, perichondral ossification was more like atypical or incomplete endochondral ossification. The surrounding matrix became calcified while the central portion of ossification center developed to bone cysts (BC), a similar structure like bone marrow cavity filled with little connective tissues (120 dpa). The median symphysis center, however, adopted perichondral ossification.

Within 4 days after amputation, a mesenchymal blastema was formed between the wound epidermis and damaged muscles (data not shown). At the 5 dpa, the blastema was compartmentalized into several zones that could be distinguished by the cell shape and polarity as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>. The cells in the central area of the blastema were arranged in circular fashion and packed in a chondrogenesis zone. In the chondrogenesis zone, a group of Alcian blue stained cells appeared and sequentially formed three cartilaginous ossification centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Two centers (referred to as the Meckel-lateral center) were first formed adjacent to Meckel's cartilage but not as a continuation of it; the third one was formed later and eventually confined to the area of amputated median symphysis cartilage (so-called median symphysis center).</p><p>In these cartilaginous centers perichondral ossification took place in a way similar but not identical to intramembranous ossification. The chondrocytes became enclosed in excessive bony matrix. Simultaneous with the death of chondrocytes, the surrounding matrix became calcified. As a result, an intervening space and bone cysts were developed in the ossification centers. Eventually the ossified bone matrix of the three ossification centers fused together to form a big plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Because the regenerative ossification pattern was more like a combination of intramembranous ossifications of the cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) -derived craniofacial skeleton, and endochondral ossification of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC)-derived bone formation <xref rid="pone.0045380-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045380-Leucht1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we postulate that the mandible regeneration may adopt a combinatory strategy. This strategy would integrate the mesoderm-derived cartilage model with CNCC-derived skeleton in the regeneration process.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Cellular characterization of wound epidermis and lower jaw-regenerating blastema</title><p>Several types of cells were observed to accumulate and emigrate during the epidermal restoration.

Following complete reepitheliation, multiple cell types including various nbc, fibroblasts, and fragmented muscle cells began to accumulate in the region between the newly formed wound dermis and the wound muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). At 4 dpa, these active cells underwent cellular disorganization with increasing extracellular matrix (ECM) and formed the characteristic blastemal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). There was no evidence to show that these nbc were dead or formed unwanted structures, such as scar or clot within blastema.

After amputation that removed the vast majority of pigment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, 2 hpa), yellow pigment cells were the first to emerge along the dorsal-lateral hypodermis and yet sparsely distributed in blastema region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, 5 dpa). At 8 dpa, enormous yellowish-grey cells appeared in the blastema region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, 8 dpa). New pigment cells could arise from the blastema cells or migrate into the blastema from the autochthonous pigmentation region. In either case, these mix-colored cells differed from the original epidermal melanocytes in pigment pattern, color, and territory. Their dislocation suggested that pigment-producing cells contribute to blastema formation and/or redifferentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Molecular characterization of blastemal cells</title><p>Thus far, our data have indicated that multiple tissues contribute to blastema formation and that blastemal cells give rise to multiple types of derivates required for restoring all structures (such as cartilage, bone, muscle, connective tissues and pigment) in a damaged lower jaw. The definitive source of the blastemal cells remains uncertain but is most likely a complex mix of cell types from the neural crest-derived and mesoderm-derived tissues.</p><p>To verify the origin of the blastemal cells at the molecular level, RNA deep sequencing analyses of blastema tissue up to 5 days after amputation was performed to determine the transcription of nine marker genes.

Relatively, <italic>hoxa11b</italic> expression was viewed along the reticular blastemal mesenchyme in the direction toward the hypodermis and the mandibular muscle. In contrast, <italic>hoxa2b</italic> expression was distributed as island-like segmentations in the blastema chondrogenic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Additionally, loss of <italic>foxi1</italic> integrity changed the cellular distribution of <italic>hoxa2b</italic>, leading to more aggregation in the center of the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

However, the way the blastema arises and reorganizes the regeneration remains unknown. Here we characterized zebrafish jaw regeneration at the cellular and molecular levels. Our data indicate that intrinsic (from the cell) and extrinsic (from the local) signals coordinate two populations of blastemal progenitors to reestablish the bony structure and mesenchymal segmentation in lower jaw regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). This study provides several insights into the mechanisms of blastema regeneration in the zebrafish lower jaw.</p><p>First, blastema cells originate from mixed sources and are transformed into the embryonic origins. Previous studies have indicated that muscle cells, mesenchymal cells, cartilage cells, nerve cells and some cells embedded in mandible peristeum, contribute to the blastema formation <xref rid="pone.0045380-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045380-Harel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045380-Nakatani1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045380-Tsonis1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our histological observations showed that nucleated blood cells, fibroblasts, fragmented muscle cells and neural crest-derived pigment cells were included in the lower jaw-regenerating blastema. Cell identity analyses indicated that the blastema-forming cells were initially transformed at 2 hpa into two populations of blastemal progenitors as marked by <italic>foxi1</italic>-expression and <italic>isl1</italic>-expression. The two origins of blastemal progenitors determined blastema respecifications toward CNCC-skeletal and mesodermal regenerations respectively.</p><p>Second, blastema restoration of the original skeletal structures needs two phases of transitional transformations: mesenchymalization and chondrogenesis. Prior to blastema formation, quite a few cell types aggregated at the prospective blastema region. Most of them were not mesenchymal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g005">Fig. 5AB</xref>). After reepitheliation was completed, almost all type cells were converted to the mesenchymal phenotype with increasing ECM. After blastema formation, the disorganized blastemal cells were reorganized and largely transformed into a transitional chondrogenesis center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). As tissue specification of three distinct streams of CNCCs requires production of three developmental intermediate arches that allow dynamic signaling communication between skeletogenic CNCCs and neighboring endodermal and ectodermal tissues <xref rid="pone.0045380-Knight1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, blastema reorganizes the structural pattern of the regeneration through mesenchyme and transitional chondrogenesis. Like a transitional fill-in structure occupying a larger part of the blastema region, the chondrogenic ossification centers could facilitate cell-cell interaction and signaling communication between the blastema and the surrounding tissues.</p><p>Third, the blastemal cells retain the positional information to orchestrate mesenchymalization and chondrogenesis. The activity of Hox genes not only indicates the origins of the blastemal cells but also modulates the cell positions within the neighborhood. We found that several of 3&#x02032;end and 5&#x02032; Hox genes were characteristically expressed in the blastema-regeneration. They were activated mostly during blastema reformation; <italic>hoxa2b</italic> was expressed particularly in chondrocytes while <italic>hoxa11b</italic> was expressed mainly in the blastema mesenchyme. This is consistent with the previous reports that induction of <italic>hoxa2</italic> after neural crest migration selectively results in mirror-image homeotic transformation of a subset of first-arch structures toward hyoid morphology <xref rid="pone.0045380-Pasqualetti1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>; in contrast, <italic>hoxa13</italic> and <italic>hoxa11</italic> expression persisted in the appendicular skeleton. Even after transplantation into a Hox-negative mandibular environment the tibial grafts still maintain their Hox-positive status <xref rid="pone.0045380-Leucht1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. According to these data, misexpression of 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; Hox genes in the first arch region where the neural crest cells should be Hox-negative <xref rid="pone.0045380-Kanzler1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, would lead to deformity of the lower jaw regeneration. We are not surprised that the mandibular symphysis cartilage was displaced by excessive regeneration of bone matrix even though the environment fully supported the chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, many signaling pathways that function in larval organogenesis are reactivated during the blastema regeneration process. Previous studies have shown that <italic>foxi1</italic>, <italic>Hoxa2</italic>, and <italic>sox9a</italic> genes play crucial roles in neural crest morphogenesis and respecifications <xref rid="pone.0045380-Nissen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045380-Knight1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045380-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, the functional association between the three genes and their roles in the mandible regeneration were unknown. Our present studies revealed their coordination in defining the blastemal chondrogenesis and bone formation. We found that the three genes are expressed and partially overlap within the chondrogenic blastema after 5 days of amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). <italic>foxi1-</italic>RNA integrity is necessary for proper expression and distribution of <italic>hoxa2</italic> and <italic>sox9a</italic> in chondrogenic blastema(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). We also demonstrated that <italic>isl1-pax3a</italic> pathway is important for head muscle regeneration. Thus, the regeneration model can be used to study the complicated signaling pathways as a supplement to the developmental model.</p><p>In conclusion, we used adult zebrafish to investigate how damaged tissues are regenerated and rearranged into the nearly precise three-dimensional skeletal elements of the amputated lower jaw. We established a dual-origin model of blastema regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045380-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). According to this model, the positional identity of the blastema reformation is implicated in the regional distribution of blastemal cells along the blastema mesenchyme, appearing more like mesenchymal segmentation.</p><p>A wider implication of this study is that the success or failure of complex tissue regeneration, or stem cell therapy, to heal extensive injury might be spatiotemporally controlled by pre-existing positional information and local signaling communications. In many cases, it may be unrealistic to expect completely faithful restoration of original structures because of the lack of positional information. Comprehensive analyses of the present deep RNA-seq data will facilitate us to decode successive cell-type conversions in blastema formation and reformation during zebrafish lower jaw regeneration. In the long term, by understanding how dynamic tissue interactions guide facial skeleton repair, we hope to be able to direct human induced blastemal cells to rebuild damaged faces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Zebrafish TAB lines (hybrid from AB and Tubingen lines) were maintained under an ambient temperature of 27&#x000b0;C with a timer-controlled light period 14 h light and 10 h dark.

To determine and compare gene expression levels between two time points, we used Cuffdiff program in cufflinks to obtain differential expressed genes with significant expression (<italic>q</italic> value&#x0003c;0.05). The complete protocol is available upon request. All data are available at the NCBI short read archive under study number SRA048162.1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0045380.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
