However, this may be unsuited for accurate quantification of small tissues samples. We propose a new methodology that improves through-plane resolution using a novel 3D acquisition technique over multiple breath-holds. In this study, we compared this new approach to the reference multi-slice 2D approach using a respiratory motion phantom.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The proposed 3D sequence employs a Cartesian projection of radial sectors, where each opposite sector pair is acquired in a single readout crossing through the center of k-space at the acquisition window midpoint (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Spatial resolution is gained in 3D via partial kz (~62%) and circular shutter Field-of-View (FOV) (~27% reduction), yielding ~3x improvement in through-plane resolution.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>a) Profile ordering of the proposed 3D method. b) Motion phantom and T1 maps from the reference IR-SE and from the 3D sequence, respectively</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1532-429X-17-S1-O2-1"/></fig><p>Imaging was performed using 1.5T MRI (Philips Achieva) with a 4-channel array on a respiratory motion phantom with 12 conical vials with varying Gd concentrations (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The proposed 3D sequence employed a 5-(3s)-3 Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) over ~11 heart beats per breath-hold. 2D MOLLI was also acquired across the same FOV. The following breathing patterns were examined: 1) no respiratory motion, 2) 8mm respiratory drift, and 3) 4-8 mm respiratory shifts between alternating breath-holds. 1 and 2 were repeated 5x for reproducibility, and 3 was implemented 4x to introduce motion blurring in the 3D approach. The following parameters were used for both 2D and 3D MOLLI: FOV (185x185x80mm), # of breath-holds (n=8), resolution (1.7x2.1 mm) with 2D vs 3D slice thickness/resolution = 10 vs 3.1 mm (8 and 26 slices, respectively). SENSE with R=2 acceleration was also used. A reference IR-SE scan was used to determine the reference T1 values for each vial. Relative T1 error of the 2D and 3D MOLLI measurements was calculated as &#x02206;T1 = 100*|T1<sub>meas</sub>-T1<sub>Ref</sub>|/T1<sub>Ref</sub>. All measurements were performed using custom software. Student's t-test was used to compare inter-technique T1 measurements (p&#x0003c;0.05 significant).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Both static 2D and 3D MOLLI yielded comparable (p=0.4) relative error with respect to the reference IR-SE T1 measurements. Under an 8mm mid-breath-hold drift, 2D MOLLI was unable to yield T1 values in 5 out of the 12 vials (42%), while 3D MOLLI allowed T1 measurement of all vials. The variation in the average T1 measurements across the 5 repeated scans was less with the 3D approach (2D vs 3D: 18.5&#x000b1;7 vs 8.4&#x000b1;6 ms; p&#x0003c;0.05). T1 mapping was feasible even under motion blurred 3D volumes, and both measured T1 values and T1 error were comparable to those from static 3D volumes (p=0.5, p=0.3, respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Respiratory motion can result in failure of conventional 2D T1 mapping. The proposed novel 3D T1 mapping scheme performs robustly in the presence of respiratory motion at a significantly higher spatial resolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>N/A.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Relative T1 Error: 100*|T1<sub>meas</sub> - T1<sub>IR-SE</sub> |/T1<sub>IR-SE</sub></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">T1<sub>meas</sub></th><th align="center">% Error vs Ref IR-SE</th><th align="center">P-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">2D Static</td><td align="center">9.8 &#x000b1; 4.8</td><td align="center">P = NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">2D with Respiratory Drift</td><td align="center">10.0 &#x000b1; 5.1</td><td align="center">P = NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">2D with Respiratory Shift</td><td align="center">11.7 &#x000b1; 7.7</td><td align="center">P = NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">3D Static</td><td align="center">7.6 &#x000b1; 6.1</td><td align="center">P = NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">3D with Respiratory Drift</td><td align="center">9.6 &#x000b1; 9.3</td><td align="center">P = NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">3D with Respiratory Shift</td><td align="center">9.1 &#x000b1; 9.2</td><td align="center">P = NS</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All pairwise comparisons yielded non-significant (NS) p-values (P &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></body></article>
