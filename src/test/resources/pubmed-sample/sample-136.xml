However, little is known on the impact of those variant CALR proteins on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Methods: The impact of the expression of Wild Type (WT) or mutant CALR on ER homeostasis was assessed by quantifying the expression level of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) target genes, splicing of X-box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1), and the expression level of endogenous lectins. Pharmacological and molecular (siRNA) screens were used to identify mechanisms involved in CALR mutant proteins degradation. Coimmunoprecipitations were performed to define more precisely actors involved in CALR proteins disposal. Results: We showed that the expression of CALR mutants alters neither ER homeostasis nor the sensitivity of hematopoietic cells towards ER stress-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the expression of CALR variants is generally low because of a combination of secretion and protein degradation mechanisms mostly mediated through the ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD)-proteasome pathway. Moreover, we identified a specific ERAD network involved in the degradation of CALR variants. Conclusions: We propose that this ERAD network could be considered as a potential therapeutic target for selectively inhibiting CALR mutant-dependent proliferation associated with MPN, and therefore attenuate the associated pathogenic outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>calreticulin</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>MPN</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cancers-11-01921"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Essential Thrombocythaemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) are classical Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) characterized by a proliferation predominantly affecting the megakaryocytic compartment [<xref rid="B1-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pathophysiology of these diseases became clearer after the discovery of mutations in Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) [<xref rid="B2-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and in the thrombopoietin receptor MPL [<xref rid="B6-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that were responsible for the constitutive activation of the Janus Kinase &#x02013; Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. More recently, mutations in the calreticulin gene (<italic>CALR</italic>) bridged some gaps in our understanding of the oncogenesis of JAK2- and MPL-unmutated ET and PMF [<xref rid="B7-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Calreticulin is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident lectin, mainly involved in the quality control and productive folding of secretory glycoproteins [<xref rid="B9-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Calreticulin, together with its transmembrane homolog calnexin [<xref rid="B10-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] binds monoglucosylated, newly synthesized glycoproteins and contributes to their productive folding before export to their final destination site [<xref rid="B11-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. When newly synthesized glycoproteins cannot achieve proper folding due to the presence of mutations or environmental challenges, they enter a glycoprotein quality control machinery, comprising Uridine Diphosphate-glucose glucosyl transferases (UGGT) and ER mannosidases that will allow for more folding cycles [<xref rid="B12-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Glycoproteins remaining improperly folded after these additional cycles are triggered for degradation through the ER Associated Degradation (ERAD)-proteasome system [<xref rid="B13-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Misfolded proteins may accumulate in the ER, for instance, when ERAD is saturated, thereby leading to a condition known as ER stress [<xref rid="B14-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ER stress triggers an adaptive signaling pathway named the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that aims at restoring ER homeostasis [<xref rid="B15-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The UPR has been associated to different aspects of oncogenesis, mainly in solid tumors [<xref rid="B16-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In MPN, the only available data concern Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in which UPR has been demonstrated as protective against cell mortality [<xref rid="B17-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus far, however, there is scarce data documenting the role of the UPR or even the existence of an ER stress in non-CML MPN.</p><p>The <italic>CALR</italic> mutations discovered in ET and PMF consist of +1/&#x02212;2 frameshift insertions/deletions in the exon 9, thereby leading to the generation of a novel positively charged C-terminal sequence with loss of the KDEL ER-retention motif [<xref rid="B7-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite recent advances highlighting the interaction between mutant CALR and the MPL receptor to trigger the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway [<xref rid="B18-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the precise mechanisms involved in the oncogenic properties of those CALR variants remain poorly understood. Moreover, the subcellular localization and the fate of CALR variants remain controversial. Indeed, while some groups have detected these proteins mainly in the ER [<xref rid="B7-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], others have suggested their preferential localization in the Golgi apparatus [<xref rid="B18-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Besides, while the secretion of CALR mutant proteins has been suggested [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], other studies pointed towards a possible instability of these proteins and their subsequent degradation [<xref rid="B18-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In order to develop therapeutic agents that specifically target the cells expressing CALR variant proteins, the determination of their biochemical properties appears to be instrumental. In the present study, we show that expression of CALR variants in various cell culture models does not significantly disturb ER homeostasis. To our surprise, CALR variants were found to be faintly expressed in cells, in part because of an excessive secretion associated with the loss of the KDEL motif, but also due to a catabolic process mainly mediated by the ERAD-proteasome system, thus allowing us to believe that MPN-associated CALR variants might indeed be considered as improperly folded proteins. To follow up on this, we identified specific components of the ERAD machinery that target the CALR variants and process them for degradation. Collectively, we show that CALR variants are genuine ERAD substrates and propose that modulations of ERAD activity could represent a therapeutic target for CALR-mutated MPN patients to attenuate CALR variant-dependent MPL activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-cancers-11-01921"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-cancers-11-01921"><title>2.1. Mutant CALR are Faintly Expressed in Transfected and Primary Cells</title><p>In order to study the properties of mutant CALR proteins, we constructed plasmidic vectors to express the wild type (WT) or the two most frequent mutant forms of CALR: type 1 (del52) or type 2 mutant (ins5). Unexpectedly, when these plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells, we observed that mutant proteins were faintly expressed, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B. Indeed, upon transfection of the WT CALR encoding plasmid, a two-fold increase of total CALR protein level was observed, whereas this increase was only 1.2&#x02013;1.5-fold after mutant allele expression. The low expression level of del52 was particularly obvious since this mutant protein presents a lower apparent molecular weight than the endogenous WT protein, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B. To make sure this was not an artifact due to transfection, mutant CALR protein level was studied in patients&#x02019; primary cells.</p><p>Western blots of platelets and polymorphonuclear cells purified from patients&#x02019; blood samples carrying CALR mutations confirmed a low level of mutant proteins. No difference in the expression level of mutant CALR proteins was observed between platelets and polymorphonuclear cells, suggesting that the presence of the MPL receptor did not affect the low expression level of CALR mutant proteins. In these two cell types, the difference of expression between WT and mutant CALR was even more pronounced than in transfected HEK293T cells, with del52 mutant protein being sometimes undetectable, despite high levels of WT protein, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D.</p><p>We thought of three main mechanisms to explain a lower expression level of variant CALR proteins: inefficient transcription/translation, protein degradation or, as these variant proteins are characterized by a loss of their KDEL ER-retention motif, increased leakage into the extracellular medium. A poor transcription rate was ruled out since CALR mutant mRNA were largely predominant when quantified in transfected HEK293T cells using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f001">Figure 1</xref>E. Moreover, the ratio of mutated to total CALR mRNA determined in peripheral PMN was near 0.5 for most of the patients studied, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f001">Figure 1</xref>F. To address the question of the CALR secretion, proteins contained in the culture supernatants of transfected cells were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and analyzed by Western blot. We confirmed the detection of mutant CALR proteins in the extracellular medium while the WT protein was undetectable, thus confirming that a secretion process explained part of the low expression level of CALR variant proteins. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-cancers-11-01921"><title>2.2. Proteasome-Mediated Degradation Participates in Low CALR Mutant Expression</title><p>Secretion of mutated proteins is at least partly responsible for their low expression levels; however, since mutant to wild type ratios were even lower in primary cells, and because CALR is a central actor of the quality control system of glycoproteins in the secretory pathway, we wondered if excessive protein degradation could also partly explain the low expression level of CALR mutant proteins. CALR variants could therefore be considered misfolded proteins and would become substrates of the ERAD-proteasome system. To address this question, we treated transfected HEK293T cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. This treatment increased CALR variants expression by mean factors of 2.9 and 1.8 for del52 and ins5 variants respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0323), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B. </p><p>These results indicate that both leakage to the extracellular medium and increased proteasome degradation participate in the reduction of mutant protein levels. The secretion mechanisms are relatively straight-forward, given the loss of the KDEL motif; however, the precise pathway leading to excess mutant CALR degradation has never been investigated. To study the processes controlling expression of CALR variants more precisely, we generated plasmids allowing the expression of Myc-6His-tagged CALR proteins, which could be readily revealed by Western blotting of their Myc epitope. The CALR proteins produced from these vectors are depicted in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01921">Figure S1A</xref>. After HEK293T cell transfection, WT CALR was expressed at high levels, whereas the expression of both mutants was very low (with an about 20-fold lower expression for del52 and ins5 mutants compared to the WT protein), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D. In contrast to &#x0201c;untagged&#x0201d; proteins, Myc-6-His-tagged CALR mutant proteins were not detected in the cell supernatant, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, probably because the C-terminal part of the protein and thus the Myc-6His tag had been cleaved as previously suggested [<xref rid="B22-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In these cells, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 increased mutant CALR expression by a mean factor of five, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>E.</p><p>To confirm that our results were not restricted to the &#x0201c;readily-transfectable&#x0201d; HEK293T cell model, we generated hematopoietic cell lines in which the expression of mutant (del52 and ins5), or WT CALR alleles was induced using tetracycline-inducible lentiviral vectors pCW57.1. In K562, DAMI, UT-7-MPL, and TF-1 cells, the expression levels of CALR variants were much lower than those observed for WT CALR; del52 mutant was almost undetectable and ins5 mutant was expressed at a level ~45-fold lower than the WT, as seen in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01921">Figure S1B,C</xref>. The mean mutated to total CALR mRNA ratio for del52 and ins5 mutants were, respectively, 62% and 61% in K562 cells, 60% and 55% in DAMI cells, 50% and 51% in UT-7 MPL cells, and 20% and 33% in TF-1 cells, as seen in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01921">Figure S1D</xref>, which represent values classically observed in <italic>CALR</italic> mutated MPN patients. Despite their low expression level, CALR mutant proteins, but not the WT protein, were able to trigger the activation of the JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway, as seen in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01921">Figure S2A</xref>, and to support a Thrombopoietin (TPO)-independent growth in UT-7-MPL cells, as seen in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01921">Figure S2B</xref>. These results demonstrate that even if present in low quantity in the cells, CALR mutant proteins are able to induce a MPN phenotype as previously described [<xref rid="B18-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In hematopoietic cells, MG-132 raised del52 and ins5 mutant expression by mean factors of 15 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0091) and 12 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0019), respectively, in UT-7 MPL and 7 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0055) and 11 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0051), respectively, in DAMI cells, as seen in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01921">Figure S3A&#x02013;D</xref>. By contrast, this drug only increased the level of WT CALR by a mean factor of 1.7, 2.9, and 5.1 in HEK293T, DAMI, and UT-7-MPL cells, respectively. Of note, lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor, increased mutant protein levels with an efficacy similar to that of MG-132.</p><p>With autophagy being a second possible mechanism involved in mutant CALR degradation, we inhibited this pathway by treating transfected or transduced cells with chloroquine and bafilomycin A1. In HEK293T, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 were each able to block the autophagy process as assessed by the increase of LC3-II expression, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>F. These treatments also increased expression of del52 mutant by a mean factor of 4.2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0022) and 1.6 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0007), respectively, while they did not significantly increase WT CALR protein levels, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>F. In hematopoietic cells, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 only increased the expression levels of CALR ins5 mutant in DAMI cells by a mean factor of 2.8 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0432) and 2.7 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0177), respectively. No significant effect was observed for ins5 mutant in UT-7 MPL cells, nor for del52 mutant in DAMI and UT-7 MPL cells, despite efficient inhibition of the autophagy process as assessed by the increase of LC3-II expression level, as seen in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01921">Figure S3A&#x02013;D</xref>. Of note, inhibition of autophagy had only limited effects on the level of expression of nontagged CALR proteins, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B. For the del52 variant, we observed an increased expression by mean factors of 2.1 and 1.9 with chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 treatments (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0397 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.14 respectively). No significant effect was observed on the level of ins5 mutant protein, neither for chloroquine, nor for bafilomycin A1.</p><p>Altogether, these experiments suggested that CALR mutant proteins were secreted, but that this phenomenon cannot explain by itself the low level of expression of these proteins. This leakage in the extracellular medium is combined to a degradation process involving mainly the ERAD-proteasome and, to a lower extent, the autophagy pathways. Finally, the inhibition of the proteasome restores expression of mutant proteins to levels similar to WT CALR protein in untreated cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-cancers-11-01921"><title>2.3. Mutant CALR Expression Does Not Alter ER Homeostasis</title><p>Because CALR mutants seem to be the substrates of the ERAD-proteasome pathway, we asked whether the expression of CALR mutants disturbed ER homeostasis. Because megakaryocytes are central actors in the pathogenesis of ET and PMF, we focused on two cell lines with megakaryocytic features (UT-7 and DAMI) to address this question. Alteration of the three main branches of UPR was assessed by quantification of representative target genes (<italic>Erdj4</italic>, <italic>CHOP</italic>, <italic>HERPUD1</italic>) and splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic>. In the DAMI cell line, neither the induction of del52, nor that of ins5 CALR variants significantly induced the expression of these ER stress markers, but on the contrary, led to a global decrease in the expression of UPR target genes, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f003">Figure 3</xref>A. This was statistically significant for XBP1 mRNA splicing (for type 2 mutant, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0055) and CHOP mRNA expression (for both del52 and ins5 mutants, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0098 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0061, respectively). Similar results were observed in UT-7-MPL cells. Of note, overexpression of WT CALR showed the same trend at reducing UPR target gene expression, in particular for Erdj4 and CHOP, even if not statistically significant. Accordingly, ER stress determined by XBP1 splicing was not different between <italic>CALR</italic> mutated patients and control patients presenting with reactive thrombocytosis and/or hyperleukocytosis, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, confirming that CALR mutant expression does not disturb ER homeostasis. Because CALR variants could alter the consequences of an ER stress rather than generating it, we sought to determine whether the expression of CALR mutants could alter ER stress-induced apoptosis. A 24 h or 48h exposure of UT-7-MPL cells to tunicamycin (10 &#x003bc;g/mL), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, or MG-132 increased cell mortality in the absence, as well as in the presence of TPO. In all conditions, tunicamycin induced apoptosis to the same extent, whether cells expressed WT or mutant calreticulin. Since CALR mutations are rarely homozygous in MPN cells, as opposed to other driver mutations such as <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F or <italic>MPL</italic>W515, it can be hypothesized that normal CALR in the heterozygous cells appears sufficient to maintain cell homeostasis. </p><p>The absence of increased ER stress by CALR mutant expression could be due to a compensatory overexpression of CALR WT. To address this question, we transfected HEK293T cells with CALR WT or mutant vectors. Endogenous CALR expression was not modified by mutant CALR protein expression, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B. Similarly, induction of CALR mutants in UT-7 cells transduced with the pCW57.1 tetracyclin-inducible vector did not modify endogenous CALR expression, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f004">Figure 4</xref>C. Because the quality control system in the secretory pathway involves another lectin than CALR (calnexin or CANX), we sought to analyze CANX expression in the presence or absence of CALR variants. As observed for endogenous CALR, CANX expression level was not modified by CALR mutants. CANX phosphorylation, which may reflect its stress-regulated functions [<xref rid="B23-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], was not modified either, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f004">Figure 4</xref>D. Altogether, these results suggest that expression of CALR mutants does not significantly disturb ER homeostasis and does not impact cell sensitivity toward ER stress-induced apoptosis. Hence, CALR mutant-associated alteration of ER function does not appear to represent a significant mechanism in MPN development associated with <italic>CALR</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-cancers-11-01921"><title>2.4. ERAD-Dependent Mechanisms of CALR Variants Degradation</title><p>To get further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the degradation of CALR mutant proteins, we treated CALR expressing HEK293T with different drugs targeting the ER quality control (ERQC), ERAD pathway, and other degradation pathways. </p><p>To determine if an alternative degradation pathway involving the lysosomes was involved in CALR proteins degradation, we treated transfected HEK293T cells with a protease inhibitor cocktail (COmplete, Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B, but did not observe any significant increase in their expression. Moreover, we raised the hypothesis that mutant CALR could behave as partially misfolded proteins subjected to quality control mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the impact on CALR mutant expression of TUDCA and 4-PBA, two molecules shown to increase the ER folding capacity and decrease the misfolded protein burden [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, neither TUDCA nor 4-PBA had any significant effect, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B, suggesting that CALR variants may behave/be recognized as terminally misfolded proteins. </p><p>Regarding actors of the ERAD pathway, we did not observe any effect of the glucosidase inhibitors (Castanospermin, 1-Deoxynojirimycin), the mannosidase inhibitor (Kifunensin), the p97 inhibitor DBeQ, or Roscovitin (previously shown to increase the expression of the ERAD-substrate CFTR &#x00394;508 [<xref rid="B25-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B. These results suggested that recognition of a glycan motif was not involved in the recognition of mutant CALR proteins as a substrate for the ERAD pathway and that the proteasome-mediated degradation may not directly require the AAA+ ATPase p97. To further characterize the ERAD-dependent intermediates involved in the degradation of CALR variants, we carried out an ERQC/ERAD targeted siRNA screen in HEK293T cells and evaluated the potential stabilization of del52 and ins5 CALR mutants. Among the candidates tested, EDEM3 was identified as a key player in the degradation of both CALR mutants, whereas ERdj5/DNAJC10 appeared to be a relevant player specifically for the ins5 mutant, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D. Indeed, EDEM3 silencing led to a 1.7-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0278) and a 5.5-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0171) increase in the expression of the del52 and ins5 mutants, respectively. The effect of EDEM3 silencing on WT CALR was lower, with a mean increase of 1.5-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05). In contrast, silencing of EDEM1 and EDEM2, other members of the Endoplasmic reticulum Degradation-Enhancing &#x003b1;-Mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) family, had no impact on mutant CALR proteins expression. Of note, glucosidase II silencing did not increase CALR mutant expression levels, thereby confirming that recognition of these proteins as ERAD-substrate was glycan-independent. Finally, siRNA targeting ER chaperon (GRP94), lectins involved in transfer of ERAD-substrate to the retrotranslocon (OS-9, XTP3-B) or components of the retrotranslocon itself (SEL1L, HRD1) did not increase significantly the expression level of mutant or WT-CALR. </p><p>In order to test whether the ERAD machinery might be affected in <italic>CALR</italic>-mutated MPN patients, we analyzed the expression of select ERAD genes in the dataset generated by Rampal et al. [<xref rid="B26-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In accordance with the mechanism of CALR mutant degradation, we observed a significant deregulation of the expression of different ERAD components such as EDEM3, CANX, DNAJC10, SEL1L, VCP and different components of ubiquitin ligase complex in MPN samples, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f005">Figure 5</xref>E.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-cancers-11-01921"><title>2.5. Identification of a Network Involved in the ERAD-Dependent Degradation of CALR Variants</title><p>We then collated all the information gathered in our siRNA screen, the available databases, and the literature. This identified a CALR closed network containing the EDEM proteins, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, blue nodes, the CALR homolog CANX, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, orange node, and the thioredoxin domain containing proteins DNAJC10 and TXNDC11 [<xref rid="B27-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, green nodes. Based on this, we first tested whether siRNA-mediated silencing of TXNDC11 impacted on the expression of CALR mutants. This showed that TXNDC11 expression attenuation led to a stabilization of both del52 and ins5 variants, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>B. As such, together with the results obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f005">Figure 5</xref>, this shows that specific thioredoxin domain containing proteins might be involved in the degradation of CALR variants, with a preferential impact on the ins5 mutant. Since EDEM3 silencing was found to stabilize both del52 and ins5 variants, we then tested whether these proteins could be found in a complex. Coimmunoprecipitations studies showed that the del52 and ins5 variants were more prone to be found in EDEM3-containing complexes than the WT CALR, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>C. To follow up on the CALR network identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, we monitored the presence of complexes comprising both CANX and CALR, and evaluated whether the expression of EDEM1 or EDEM3 might impact on those complexes. This showed that overexpression of EDEM1 selectively stabilized a del52 CALR/CANX complex, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>D, whereas the overexpression of EDEM3 did not significantly impact on the formation of mutant CALR/CANX complexes, but increased the WT CALR/CANX complex, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f006">Figure 6</xref>E. These results show that the expression of CALR variants is dependent on a proximal ER quality control system, most likely including EDEM3, TXNDC11, and DNAJC10, which, when deregulated in MPN, might lead to sufficient stabilization of the proteins to yield constitutive MPL activation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-cancers-11-01921"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have determined the impact of the expression of CALR variants on the ER homeostasis and investigated the underlying mechanisms involved in their observed low expression level. We showed that expression of CALR mutant proteins associated with MPN does not trigger an ER stress. These results were unexpected given that it was recently deduced from transcriptomic data that ER homeostasis was perturbed in CALR variant-expressing MPN [<xref rid="B28-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, our data suggest that this UPR pathway activation is not a direct consequence of the expression of CALR mutant proteins. On the contrary, it might result from the modification of cell properties, such as an increased proliferation, as suggested by a more predominant activation of the UPR in committed progenitors compared to hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) [<xref rid="B29-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Salati et al. recently reported a decreased sensitivity toward ER-stress induced apoptosis in cells expressing CALR variants [<xref rid="B30-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, these results were obtained in K562 cells that do not express MPL and the proliferation of which is not dependent on cytokines. In contrast, we observed in two different cell lines with megakaryocytic features (including MPL expression) that cells expressing the CALR variant proteins are as sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis as cells expressing the WT CALR, which is consistent with the absence of benefit of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the treatment of PMF patients, a molecule known to trigger cell apoptosis through induction of an ER-stress [<xref rid="B31-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of ER adaptive signaling may not be a major determinant of the pathophysiology of <italic>CALR</italic> mutated-MPN oncogenesis. However, we cannot rule out an involvement of ER stress in different aspects not assessed in this study or restricted to specific cell populations. Of note, the ER stress in HSC has been associated with a priming toward megakaryocytic lineage [<xref rid="B29-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, the activation of the UPR in HSC could result in a preferential differentiation of HSC into megakaryocytes, as previously suggested [<xref rid="B33-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. </p><p>The low expression level of CALR mutant proteins compared to their WT counterpart was previously reported in numerous studies [<xref rid="B18-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have generally not been addressed. Other groups have reported a secretion of CALR variant proteins in the extracellular medium [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B34-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In these studies, as in ours, CALR variants were detectable in the extracellular medium while the WT form was absent, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. However, the amount of mutant proteins in the cell supernatants seemed too low to explain the difference of expression level between WT and mutant proteins in the cell lysates. Moreover, Sollazzo et al. observed a similar level of plasmatic CALR between <italic>JAK2</italic>- and <italic>CALR</italic>-mutated MPN patients [<xref rid="B36-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], suggesting that the secretion of mutant CALR proteins is not massive. Accordingly, when using the Myc-6His tagged forms of CALR, we detected significant amounts of WT CALR in the extracellular medium, probably because the Myc-6His tag prevented the ER-retention by the KDEL motif. However, this leakage was not sufficient to significantly decrease the expression level of CALR WT protein. This prompted us to search for other mechanisms that would be combined to the secretion of mutant CALR proteins to explain their faint expression. Interestingly the treatment of various cell lines with two different proteasome inhibitors (MG-132 and Lactacystin) revealed that these variant proteins were stabilized, and thus that they may be subjected to degradation via the ERAD-proteasome pathway. This process is not the consequence of the presence of a tag on the C-terminal end of the proteins, since 1) increased level of CALR variants was observed after MG132 treatment in another study using N-terminal tagged forms of CALR [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; 2) we confirmed a low expression level of endogenous mutant CALR in primary patients&#x02019; cells; and 3) a similar degradation process was monitored after transfection of nontagged mutant proteins in HEK293T, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01921-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B. Inhibition of autophagy showed moderate effects on mutant CALR proteins&#x02019; expression and discrepancies were noticed depending on the drug and the cell line. Moreover, we did not notice a robust and reproducible additive effect of autophagy and proteasome inhibition over proteasome inhibition alone, suggesting a limited role of autophagy in CALR variants&#x02019; clearance. In these conditions, one might postulate that the contribution of autophagy could be restricted to situations where the ERAD pathway is saturated, as previously shown in other models [<xref rid="B37-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the CALR variants are the first example of oncogenic proteins subjected to a major degradation mechanism. This phenomenon could be due to a toxic gain-of-function of the mutants when present in excess amount. This is supported by the fact that <italic>CALR</italic> mutations are exceptionally homozygous [<xref rid="B7-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, the generation of <italic>CALR</italic> mutations by the CRISPR technology in conditions of cytokine deprivation results in predominantly heterozygous mutations [<xref rid="B38-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As a consequence, it can be hypothesized that the gain of pro-oncogenic functions associated with CALR variants must occur at concentrations of the variants that exhibit low toxicity and thus might be extremely dependent on the mechanisms controlling the expression level of those variants.</p><p>The features allowing the recognition of CALR variants as ERAD substrates are not known. Mammalian CALR protein presents a single N-glycosylation site, but an effective glycosylation is detected only under stress conditions [<xref rid="B39-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is not surprising that glycan motifs may not be involved in the degradation process of CALR variants as suggested by the absence of effect of glucosidase and mannosidase inhibition (using both pharmacological and genetic tools). However, it can be hypothesized that the recognition involves the C-terminal sequence common to all CALR variants and/or the conformational changes this might induce. Indeed, the degradation mechanisms are observed for both the &#x0201c;long deletion&#x0201d; (such as del52) and small insertion (such as ins5) variants. Moreover, the deletion of all or a part of the last 36 amino-acids results in an increased expression of the variant proteins [<xref rid="B22-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B40-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The siRNA screen carried out in this study showed that CALR variant degradation does not involve the classical ERAD machinery for soluble ER luminal glycoproteins (i.e., OS-9, XTP3-B, SEL1L, HRD1). Moreover, DBeQ failed at increasing expression levels of mutated CALR suggesting that the AAA+ ATPase p97 may not be an actor of CALR variants disposal, even though involved in the degradation of a large variety of ERAD substrates [<xref rid="B41-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, we highlighted EDEM3 as a key component in mutant CALR degradation pathway. Moreover, the absence of effect of kifunensine treatment suggests that EDEM-associated potential mannosidase activity is dispensable for this process. Concordantly, the knock-down of EDEM2 acting upstream of EDEM3 in mannose chain trimming [<xref rid="B42-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] has no effect on the expression level of del52 and ins5 mutants. EDEM3, like other members of the EDEM family, has previously been shown to interact with nonglycosylated substrates [<xref rid="B43-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, its role in the degradation of proteins has been limited to glycosylated substrates thus far. The identity of possible other factors involved in CALR mutated protein disposal remains to be determined, but our observations confirm the existence of a specific equipment dedicated to the degradation of nonglycosylated substrates, as previously suggested [<xref rid="B44-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. </p><p>Interestingly, we found that the expression of ERAD genes was selectively altered in <italic>CALR</italic> variants expressing MPN using existing datasets [<xref rid="B26-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], thus confirming a pathophysiological link between ERAD and CALR variants. This concept was reinforced by the presence of complexes containing CALR variants and selective ER quality control and ERAD components. A recent study also described an increased interaction of mutant CALR proteins with Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control (ERQC) actors [<xref rid="B45-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As such, one might propose a model in which the combined expression of CALR variants and an altered ERAD network might concur with the development of a myeloproliferative phenotype. In such a model, a strategy aiming at restoring the properties of the altered ERAD pathway might in turn promote the degradation of CALR variants and decrease the pro-oncogenic burden. In particular, modulating the expression of EDEM proteins influences the binding of CALR proteins to CANX. Because the release of ERAD substrates from CANX represents the first step of the degradation process, disturbing the balance in the EDEM protein family could impact the clearance of the CALR mutant proteins. At present, the specific deregulation of ERAD in MPN needs to be further characterized in order to identify the pharmacological compounds susceptible to being active in such a context. Because such a strategy has shown benefits in neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="B46-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-cancers-11-01921" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], modulating the degradation of CALR mutant proteins by the ERAD-proteasome pathway might represent an appealing strategy to improve the management of <italic>CALR</italic>-mutated MPN.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-cancers-11-01921"><title>4.

Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blotting</title><p>Cell lysates obtained following lysis with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5% CHAPS, protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete) were clarified by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitating anti-Myc antibodies were incubated overnight and collected using protein G-coupled magnetic beads washed extensively using lysis buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates or cell lysates resuspended in Laemmli buffer or Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) were resolved by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in order to load equal quantity of proteins diluted in the same volume. Proteins were then transferred to PolyVinyliDene Fluoride (PVDF) membranes using the Transblot Turbo system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and appropriate Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were detected via chemoluminescence with a LAS-3000 Camera (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) or Amersham Hyperfilm MP autoradiography films (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). When quantification was performed (using ImageJ software), only data obtained with the camera were used, allowing a larger linear range and the detection of saturated signal. Secreted proteins were precipitated from conditioned media with trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v). The pellets were then washed twice with 80% acetone and resuspended in Laemmli buffer before analysis by Western blot.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-cancers-11-01921"><title>4.6.

Conclusions</title><p>The expression of CALR mutant proteins does not significantly disturb ER homeostasis, nor impact ER stress-induced apoptosis. These proteins are faintly expressed due to a secretion into the extracellular medium combined with a degradation mediated mainly by the ERAD-proteasome pathway. This latter phenomenon involves a network a proximal ERAD actors, especially proteins of the EDEM family. Modulation of the activity of this network could represent a therapeutic option to counter the oncogenic activity of CALR mutant proteins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Valerie De luca and Vincent Pitard for technical assistance with Flow cytometry (CNRS UMS 3427, INSERM US 005, Univ.

(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T were transfected with pcDNA6 plasmids to express Myc-6His tagged wild type (WT) or mutant CALR proteins. Forty-eight hours later, endogenous WT CALR expression was assessed by western blotting using the antitotal CALR antibody. Actin was used as a loading control. Note that because of the presence of the tag, the CALR proteins present with an increased apparent molecular weight (MW) compared to the nontagged forms. Hence, WT and ins5 proteins (black arrowhead) present a MW superior to the endogenous nontagged WT CALR protein (white arrowhead), while the tagged form of del52 protein (the Molecular Weight of which is lower than that of WT and ins5) present the same MW as the WT endogenous protein. (<bold>B</bold>) The expression of endogenous CALR was quantified and expressed as the ratio of CALR to actin signal and normalized against the &#x0201c;empty vector&#x0201d; (EV) condition. For Myc-6His tagged del52 mutant CALR (which presents the same MW as the endogenous CALR) a correction was applied by subtracting the signal generated by the transgene estimated from the comparison of the signal measured for WT and ins5 CALR with anti-Myc and anti-CALR antibodies. Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM) of three independent experiments.
