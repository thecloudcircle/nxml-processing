The disease is characterized by weakness and wasting of the distal limb muscles leading to progressive motor impairment, sensory loss, and skeletal deformities. CMT patients typically develop slowly progressive disability early in life, while there is no causal treatment available.</p><p id="Par4">CMT is one of the most heterogeneous Mendelian disorders, with causal mutations in over 80 genes known so far. Notably, CMT gene products are implicated in diverse cellular pathways and their function related to the disease is not always apparent. A prominent example are aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs). With six members involved, they represent the largest family of proteins implicated in the etiology of peripheral neuropathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. aaRSs are ubiquitously expressed enzymes catalyzing the charging of tRNAs with their cognate amino acids and are therefore indispensable for viability. The specific sub-population of neurons affected in CMT sharply contrasts with the broad requirement of aaRSs for protein biosynthesis, indicating that the impact of aaRSs in peripheral nerves may not be limited to protein translation.</p><p id="Par5">In addition to their well characterized localization in the cytoplasm, aaRSs are detected in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. While the early hypothesis was that nuclear aaRSs function in proofreading newly-synthesized tRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, later findings suggest that they are involved in regulating a wide range of biological processes including vascular development, inflammation, and stress responses mainly due to their peculiar abilities to interact with the transcriptional machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, we identified the nuclear localization signal in human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS or YARS) and demonstrated its presence in the nucleus under oxidative stress to transcriptionally upregulate the expression of DNA damage response genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Overexpression of TyrRS strongly protects against UV-induced DNA damage in zebrafish, whereas restricting TyrRS nuclear entry abolishes this effect. The beneficial effect of nuclear TyrRS is mediated by activating the transcription factor E2F1.</p><p id="Par6">Notably, TyrRS is one of the aaRSs causally linked to CMT disease. Five pathogenic dominant mutations have been reported so far, all of them located in the catalytic domain of the enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Three have been extensively characterized both in vitro and in vivo and the results show that a defect in aminoacylation activity is not a shared property (i.e., TyrRS-G41R is enzymatically inactive, while TyrRS-E196K is fully active, and TyrRS-&#x00394;153-156VKQV has partial activity), suggesting that a simple loss of canonical function is not a prerequisite for the disease to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Pathogenicity of these three mutations has been recapitulated in transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> models displaying progressive loss of motor abilities, electrophysiological neuronal dysfunction, and terminal axonal degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Flies expressing the enzymatically intact TyrRS-E196K mutant show comparable or, in some aspects, more pronounced features of neurodegeneration than flies expressing the aminoacylation compromised mutants, therefore indicating that a gain of toxic function or interference with a non-enzymatic function of the wild type (WT) protein is likely underlying the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we set out to investigate how this neurotoxic function is generated from a molecular perspective. Because neuronal identity and maintenance are largely controlled by transcriptionally regulated programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we further investigated whether the nuclear localization and function of TyrRS plays any role in the disease mechanism of CMT. We show that CMT-causing mutations in TyrRS induce unique conformational changes, provoking aberrant interactions. These interactions in the nucleus lead to transcription factor E2F1 hyperactivation. Furthermore, a broad transcriptional regulation network associated with wild-type TyrRS expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is disturbed when a CMT-mutant is expressed. Excluding mutant TyrRS from the nucleus using pharmacological and genetic approaches suppresses the CMT hallmark phenotypes of CMT in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. These data highlight that TyrRS may contribute to transcriptional regulation in neurons, and suggest a therapeutic strategy for CMT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conformational changes and altered functionalities of TyrRS</title><p id="Par8">In a previous work, we demonstrated that the three established CMT-causing TyrRS mutants (TyrRS-E196K, TyrRS-G41R, and TyrRS-&#x00394;153-156VKQV) induce a conformational opening and expose a consensus area in the catalytic domain of the enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). In order to link this unique structural change to specific interactional and functional consequences related to CMT, we included two control mutants in this study. An alternative conformational change can be induced by a rationally designed mutation in the anticodon binding domain (Y341A) to expose a different area of the catalytic domain that is responsible for a &#x0201c;cytokine&#x0201d;-like activity of TyrRS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Separately, an established benign polymorphism in the anticodon binding domain (K265N) was included, because it shows no toxicity of the protein in human or when overexpressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and we found that it does not trigger any conformational change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>TyrRS mutations induce structural changes leading to aberrant transcription regulation. <bold>a</bold> Domain structure of human TyrRS and the location of the different mutations.

Together, they form a complex with the deacetylase HDAC1 in order to regulate the acetylation level and activity of transcription factors such as E2F1 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). To evaluate how different structural perturbations affect the TyrRS-TRIM28 interaction, we co-expressed the neurotoxic TyrRS mutants (TyrRS-E196K, TyrRS-G41R, and TyrRS-&#x00394;153-156VKQV) or the controls (TyrRS-WT, TyrRS-K265N, and TyrRS-Y341A), together with TRIM28 in HEK293T cells. Our previous studies have suggested that the nuclear localization of TyrRS and its response to oxidative stress are shared among different cell types including HEK293T and motor neuron cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Immunoprecipitation of TRIM28 revealed co-purification of TyrRS-WT as expected. The CMT-causing mutations enhanced the cellular TyrRS-TRIM28 and TyrRS-HDAC1 interactions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). In contrast, the TyrRS-Y341A mutation resulted in a reduction of the TyrRS-TRIM28/HDAC1 binding, consistent with our previous finding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, while the benign mutation had no effect on the binding properties, just like the TyrRS-WT protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). These results demonstrate that the CMT-causing mutants have specific binding properties due to its unique conformational change. We also evaluated the TyrRS-TRIM28 interaction in CMT patient derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that express the mutant protein in the patients&#x02019; unique genetic background. The TyrRS-TRIM28 interaction does appear to be stronger in CMT patients&#x02019; PBMCs endogenously expressing either TyrRS-E196K or TyrRS-G41R mutant alleles (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>,<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media"> c</xref>). However, the increase did not convey statistical significance given the small number of patient samples available.</p><p id="Par10">Next, we tested if the strengthened TyrRS-TRIM28 interaction would affect the TRIM28/HDAC1 complex to bind its substrate transcription factors (e.g., E2F1) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Indeed, a reduced TRIM28-E2F1 interaction was concurrent with the enhanced TyrRS-TRIM28 interaction in HEK293T cells expressing each of the three neurotoxic TyrRS alleles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). As a result, E2F1 was alleviated from deacetylation by HDAC1, and E2F1 acetylation levels were increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Contrarily, the TRIM28-E2F1 interaction was enhanced in cells expressing TyrRS-Y341A, leading to a decrease in E2F1 acetylation, while we observed no alterations when the K265N variant was expressed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). These data further demonstrate that the uniquely altered binding properties of CMT mutants have a specific functional impact on their interacting partners.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CMT-causing mutant TyrRS overactivates E2F1</title><p id="Par11">Acetylation of E2F1 leads to its activation in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We examined the downstream effect of mutant TyrRS on four E2F1 transcriptional targets sensitive to nuclear TyrRS (<italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>RAD51</italic>, <italic>RAD51L1</italic>, <italic>RAD9A</italic>) in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. RT-qPCR analysis in HEK293T cells revealed upregulation of these genes in response to TyrRS-E196K overexpression, which was significantly higher than the response to TyrRS-WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Likewise, we observed a significant increase in E2F1-regulated transcription in CMT patients&#x02019; PBMCs endogenously expressing mutant TyrRS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). This upregulation was not due to differences in TyrRS nuclear occupancy, as both HEK293T cells expressing TyrRS-WT or any of the three CMT mutants (G41R, &#x00394;153-156VKQV, E196K), and patient derived PBMCs showed comparable presence of the protein in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). Thus, via their aberrant interaction properties, CMT-causing mutants behave as hypermorphs regarding their effect on E2F1 activity in mammalian cells.</p><p id="Par12">Next, we explored the relevance of TyrRS-mediated E2F1 overactivation in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model for CMT. High expression of TyrRS-E196K in the retina of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> driver) is toxic and induces a mild rough eye phenotype. In contrast, low expression of TyrRS-WT or TyrRS-E196K shows no retinal disorganization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#x02013;c</xref>), but serves as a sensitized background for testing TyrRS-genetic interactors. Expression of the fly orthologue of E2F1 (dE2F1), or its co-factor Dp alone, together with either TyrRS transgene had no effect on the retinal morphology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d&#x02013;i</xref>). However, overexpression of dE2F1 together with Dp induced a rough eye on its own, which remained unaltered in the presence of TyrRS-WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j, k</xref>).

These results strongly suggest that the GF phenotypes caused by TyrRS-&#x02206;153-156 require its nuclear localization, further supporting that CMT pathology is associated with a dysfunction of mutant TyrRS in the nucleus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms behind the largest protein family linked to CMT, the most common hereditary neuromuscular disorder, imposes a major challenge for both the neuropathy and the tRNA synthetase fields. We and others extensively studied in vitro and in vivo the canonical enzymatic function of aaRSs in relation to CMT and excluded a loss-of-function disease mechanism, at least for two of them (glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) and TyrRS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although it becomes more and more clear that mutations in these genes cause CMT phenotypes through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, the molecular and functional aspects of this mechanism remain elusive.</p><p id="Par25">Using a bottom up approach, this study stemmed from our previous understanding of the unique structural changes induced by the CMT-causing mutations in TyrRS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and of a role of TyrRS in transcriptional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We searched for functional changes in mutant TyrRS that are relevant to the disease. We took advantage of having a spectrum of TyrRS variants to build a structure-function relationship that specifically links the unique conformation of the CMT mutants to functional consequences relevant to the neuropathy. These mutations ranged from a rationally designed substitution, through a naturally occurring polymorphism, to CMT-causing mutations. To this end, we established the mechanism of hyperactivation of E2F1 due to aberrant mutant TyrRS interactions and corroborated our findings in patient biosamples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a-c</xref>). However, the ultimate test for the key involvement of this TF in the pathology would come from a disease rescue in an animal model. Targeting E2F1 reduced the toxicity of TyrRS-E196K but was not sufficient in alleviating the motor deficit of the fly CMT model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2n, o</xref>). Inspired by our transcriptome analysis, which confirmed the involvement of E2F1 but also revealed a much broader transcriptional dysregulation in mutant flies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we attempted to target TyrRS nuclear localization and achieved a greater success in reducing toxicity and in alleviating motor deficit (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>). Remarkably, using a genetic approach to prevent mutant TyrRS from entering the nucleus, we achieved a complete rescue at morphological, behavioral, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic levels altogether (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), therefore we unequivocally demonstrated the relevance of the nucleus in TyrRS-linked CMT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We should point out that although targeting E2F1 alone was not sufficient in rescuing the CMT phenotypes, the molecular mechanism we obtained for E2F1 activation by mutant TyrRS provides a clear proof of concept for how the CMT mutants could affect the function of other transcription factors (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of the proposed TyrRS mode of action. TyrRS enters the nucleus and engages with different interaction partners, including transcription factors. CMT-causing mutations do not affect the nuclear translocation of TyrRS. However, when the mutant protein enters the nucleus, these interactions are enhanced or perturbed and new interactions may be formed, leading to dysregulation of the transcriptional machinery. As demonstrated in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, the dysregulation can be alleviated by inhibiting the nuclear entry of TyrRS pharmacologically or genetically</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2019_12909_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e1592"/></fig></p><p id="Par26">We note that although the overexpression of WT TyrRS does not cause CMT phenotypes in the fly model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the overexpression itself is also associated with extensive transcriptional reprograming (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting that this aaRS is a master regulator of gene transcription in the nucleus. Possibly, the WT TyrRS acts through regulating multiple TFs in a coordinated and balanced manner, yet such balance is disrupted by the CMT mutations. The disruption likely has a hypermorphic component as illustrated by E2F1 hyperactivation and a neomorphic component as suggested by the TFs predicted to be regulated by mutant TyrRS alone (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). From a structural perspective, the unique conformational change (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) enhances the capacity of CMT-causing TyrRS mutants to interact with transcription regulators, including but should not be limited to TRIM28 and HDAC1, leading to a change in their functional properties and ultimately triggering a broad dysregulation of gene expression.</p><p id="Par27">The demonstration of nuclear involvement in TyrRS-induced CMT could have important implications for other aaRSs associated with CMT, as all aaRSs were described to localize to the nucleus of the cell and at least two other CMT-linked aaRSs (i.e., MetRS and AlaRS) have known functions in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Interestingly, common genetic modifiers with nuclear localization were found in our previous fly-based screens for CMT-associated mutant GlyRS and TyrRS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This study is facilitated by extensive existing knowledge on the TyrRS system, such as the location of the NLS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and the acetylation-mediated TyrRS nuclear import<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, most of this kind of knowledge is lacking for the other CMT-linked aaRS, hindering the evaluation of their possible nuclear involvement at the moment.</p><p id="Par28">Previous works showed that CMT mutations in GlyRS could induce aberrant interactions with ectodomains of membrane receptors (e.g., Nrp1) and intracellular proteins, thereby interfering with proper signaling, as well as trafficking in motor and sensory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Although we saw a complete rescue of disease-relevant phenotypes in the fly by preventing nuclear entry of the mutant TyrRS, we cannot rule out the involvement of other cellular compartments or additional mechanisms in TyrRS-linked CMT. We did confirm, however, that the &#x00394;NLS mutation introduced to TyrRS did not affect the distribution of the protein (WT or E196K) to the extracellular space (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>) and that the embelin treatment did not affect the secretion of TyrRS (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>). Therefore, we excluded the possibility that an altered secretion profile of mutant TyrRS contributed to the genetic and the pharmacological rescue of phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Possibly, the molecules mediating the toxicities outside the nucleus are not as conserved as the mediators inside the nucleus between flies and humans. For example, in contrast to E2F1, there is no direct ortholog of mammalian Nrp1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Developing a mammalian model for TyrRS-linked CMT would facilitate the evaluation of other potential mechanisms in the future.</p><p id="Par29">As illustrated by the studies on GlyRS-linked CMT and by the network of genes and transcription factors identified in our transcriptome analysis for the mutant TyrRS, aaRS-linked CMT is likely a result of the interplay of multiple molecular pathways&#x02014;some of them active in the WT condition but dysregulated by the aberrant binding properties of the mutant, while others unique to the mutants alone&#x02014;and therefore the design of a successful therapeutic approach in the future should be tailored to the pleiotropic mutational impact. <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be used to test the therapeutic potential of small molecule compounds in a high-throughput manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Excitingly, the pharmacological inhibition of TyrRS from entering the nucleus using the PCAF inhibitor embelin mimicked the effect of the genetic restriction and rescued specific disease features in the CMT fly, showing for the first time a successful therapeutic intervention for TyrRS-induced peripheral neuropathy. Although further improvements on drug selection, delivery, and efficacy should be investigated, this work paves the way for developing a viable therapy for CMT patients affected by TyrRS mutations through regulating nuclear trafficking of the translation factor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="Par30">We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research.

The iRegulon plugin in Cytoscape was used to detect the transcription factors the targets, and the motifs/tracks associated with the differentially expressed genes.</p><p id="Par51">To calculate and draw custom Venn diagrams the following online tool was used: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/</ext-link>. The representation factor (RF) is the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent groups. A representation factor &#x0003e;1 indicates more overlap than expected of two independent groups, a representation factor &#x0003c;1 indicates less overlap than expected, and a representation factor of 1 indicates that the two groups by the number of genes expected for independent groups of genes. The probability of finding a certain amount of overlapping genes was calculated using the hypergeometric probability formula.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Secretion assay</title><p id="Par52">HEK293T cells were cultured to 70% confluency and then transfected with V5-tagged TyrRS or GlyRS constructs. For experiments to test the effect of embelin on secretion, different doses of Embelin or the solvent control (DMSO) were added into the cell culture medium 30&#x02009;h after transfection. Cell culture medium was collected 36&#x02009;h after transfection and then concentrated to 1&#x02009;ml by passing through EMD Millipore Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore Sigma). The secreted TyrRS or GlyRS in the concentrated medium was pulled down by immunoprecipitation by the V5 antibody and then detected by Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Statistics</title><p id="Par53">Measurements were taken from independent samples.
