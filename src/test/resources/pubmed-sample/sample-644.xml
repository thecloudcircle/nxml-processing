For example, a major portion of posterior cortex is concerned primarily with vision and is divided into discrete visual areas, &#x0003e;20 areas in primates [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and ~15 in the mouse [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Visual areas are arranged into a hierarchy and serve different functions in the processing of visual information [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and yet the sizes and shapes of visual areas appear to vary across individuals of a given species. In mice for example, maps of visual cortex consist of a stereotyped collection of visual areas, in approximately the same relative locations in each mouse, but the relative positions of areas and in their sizes and shapes appear to differ substantially between mice. Such differences in the organization of cortex might affect the processing of visual information across mice. How much variation is there in the locations, sizes and shapes of cortical areas from mouse to mouse?</p><p>Only a few studies describe differences in the size, shape and locations of cortical areas across a population of individuals. Differences have been described in the size and shape of primary visual cortex in humans, macaques, cats, rats and mice, the consensus being that V1 differs in size more than in shape [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Necessarily, comparisons were across small numbers (&#x0003c;25) of individuals and no attempt was made to determine whether the differences resulted from differing organization of cortex across individuals (biological variation) or simply measurement error (noise). Separating biological variation from measurement noise requires statistical analysis of measurements from large numbers of animals. To our knowledge, nobody has assessed biological variation (after separation from measurement noise) of any cortical area in any species.</p><p>In our previous work, we noted that retinotopic maps of cortical visual areas differed between mice [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but did not quantify these differences or determine the relative contributions of biological variation and measurement noise. Here we quantify the variability in size, shape and locations of cortical visual areas in the mouse</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec002"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Retinotopic maps differ across mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213924.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The differences between maps presumably include biological variation and inaccuracies, or measurement noise in the mapping process. Under the assumption that the retinotopic map is invariant in an individual, repeated map generation from a mouse will result in maps that differ only because of measurement noise. This assumption provides a method to isolate biological variation, given maps from a large enough collection of mice and two or more maps from each mouse. From such a data set, one can estimate (1) the effects of measurement noise, by comparing retinotopic maps across mapping sessions in each mouse, and (2) the combined effects of biological variability and measurement noise, by comparing retinotopic maps across mice. A second assumption, that measurement noise and biological variation are independent, permits the isolation of biological variation by subtraction of the variance of the between-session comparisons from the variance of the between-mouse comparisons. Implicitly, a third assumption is made: that there are no additional sources of measurement noise when comparing maps across mice, relative to the comparison across mapping sessions.</p><p>We generated retinotopic maps for 60 adult mice by intrinsic signal imaging [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Each mouse was imaged twice, 11&#x02013;121 days apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213924.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As in our previous publication [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], retinotopy was displayed using the visual field sign [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and field sign maps were segmented into retinotopically-defined cortical areas using a numerical routine [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Consistent with our previous paper [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there was an almost continuous ring of field sign positive regions around V1 and the lateral retinotopic border of V1 was ~300 &#x003bc;m medial to the 3D Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213924.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Biological variation in the locations of visual areas</title><p>To test for biological variation in the locations of visual areas, we compared maps across mice and across imaging sessions. We reduced each map to a set of points, each point representing the centroid of a field sign patch and made pairwise comparisons of maps. As a measure of the difference between each pair of maps, we calculated the paired patch distance (ppd; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213924.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). From 60 mice, two imaging sessions per mouse, we made 60 pairwise comparisons across sessions (one per mouse) and 59 * 60 = 3540 pairwise comparisons across mice. For each pair of maps, we defined paired patch distance as the mean of the distances between corresponding field sign patches:

Mouse-to-mouse and session-to-session distributions were significantly different (p = 4.6 x 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test), with mouse-to-mouse differences being greater than session-to-session differences. We conclude that there is biological variation in the retinotopic map.</p><p>For each pairwise comparison of maps, one map could be translated relative to the other, or rotated, scaled or the relative locations of visual areas might differ. Any combination of these four transformations might be the source of the observed biological variability. In addition, inaccuracies in our alignment process might generate translation and rotation errors that differ between mouse-to-mouse and session-to-session comparisons and therefore be interpreted, erroneously, as biological variation. To separate differences in translation, rotation, scale and shape (shape, in this context, is the relative locations of patches), we adopted Procrustes superimposition, an analytical approach used to compare shapes in biological populations [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The approach involves the sequential estimation and removal of translation, rotation and scaling to leave differences in only the locations of patches.</p><p>Across maps, the centroid of V1 moved by up to 1 mm in m-l and a-p axes. As might be expected, the distributions of mouse-to-mouse and session-to-session differences were different for V1 centroid locations in both a-p and m-l axes (p = 9.0 x 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> and 5.1 x 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> respectively, Levene&#x02019;s test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213924.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). As a measure of the scale of each retinotopic map we calculated a statistic we call the &#x02018;centroid size&#x02019; from the centroids of areas V1, RL and PM, all three of which were in every field sign map. Centroid size is the square root of the summed squared distances of each landmark from the centroid [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Mean centroid size was 1.46 mm, with centroid sizes being approximately normally distributed about this mean, most within ~20% of the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213924.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

The distributions were significantly different for V1, which was also the patch with the least biological variation in size, with a standard deviation of 16%. Hence in 50% of mice, V1 is &#x0003e;11% smaller or larger than average and in 5% of mice, V1 is &#x0003e;32% smaller or larger than average. For the other patches, mouse-to-mouse distributions were not significantly different from session-to-session differences (each p &#x0003e; 0.05/11, Levene&#x02019;s test with Bonferroni correction) and we can be less confident that there was biological variation in the sizes of the other patches, but the fact that the variance of the mouse-to-mouse distribution was greater than the variance of the session-to-session differences for almost all the patches suggests that there&#x02019;s biological variation in size for many of them. Although measurement noise was the main source of variability in patch size, biological variation was also substantial at 16&#x02013;56% of the area of the mean patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213924.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

Jaccard index ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (identical shapes). We calculated differences pairwise for mouse-to-mouse and for session-to-session comparisons, resulting in mouse-to-mouse and session-to-session distributions of the Jaccard index for each patch. The median Jaccard indices of mouse-to-mouse and session-to-session distributions were similar for all patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213924.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and there was no patch for which the means of the two distributions differed significantly (each p &#x0003e; 0.05 / 11, Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction). Consistent with this conclusion, plots of the cumulative mouse-to-mouse and session-to-session differences were similar (V1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213924.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), with no indication that mouse-to-mouse differences were greater than session-to-session differences in patch shape. Hence we find no evidence for biological variation in the shapes of visual areas, the apparent variability across mice resulting from measurement noise. This result makes a strong statement about the reliability of border positions in maps based on intrinsic imaging. The reproducibility of these maps is poor, even with extensive averaging, likely because the signal-to-noise ratio of intrinsic imaging is low. One might interpret the resulting border positions as approximate. In contrast, border locations mapped with GCaMP6 indicators, an approach which can offer a higher signal-to-noise ratio than intrinsic imaging, can be accurate to within tens of micrometers [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0213924.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0213924.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Biological variation in the shapes of field sign patches.</title><p>(A) Median of the distribution of the Jaccard Indices for mouse-to-mouse and session-to-session comparisons, for each patch.

Might some other mouse-to-mouse difference have been classified as biological variation? Alignment errors are a concern, but our results show no evidence of such alignment effects and the resulting errors would likely affect the locations of visual areas and have little effect on their sizes. Hence alignment errors are unlikely to account for the observed biological variation in the sizes of visual areas. Mouse-to-mouse differences in the segmentation of field sign patches, arising from differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying images, might contribute to the biological variation in size of patches. We expect the effect to be greater for peripheral patches (patch P, for example) than for V1 and other patches near the core of the map.</p><p>In summary, we assessed biological variation in the sizes, shapes and locations of field sign patches in visual cortex of the mouse. Our results provide no evidence for biological variation in the shapes of visual areas and evidence of only modest biological variation in location, but the sizes of visual areas differed substantially between mice, with the area of the average region varying ~2-fold across the population of mice. We were surprised by this result. We reasoned that there is some minimum amount of cortical tissue required for each visual area to perform its functions and likely sufficient, but not excess cortex is allocated to each visual area. If the functions of each visual area are invariant across mice, it seems likely that the required volume of cortex for each visual area is similar across mice. Hence our expectation was that there might be variability in the locations and shapes of visual areas, but that size would be more constrained. Our results are not consistent with this expectation, raising the possibility the roles of visual areas in the processing of visual information is more flexible than we had appreciated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>Retinotopic maps were generated from 60 mice of 7 genotypes: 20 Cux2-CreERT2;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice, 5 Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice, 1 Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 mouse, 7 Nr5a1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice, 10 Rbp4-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice, 11 Rorb-IRES2-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice and 6 Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice.</p><p>Mice were crosses of the following lines:</p><p>Cux2-CreERT2 [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/sds.php?mmrrc_id=32779">https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/sds.php?mmrrc_id=32779</ext-link>).</p><p>Emx1-IRES-Cre: B6.129S2-Emx1tm1(cre)Krj/J [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/005628">https://www.jax.org/strain/005628</ext-link>)</p><p>Nr5a1-Cre [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/sds.php?mmrrc_id=34276">https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/sds.php?mmrrc_id=34276</ext-link></p><p>Rbp4-Cre_KL100 [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/sds.php?mmrrc_id=31125">https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/sds.php?mmrrc_id=31125</ext-link></p><p>Rorb-IRES2-Cre [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/023526">https://www.jax.org/strain/023526</ext-link></p><p>Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/009613">https://www.jax.org/strain/009613</ext-link></p><p>CaMK2a-tTA: B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-tTA)1Mmay/DboJ [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/007004">https://www.jax.org/strain/007004</ext-link></p><p>Ai93: B6;129S6-Igs7<sup>tm93.1(tetO-GCaMP6f)Hze</sup>/J [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/024103">https://www.jax.org/strain/024103</ext-link></p><p>Ai94: B6.Cg-<italic>Igs7</italic><sup><italic>tm94</italic>.<italic>1(tetO-GCaMP6s)Hze</italic></sup>/J [<xref rid="pone.0213924.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/024104">https://www.jax.org/strain/024104</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Retinotopic mapping and identification of visual areas</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

We normalized the size of each map using the centroids of patches V1, RL and PM since these three patches were identified in every map. These three centroids form a triangle and we scaled each map such that the circumference of this triangle equaled one.
