In addition to being the end product of glycolysis, pyruvate is an essential carbon distribution point to oxidative metabolism, amino acid and fatty acid syntheses, and overflow metabolite production. Hence, a tight regulation of pyruvate kinase (Pyk) activity is of great importance. This study aimed to analyze targeted metabolites from several pathways and possible changes in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> lacking Pyk. Wild type and &#x00394;pyk cells were cultivated in chemically defined medium with glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources, and the extracted metabolites were analyzed by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, GC-MS, HPLC-MS, and LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the perturbation created in the pyruvate node drove an adaptation to new conditions by altering the nutritional compounds&#x02019; consumption. In &#x00394;pyk, pyruvate, which is subject to glucose-dependent carbon catabolite repression, did not comply with the hierarchy in carbon source utilization. Other metabolic alterations were observed such as the higher secretion of the overflow metabolites acetoin and 2,3-butanediol by &#x00394;pyk.

Introduction</title><p>The bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is ubiquitous in nature, living primarily in the soil and associated with water sources, and can successfully adapt to changes in the environment [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Being the best characterized member of Gram-positive bacteria, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is currently the focus of interest in biotechnology and industry due to its easy genetic manipulation, the availability of extensive physiological and biochemical data, and due to being an efficient producer of economically valuable metabolites [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this context, knowledge of metabolomic flux pathways and, consequently, improved strategies for the overproduction of desired metabolites have made <italic>B. subtilis</italic> a potent applicant organism in a wide industrial field. Pyruvate is a key intermediate of various central carbon metabolism pathways, acting as a branching point of glycolysis and tricarboxylic cycle (TCA cycle), and a substrate of fatty acid and amino acid synthesis. The metabolic link between the glycolysis and the TCA cycle is represented by the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)&#x02013;pyruvate&#x02013;oxaloacetate node, which directs carbon flux and acts as a switch point for carbon flux distribution within the central metabolism [<xref rid="B5-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, poor coordination between glucose consumption and precursor synthesis in the TCA cycle has been seen as one of the responsible causes for the incomplete oxidation of glucose and production of alternative metabolites&#x02014;namely, overflow metabolites [<xref rid="B6-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the control of pyruvate homeostasis and its fate is of great importance for cell robustness and viability during environmental changes.</p><p>It is well known that in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, preferred carbon sources, such as glucose, are able to repress the transport and catabolism of alternative substrates. This carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is achieved through the transcriptional control of genes required for the utilization of secondary carbon sources, imposing a hierarchy in the use of the available nutrients and preventing the waste of resources. Different mechanisms exist in bacteria for the signal transduction pathways that lead to the CCR. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the CCR is mediated by the phosphotransferase system (PTS). PTS is a multiprotein phosphorelay mechanism that catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates and their simultaneous translocation across the cell membrane. The CCR is also mediated by the catabolite control protein A (CcpA), a pleiotropic transcription factor and a master regulatory protein, which can also function as a carbon catabolite activator (CCA) in certain genes, the histidine-containing protein HPr of the PTS, and the bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK) [<xref rid="B9-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>During sugar uptake, a chain reaction is triggered inside the cells, where, after successive phosphorylation, a phosphoryl group is transferred to the His15 residue of the HPr. Ultimately, the HPr-His-P transfers the phosphoryl group to the enzymatic transporter EII, allowing the uptake of glucose. Furthermore, it is known that when the intracellular concentration of fructose bisphosphate (FbP) is high, HPr can also be phosphorylated at Ser46 by the HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK). This reaction allows the binding of HPr-Ser-P to CcpA. The HPr&#x02013;Ser&#x02013;P&#x02013;CcpA interaction permits the binding of CcpA to specific sites on the DNA and, thereby, represses or activates the transcription of determined genes [<xref rid="B10-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Although extensive studies have been carried out concerning the CCR phenomenon, the characterization of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cultivated in pyruvate and carbon source co-utilization studies using pyruvate are still scarce.</p><p>Recently, a pyruvate transport system was identified and characterized in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="B8-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B14-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Charbonnier and co-workers verified that the preferred carbon sources in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, glucose or malate, trigger the binding of CcpA upstream of the <italic>pftAB</italic> gene, which encodes a pyruvate facilitated transporter, resulting in the repression of pyruvate utilization. When these preferred carbon sources are absent, CcpA repression is diminished [<xref rid="B8-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, a two-component regulatory system named LytST is also involved in pyruvate metabolism and uptake through the membrane. LytST induces the expression of <italic>pftAB</italic> in the presence of external pyruvate. However, when the pyruvate flux into the cells is high, <italic>pftAB</italic> transcription is retro-inhibited via LytST. It was also shown that LytST activity works in a pyruvate dose manner, which permits the balance of intracellular pyruvate levels and adaptation to environmental changes [<xref rid="B8-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The ability to use diverse carbon sources represents a key adaptation mechanism that allows cells to thrive in their natural habitat. Building on this knowledge, we became interested in how pyruvate is metabolized. Specifically, these observations raise the question of whether a co-assimilation of pyruvate and the preferred carbon source, glucose, from the medium would change in the presence of a high pyruvate gradient. So far, little is known concerning the absence of Pyk, how this affects the uptake and secretion patterns of pyruvate and other carbon sources in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Thus, we wanted to provide deeper insights into the physiology and metabolic responses of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> to the absence of pyruvate kinase (Pyk), and, ultimately, give hints towards the possible rerouting of carbon fluxes through alternative pathways. To do so, a combination of <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy as well as chromatographic separation coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS, HPLC-MS, and LC-MS/MS) was applied, allowing the identification of the extra and intracellular metabolites of wild type (wt) and &#x00394;pyk cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-metabolites-09-00216"><title>2.

Several metabolites showed altered concentration levels when both strains were compared. The major differences were the notably increased levels of glycolytic metabolites in &#x00394;pyk, such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), with a fold change (FC) of 10, followed by glucose 6-phosphate (FC 5.0), fructose 6-phosphate (FC 4.6), 3-phosphoglycerate (FC 3.1), and 2-phosphoglycerate (FC 3.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00216-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Considering the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), sedoheptulose 7-phosphate presented significant (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05) altered concentration levels (FC 3.2).

Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-metabolites-09-00216"><title>3.1. Carbon Catabolite Repression of Pyruvate Uptake in &#x00394;Pyk Cells Was Relieved</title><p>The present study comprehensively monitored changes in the intra and extracellular metabolites of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> but also the alterations in the metabolite uptake and secretion triggered by the absence of Pyk. An interesting outcome of this study is that pyruvate utilization was subject to glucose-dependent CCR in wt cells, while this repression was not observed in &#x00394;pyk. The rise in pyruvate influx in wt cells initiated at 360 min of growth, only after external glucose was depleted, indicating that pyruvate was susceptible to glucose-dependent CCR. This phenomenon is also perceived by the diauxic growth curve obtained, not described so far. On the other hand, in &#x00394;pyk, 6.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 mM of glucose was still available in the medium when pyruvate consumption was rapidly initiated. The CCR derepression seen in &#x00394;pyk can be hypothesized as a cellular metabolic response for the immediate need of other carbon sources, since the central metabolic pathway is possibly altered due to the accumulation of glycolytic metabolites (discussed below).</p><p>A pyruvate transport mechanism regulated by the master regulator CcpA was recently discovered. The CcpA controls the expression of <italic>pftAB</italic> that encodes a pyruvate facilitated transporter in accordance with the absence/presence of glucose or malate. With the knockout and overexpression of <italic>pftAB</italic>, it was concluded that the pyruvate gradient observed between the outside and the inside of the cell drives the facilitated PftAB-mediated transport of pyruvate across the cell membrane [<xref rid="B8-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In our study, when &#x00394;pyk cells are growing in M9GlcPyr and the intracellular pyruvate pool is presumably low, LytST might respond by inducing <italic>pftAB</italic> transcription sense due to the high pyruvate gradient concentration, leading to a rapid increase in pyruvate influx. In wt, where the pyruvate concentration is under physiological levels inside the cells and the pyruvate gradient is lower, LytST induction is probably impaired and/or the repression of <italic>pftAB</italic> by CcpA is highly active. When glucose is completely consumed, the CCR effect on <italic>pftAB</italic> is relieved and wt cells are able to take up pyruvate as a nutrient source.</p><p>Preliminary studies were also conducted under cultivation with glucose as the single carbon source (data not shown). In these, the deletion of <italic>pyk</italic> resulted in the impairment of cell growth, a slow consumption of glucose from medium, and an accumulation of intracellular FbP (FC 5.3), when compared to the wt. It is speculated that a possible cause for the low glucose consumption rate seen in &#x00394;pyk is the impairment of glucose uptake by the PTS system due to the accumulation of high levels of FbP. The concentration of FbP has been proposed to regulate the PTS system at the level of EII-mediated uptake. A high concentration of FbP directly stimulates the phosphorylation of HPr through HPrK, favoring the formation of the HPr&#x02013;Ser&#x02013;P&#x02013;CcpA complex [<xref rid="B16-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Further experiments are necessary to clarify the glucose dynamics in &#x00394;pyk and the possibility of the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system being impaired. These should include the inspection of other PTS sugar transport by &#x00394;pyk, the quantization of HPr-Ser-P, and the HPrK activity levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-metabolites-09-00216"><title>3.2. The TCA cycle and the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) Are Possibly Altered in &#x00394;pyk</title><p>In the initial exponential growth of wt cells with available glucose and pyruvate, no TCA cycle metabolites were detected outside the cells, which is predicted to be weakly active during this growth phase [<xref rid="B18-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, when preferred carbon sources are available in the medium, the activity of the first TCA cycle enzymes is inhibited by several regulatory proteins [<xref rid="B10-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B19-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When the external glucose was depleted, an efflux of 2-oxoglutarate in wt was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-09-00216-f002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting an increase in TCA cycle activity in response to cell requirements. At this time point (360 min), pyruvate consumption also begun, which can be used for replenishment of the TCA cycle.</p><p>As previously discussed, during the late exponential growth phase of &#x00394;pyk, pyruvate uptake is initiated when glucose is still available. Notably, at this time, 2-oxoglutarate secretion begins, reaching 30% of the concentration seen in wt (0.23 &#x000b1; 0.03 mM and 0.07 &#x000b1; 0.01mM for wt and &#x00394;pyk, respectively) at the end of cultivation. Nevertheless, in stationary phase, TCA cycle repression was possibly relieved for the use of alternative carbon sources in the central metabolic pathways. Thus, pyruvate that is crossing into the cell is oxidized to acetyl-CoA production or catabolized by pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate, and immediately directed to the TCA cycle.</p><p>As previously described, the growth of &#x00394;pyk resulted in accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate. It has been reported that the lack of Pyk in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> under glucose medium increases the flux of glucose 6-phosphate through the PPP [<xref rid="B20-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although just a few metabolites of this pathway were identified by our method, the results are consistent with this finding, since sedoheptulose 7-phosphate showed higher amounts in &#x00394;pyk. The perturbation seen in glycolysis in the mutant could have caused the reroute of flux metabolism to compensate the required amount of NAD(P)H and synthesis of nucleotide precursors [<xref rid="B24-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-metabolites-09-00216"><title>3.3. Overflow Metabolites: Increased Secretion of Acetoin and 2,3-Butanediol by &#x00394;pyk</title><p>Common phenomena during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cultivation with high availability of carbon sources are the production and secretion of overflow metabolites, even in aerobic conditions. Studies suggest that the onset of overflow metabolism during a surplus of carbon and energy is driven by the saturation of the electron transport chain that generates the demanding ATP in fast-growing cells, and the imbalance of the intracellular NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio observed prior to the beginning of fermentation [<xref rid="B26-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>As typical in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, acetate was the overflow compound with the highest secretion amount [<xref rid="B24-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The expression of the genes involved in the synthesis of acetate is activated by CcpA in the presence of glucose (CCA effect). Moreover, the gene involved in the utilization of acetate is subject to CCR [<xref rid="B10-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B28-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consistently, acetate was secreted as soon as glucose was imported and metabolized by both strains. When the stationary phase was reached, acetate uptake was not noticed, as commonly reported [<xref rid="B11-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B30-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although acetate could be reimported and utilized as an alternative carbon source after the depletion of glucose (and the consequent diminish of the CCR effect), cells preferred to utilize pyruvate. Thus, acetate efflux continued until the end of cultivation. Yet, it is speculated that acetate influx could be observed if cells were cultivated for longer. Furthermore, it is also hypothesized, that acetate uptake could have been subject of catabolic repression by pyruvate since the latter was consumed as an alternative carbon source during the exponential phase.</p><p>Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol secretions were also detected. Notably, the effluxes were much higher in &#x00394;pyk than in wt. The reason for these differences remains unclear. The upper high efflux of acetoin was previously observed [<xref rid="B31-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The production of these overflow metabolites is perceived as a preventive mechanism of environment acidification due to acetate accumulation [<xref rid="B29-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B32-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Acetoin is synthesized from pyruvate and can either be secreted or converted into 2,3-butanediol in order to generate NAD<sup>+</sup>. These compounds can also be reimported during the stationary phase and, in this way, are used as an energy-storing strategy. The fact that &#x00394;pyk secreted more acetoin and 2,3-butanediol than in wt leads us to think that the perturbation occurring in the pyruvate node could result in the imbalance of the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, which is known to be potentially toxic to the cells [<xref rid="B26-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B33-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Consistently, the higher synthesis of acetoin and subsequent 2,3-butanediol results in more NAD<sup>+</sup> molecules being regenerated, which can help balance the reducing power ratio. Likewise, the secretion of acetoin and, to an extent, 2,3-butanediol occurred alongside acetate accumulation, which is in agreement with the fact that acetoin synthesis can also be induced by acetate [<xref rid="B32-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B34-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-metabolites-09-00216" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>This study shows the metabolic responses of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> lacking Pyk. We were able to highlight relevant metabolic differences between wt and &#x00394;pyk cells when monitored in a chemically defined medium with glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources.</p><p>In this work, a new quality of information regarding the metabolism and adaptation to the absence of key signal mechanisms in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was provided. Investigations of cells lacking Pyk uncovered alterations in the import of glucose and pyruvate from the nutritional media. The concomitant consumption of both metabolites in &#x00394;pyk cells was observed, whereas in wt, the uptake of pyruvate was perceived after the complete consumption of glucose. This distinct behavior is in accordance with the pyruvate transport mechanism recently discovered in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. While in wt, the pyruvate utilization suffers CCR by the CcpA-dependent glucose repressor, in &#x00394;pyk, this effect is possibly relieved due to the induction of the pyruvate facilitated transporter genes, by LytST. The lack of Pyk and consequent low intracellular pyruvate level could be involved in this induction, since LytST works in a pyruvate dose- and gradient-manner. Although the metabolic results provided help to elucidate the regulatory transport of glucose and pyruvate, complete knowledge of the pyruvate transport mechanism and the adaptation to new gradient concentrations by <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is yet to be determined. Other prominent pathways were affected by the <italic>pyk</italic> mutation such as the overflow metabolism, TCA cycle, and the PPP.
