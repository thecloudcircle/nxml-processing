Knowing as a novel sensing/sampling paradigm, the theory of CS asserts certain signals that are considered sparse or compressible can be possibly reconstructed from substantially fewer measurements than those required by traditional methods. Our study aims to employ a novel reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization CS method for deriving the spectrum of the modulating signal of IPFM model from incomplete RR measurements for HRV assessments. To evaluate the performance of HRV spectral estimation, a quantitative measure, referred to as the Percent Error Power (PEP) that measures the percentage of difference between the true spectrum and the spectrum derived from the incomplete RR dataset, was used. We studied the performance of spectral reconstruction from incomplete simulated and real HRV signals by experimentally truncating a number of RR data accordingly in the top portion, in the bottom portion, and in a random order from the original RR column vector. As a result, for up to 20% data truncation/loss the proposed reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization CS method produced, on average, 2.34%, 2.27%, and 4.55% PEP in the top, bottom, and random data-truncation cases, respectively, on Autoregressive (AR) model derived simulated HRV signals. Similarly, for up to 20% data loss the proposed method produced 5.15%, 4.33%, and 0.39% PEP in the top, bottom, and random data-truncation cases, respectively, on a real HRV database drawn from PhysioNet. Moreover, results generated by a number of intensive numerical experiments all indicated that the reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization CS method always achieved the most accurate and high-fidelity HRV spectral estimates in every aspect, compared with the <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization based method and Lomb's method used for estimating the spectrum of HRV from unevenly sampled RR data.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC) under the Grant NSC 102-2221-E-182-023.

For example, inspecting the beat-to-beat interval, or the so-called RR interval, time series that are directly derived from the Electrocardiogram (ECG), one may notice there exists a certain degree of variation in the RR data sequence. Such intriguing interbeat variations in Heart Rate (HR) actually result from the ANS control. Therefore, one may speculate that the investigations into the modulation of ANS activity may be sought via the analysis of this interbeat variability, or alternatively referred to as the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) <xref rid="pone.0099098-Akselrod1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099098-Pagani1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In fact, the analysis results of HRV can be applied for evaluating the condition of the patient's heart in many aspects of clinical applications. Among all these applications, the beat-to-beat variations are generally quantified simply by processing the interbeat interval sequence on time and/or frequency domain. In frequency-domain analysis, for example, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of HR or RR signal is usually divided into two main frequency components: the Lower Frequency (LF) band ranging from 0.04 Hz to 0.15 Hz, and the Higher Frequency (HF) one ranging from 0.15 Hz to 0.4 Hz. While the HF power is used to serve as an HRV index that reflects the vagal tone, the LF power is considered to reflect the modulation of both the sympathetic and vagal activities <xref rid="pone.0099098-Akselrod1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099098-Pagani1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The LF-to-HF power ratio is thus used to reflect the autonomic or sympatho-vagal balance status <xref rid="pone.0099098-Malliani1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099098-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to direct beat-to-beat interval analysis, one may also obtain the information related to ANS control that is not directly measurable simply using a model-based analysis. In this aspect, the Integral Pulse Frequency Modulation (IPFM) model has been used to generate the discrete beat occurrence times from a continuous-time modulating signal that represents the ANS influences on sinoatrial (SA) node <xref rid="pone.0099098-Laguna1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099098-deBoer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In fact, the IPFM model has been widely discussed and applied for the generation and analysis of HRV spectra in a number of previous researches in literature <xref rid="pone.0099098-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099098-Solem1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Among these works, Mitov, Chen and Zhang proposed two IPFM-based methods for HRV spectral analysis, respectively, that both employed unevenly sampled raw RR data as the input <xref rid="pone.0099098-Mitov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099098-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, both works did not discuss about how to deal with the cases of data deficiency on RR intervals caused by ectopic beats. In addition, Mateo and Laguna defined a novel heart timing signal based on the IPFM model and estimated HRV spectra via various types of Fourier transform of interpolated heart timing signal <xref rid="pone.0099098-Mateo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0099098-Solem1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> further developed two robust HRV spectral estimation algorithms, respectively, that can detect and recover ectopic beats in heart timing signal.</p><p>On the other hand, knowing as a novel sensing/sampling paradigm, the theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) asserts certain signals that are considered sparse or compressible can be possibly reconstructed from substantially fewer measurements than those required by traditional methods <xref rid="pone.0099098-Baraniuk1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099098-Cands1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Continued research investigations have addressed important issues across many applications spanning from data compression <xref rid="pone.0099098-Baron1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, channel coding <xref rid="pone.0099098-Cands2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, data acquisition <xref rid="pone.0099098-Takhar1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, to biomedical signal and image processing. In biomedical signal/image processing, although CS has been successfully applied to a variety of topics, such as Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction <xref rid="pone.0099098-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) <xref rid="pone.0099098-Lustig1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, there still remains a lack in its applications into HRV or the related analysis.</p><p>In fact, we may hypothesize that a spectrum of HRV can be described as a sparse or compressible signal since it is widely accepted that major characteristics of a standard HRV spectrum are determined by the amplitudes of three main frequency components only (two are located at the frequency &#x0003c;0.15 Hz; while one is at that &#x0003e;0.15 Hz), and the remainders can be ignored. Therefore, we may take the advantage of using the CS framework to solve for the problem of HRV spectral estimation from substantially fewer measurements. In this aspect, we have combined the use of <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization based CS framework and the collaboration of IPFM model for deriving the amplitude spectrum of the modulating signal for HRV assessments in a previous work <xref rid="pone.0099098-Chen4" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The primary purpose of our previous work is to establish a CS-based theoretical procedure that can be used to quantitatively characterize the spectrum of HRV using the unevenly sampled RR data. As a result, it was indicated by our previous study that the CS analysis was capable of robustly capturing the spectral information of the fluctuations associated with RR time series of normal heartbeats, even under the situation of a degree of incompleteness in the RR data caused by ectopic or missing beats. It is also worth noting that such a CS-based spectral estimation was unprecedented in HRV analysis.</p><p>This study aims at seeking for an enhancement of performance in spectral estimation of HRV by employing a reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization based CS method for compressible spectrum recovery that may outperform <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization in actual practice. First, it should be noted that for most CS algorithms, their successful reconstruction is based on some probability. That is, one cannot ensure each run of algorithms can necessarily get correct reconstruction. However, one can get the correct reconstruction with large probability if some assumptions are satisfied. In contrast, the probability will be smaller when there is noise, or when the sensing matrix is coherent, or when the number of nonzero entries in the true signal is large, i.e., the signal is not sparse enough&#x02026;etc. In particular, it is known that the global minimum of the <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization algorithm is not necessary the true optimal solution if the ideal assumptions stated above are not all satisfied. In this aspect, Cand&#x000e8;s <italic>et al</italic>. proposed an empirical method which tries to solve this problem by employing reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization <xref rid="pone.0099098-Cands3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Since obtaining the true optimal solution in a more practical situation is desired and crucial in our work, seeking for more appropriate choice of algorithm thus motivates this study. Therefore, in this study we further hypothesized that the reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization based CS method may be more suitable for spectral estimation of HRV in more practical situations, such as the presence of noise, the coherent sensing matrix, and/or not very sparse HRV spectrum. The objective of this study is to achieve a substantial improvement and enhancement of performance in spectral estimation of HRV using such a novel method. This paper presents a reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization based CS algorithm incorporating the IPFM model for spectral estimation of HRV. In fact, the novel method involves solving a sequence of weighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization problems where the weights used for the next iteration are simply computed from the value of the current solution. Numerical experimental results produced by both Autoregressive (AR) model derived simulated signals and a real HRV database of PhysioNet demonstrated that the proposed method can robustly generate the most accurate and high-fidelity HRV spectral estimates, in comparison to our previous <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization based CS work and Lomb's method used for estimating spectrum of HRV from unevenly sampled RR data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.1.

In order to achieve statistical significance, we here employed a set of real RR data from the interbeat (RR) interval databases of PhysioNet <xref rid="pone.0099098-Goldberger1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> for comprehensive examinations. In general, PhysioNet collects a large number of physiological signals and programs used to manipulate the signals. Almost all of the resources are free of charge. The testing database we adopted here is called the Normal Sinus Rhythm RR Interval (NSR-RRI) Database, comprising 54 datasets of RR intervals in total. In fact, the NSR-RRI database includes beat annotation files derived from 54 long-term ECG recordings of subjects in normal sinus rhythm (thirty men, aged 28.5 to 76, and twenty-four women, aged 58 to 73). The original ECG recordings (not available) were sampled and digitized at 128 samples per second, and the beat annotations were obtained by automated analysis with manual review and correction <xref rid="pone.0099098-NSRRRI1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we took a 1000-point RR segment from each of the 54 RR datasets for our numerical experimental analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099098-g006">Fig. 6</xref> shows a 1000-point RR segment drawn from an NSR-RRI dataset (NSR054) and its corresponding normalized PSD derived from the reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization CS method.

We may speculate that this should be due to the non-stationary nature of the real RR signals and thus, losing up to 10&#x02013;20% of data in the top or bottom portion of the RR vector would severely alter the characteristics of HRV spectrum. In contrast, the performance obtained from the randomly truncated RR dataset appeared to be degraded much more quickly when <italic>R</italic> became large, say <italic>R</italic>&#x0003e;0.7, indicating that in the randomly-truncated case an incomplete RR dataset with over 70% loss in RR data would not be able to preserve the major HRV spectral characteristics anymore.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>For online or mobile applications, it has been generally accepted that 5-minute ECG measurement is adequate for short-term HRV analysis <xref rid="pone.0099098-Akselrod1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099098-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This choice of analysis time frame was actually imposed by the need to meet a good compromise between a sufficient frequency resolution and the signal stationarity which is required for reliable spectral estimation. However, such a choice may still be inadequately long. According to our numerical experimental results obtained from the performance evaluation, one may see the proposed reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization based CS method can still well recover most of the spectral estimates of HRV from a highly incomplete RR dataset formed by truncating a significant portion from the bottom of the original RR data vector. For example, inspecting the numerical results in terms of averaged percent error LF/HF ratio obtained by applying the proposed method to the bottom-truncated case as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099098-t003">Table 3</xref>, we may see even up to 20% data loss would only result in about 3.04% averaged percent error in LF-to-HF power ratio estimate. Similarly, it is also indicated from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099098-t004">Table 4</xref> that for up to 20% data loss, the averaged percent error VLF/HF ratio was about only 5.13% in the bottom-truncated case for the proposed method. This actually implies for online short-term HRV analysis, while the conventional 5-minute measurement interval may be reduced up to 4 minutes so the short-time spectrum of HRV can be updated more quickly than before, about 95% of the spectral LF/HF or VLF/HF power ratio estimate would still remain unchanged with the same frequency resolution.</p><p>On the other hand, the missing or ectopic beats would cause abnormal beat-to-beat intervals, alternatively known as the outliers, which occur randomly and are longer or shorter than normal RR intervals. This actually represents a major source of error when analyzing HRV data in both the time and frequency domain. In particular, spectral estimation of HRV would be adversely affected by the presence of missing or ectopic beats, even only a small number of such beats. In fact, the potential impact of the proposed reweighted <italic>&#x02113;<sub>1</sub></italic>-minimization algorithm is it can be robustly applied for either online or offline high-fidelity HRV spectral estimation, even under the situation of a certain degree of incompleteness in the RR data caused by ectopic or missing beats generated randomly. This has actually been implied by our numerical experimental results presented earlier in this paper. First, it is indicated from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099098-t003">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099098-t004">4</xref> that up to 10% data loss in the randomly-truncated case would result in only about 8.18% and 5.34% averaged percent errors in LF-to-HF and VLF-to-HF power ratio estimates, respectively, suggesting that both the spectral LF/HF and VLF/HF power ratio estimates would still robustly remain at good estimation accuracy with the same frequency resolution. Note that such a performance is actually way better than good enough in actual practice since the typical outlier occupancy in an HRV signal should be within 5% in most cases. In addition, most of the existing QRS complex detectors may achieve even less than 1% false positives and false negatives (or above 99% detection accuracy) for the task of QRS detection <xref rid="pone.0099098-Chen5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>About the limitations of the study, it should be noted first that in dealing with the situation involving the presence of outliers it is essential that an automatic detection of outliers in RR intervals be demanded before applying the proposed method to spectral analysis of HRV. In fact, the proposed method can be in conjunction with an existing RR outlier removal algorithm to estimate HRV spectra directly from RR intervals under the presence of outliers caused by ectopic beats. Although there are a number of RR outlier detection algorithms available <xref rid="pone.0099098-Moody1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, we are also developing such an algorithm that may facilitate the use of the proposed method in near future. Such an automatic detection mechanism may be also considered as a connection between the proposed method and its use for HRV assessment. In addition, it is also worth noting that the execution time of our method under MATLAB is generally within 1-2 seconds with 1000 data points. The processor type we used in generating all the results here was the X86 Family 6 Model 23 Stepping 10 GenuineIntel 3333 MHz CPU. Although it is suitable for online HRV analysis, it is still a little time consuming. In this aspect, since recent developments in Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) have shown its great potentials in accessing to high performance computing applications due to its massive multithreading capability, a GPU-based approach with the applications into the CS-IPFM based spectral analysis of HRV using a unified architecture, called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), can be further explored and evaluated in near future.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, a novel HRV spectral estimation method developed by combining the use of the IPFM model and the CS framework is proposed.
