Determining the intracellular trafficking and localization mechanisms of potassium channels provides a platform to fully characterize their maturation and functionality. Previous investigations have discovered residues or motifs that exist in their primary structure, which directly promote anterograde trafficking of nascent potassium channels. Recently, a non-conical di-acidic motif (E483/484) has been discovered in the C-terminus of the mammalian homologue of the <italic>Shaker</italic> voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily member 3 (Kv1.3), and was shown to disrupt the anterograde trafficking of Kv1.3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have further investigated the intracellular trafficking requirements of Kv1.3 both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Approximately one-third of all eukaryotic proteins undergo transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the ER-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC). This pathway is termed the anterograde early secretory pathway and is facilitated by the coat protein complex II (COPII) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The COPII secretory machinery is composed of five cytosolic proteins; Sar1, Sec23, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31, which assemble in a processive and stepwise fashion (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). Many protein types travel through this pathway including a large class of integral membrane proteins known as the voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv channels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Kv channels are molecular machines that are selective for and conduct potassium ions across cellular membranes in response to changes in membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There are forty human Kv channel family members that account for more than half of the seventy-eight potassium channel proteins identified in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The spatial and temporal distribution of Kv channels is a critical determinant of cell excitability and therefore these proteins remain a concentrated target of pharmacological drug studies to alleviate neuroinflammatory and autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, recent investigations have identified their peripheral roles in the regulation of metabolism, body weight, and management of type II diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although, it has been found that Kv channels contain numerous signaling domains, which are primarily located on the cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, the mechanism(s) by which Kv channels reach their functional locations have not been completely characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has been shown that the N-terminus contains the T1 tetramerization domain, which promotes the formation of properly assembled channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], while the C-terminus is recognized to harbor the ER export motif that facilitates efficient processing and localization of Kv channels to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Several sequences have been shown to be associated with ER export of potassium channels. In the Kv1 family, a highly conserved C-terminal motif, HRETE has been shown to contribute to channel trafficking of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, red box). A different motif, VxxSL, where x represents any amino acid followed by Ser then Leu, was discovered in Kv1.4 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, black box). This sequence was reported to have a significant role in that protein&#x02019;s intracellular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In Kv1.3, a non-canonical di-acidic ER export motif was discovered at positions E483-E484 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, blue box). This motif is located further downstream from the previously reported HRETE motif (residues 441-445 of mouse Kv1.3) and was suggested to associate with Sec24d to promote the anterograde trafficking of Kv1.3 channels within the secretory pathway. Di-acidic exit motifs found in the C-termini of other potassium channels include VLSEVDETD in the inward rectifier (Kir) Kir1 subfamily, FCYENE in Kir2.1, ELETEEEE and NQDMEIGV in the Kir3.2A and Kir3.4 family members respectively, and EDE in the two-pore potassium channel (K<sub>2p</sub>) TASK-3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, these potassium channel families share little sequence homology in their C-termini, yet their ER export mechanism(s) show a dependence on a di-acidic motif for efficient passage through the anterograde early secretory pathway.</p><p>The COPII cargo adaptor subunit Sec24 has four human isoforms (Sec24a-d) where different isoforms are recognized to bind to or associate with unique anterograde trafficking motifs to mediate ER export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Sec24 isoforms a and b have been shown to associate primarily with a di-acidic motif, D/ExD/E, where D/E are acidic residues, while Sec24 c and d recognize a series of hydrophobic residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Many of the ER exit motifs in potassium channel families contain di-acidic motifs, and mutations in these regions have been shown to disrupt potassium channel cell surface localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A putative canonical di-acidic motif is present on the cytoplasmic C-terminus of mouse Kv1.3 between residues 443-447 (ETEGE) that is partially contained in and extends beyond the HRETE sequence previously shown to contribute to the trafficking of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Here, we show that this stretch of acidic residues has a modest yet measureable effect on the anterograde trafficking of Kv1.3 channels. Furthermore, we show a disruption of Kv1.3 anterograde trafficking upon knockdown of Sec24a and demonstrate that Kv1.3 is a bona fide client of this cargo adaptor isoform using an <italic>in vitro</italic> membrane flotation assay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fluorescent tag of Kv1.3 channel does not perturb biophysical properties</title><p>Although it has been previously examined in other expression systems, we confirmed that our N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) insertion did not alter Kv1.3 channel function. Kv1.3-eGFP biophysics were compared to wild type (wt) Kv1.3 using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Kv1.3-eGFP exhibited nearly identical biophysical characteristics as that of wtKv1.3. Addition of the N-terminal eGFP did not significantly alter the magnitude of the peak or sustained current, the current-voltage relationship, the voltage at half activation (V<sub>1/2</sub>), or the kinetics of inactivation or deactivation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that there are no deleterious alterations of the Kv1.3 channel properties when fused with the eGFP reporter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Identifying the role of the Kv1.3 C-terminus in the anterograde early secretory pathway</title><p>We first set out to determine the role of the Kv1.3-eGFP C-terminus in its anterograde early secretory trafficking mechanism. Upon deletion of the C-terminus (Kv1.3-eGFP &#x00394;C), HEK 293 cells expressing the Kv1.3-eGFP &#x00394;C channel showed a dramatic reduction in the outward current as compared to Kv1.3-eGFP as studied by patch-clamp electrophysiology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). To better understand the consequences of deleting the C-terminus of Kv1.3-eGFP, we visualized the trafficking defect using confocal microscopy in BSC40 cells. Kv1.3-eGFP &#x00394;C was highly retained in the ER tubular network as seen by its co-localization with&#x000a0;the membranous ER resident protein Sec61&#x003b2; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>; white arrows). Thus, the C-terminus of Kv1.3 was a major determinant in promoting the ER export of Kv1.3 channels.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Biophysical properties of Kv1.3 channels following mutations of the acidic ER export motif. <bold>a</bold> Bar graph of the mean peak (left) or sustained (middle) current (&#x000b1; s.e.m.) for various voltage-clamped Kv1.3-eGFP or mutant channels as recorded in cell-attached patches using a single step depolarization of +40&#x000a0;mV (V<sub>c</sub>) from a holding potential (V<sub>h</sub>) of -80&#x000a0;mV.

Moreover, the HRETE motif had previously been shown in Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 to contribute to trafficking of those proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To examine the influence of the ExExE acidic motif in Kv1.3, we screened these acidic residues for their involvement to promote surface localization by patch-clamp electrophysiology after mutation using site-directed mutagenesis. The assumption was made that the degree of surface localization or channel density was proportional to current magnitude. There were no significant changes in the mean peak or sustained current magnitude of Kv1.3-eGFP E443A, or the Kv1.3-eGFP E443A-E445A-E447A mutants. The kinetics of inactivation for the E443A and E443A-E445A-E447A mutant channels demonstrated a strong trend to decrease the inactivation rate but did not reach statistical significance. The rate constant for the deactivation of the E443A and E443A-E445A-E447A channels was significantly less than that of the Kv1.3-eGFP channel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Finally, there was a significant increase in the voltage dependence for both the E443A and E443A-E445A-E447A mutant channels. The voltage at half-activation shifted to the left (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) 6 and 13&#x000a0;mV, respectively, representing a substantial change in movement of the channel at a more hyperpolarized state. While these changes in kinetics and voltage sensitivity would not be predicted to be involved in Kv1.3 trafficking, they represent changes in channel function attributed to manipulation of the acidic C-terminal motif where the Kv1.3 channel is driven to a more excitable state by reaching the activation threshold at more hyperpolarized potentials. It was not possible to explore these secondary biophysical changes for the Kv1.3-eGFP &#x02206;C construct due to lack of resolvable current.</p><p>To further understand the ExExE acidic motif, we visualized the Kv1.3-eGFP localization using confocal microscopy. Single (Kv1.3-eGFP E443A and Kv1.3-eGFP E445A) and double point mutations (Kv1.3-eGFP E443A-E445A and Kv1.3-eGFP E445A-E447A) were found to be efficiently trafficked to the cell surface of BSC40 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a-c and e-f</xref>). Kv1.3-eGFP E447A and the triple point mutant Kv1.3-eGFP E443A-E445A-E447A, however, were moderately co-localized with the membranous ER resident protein Sec61&#x003b2; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d and g</xref>, respectively; white arrows). Line scans of each fluorescent channel further demonstrate the overlap of these two proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, right panel). These results demonstrate a moderate dependence on the acidic stretch of residues ExExE found within the C-terminus of Kv1.3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Kv1.3-eGFP ER retention on a population level</title><p>Although our patch-clamp results suggested that the surface density was unchanged between Kv1.3-eGFP or mutant proteins, that measurement doesn&#x02019;t account for the relative amounts of ER retention. To better understand the role of the acidic motif of Kv1.3 in ER trafficking, we compared the relative amounts of Kv1.3 in the ER over the total Kv1.3 expression for the different Kv1.3-eGFP mutants. The assays were conducted at 36&#x000a0;h post transfection across a population of HEK 293 cells as previous studies have shown high expression levels at that time point in that expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. ER retention of expressed Kv1.3-eGFP or mutant proteins was quantified by isolating ER microsomes from HEK 293 cells then using SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot densitometry analysis to determine the relative amounts of Kv1.3-eGFP protein retained in the ER microsomes. The ER microsome isolation was verified by probing for the luminal ER resident protein BiP, the luminal Golgi resident protein GCP60, the nuclear and perinuclear heat shock protein of 90&#x000a0;kDa (HSP90), and the cytosolic protein glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>A). The relative amount of carryover from the GCP60, HSP90, and GAPDH proteins is low compared to the amount of BiP present in the final pellet indicating that our microsomes are representative of the contents of the ER. ER microsome isolations from cells expressing the Kv1.3-eGFP proteins were also probed for BiP (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>B) indicating that the ER microsomes from the cells expressing Kv1.3-eGFP or the respective mutant proteins remain intact through the isolation procedure. Western blots probing for Kv1.3-eGFP protein (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>C) were further subjected to computer-assisted densitometry where the amount of total protein found in homogenized HEK 293 cells was compared to the amount of Kv1.3-eGFP protein retained within the ER microsome enriched fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The amount of Kv1.3-eGFP protein remaining in the ER was less (~30&#x000a0;%) when compared to both the Kv1.3-eGFP E445A and the Kv1.3-eGFP E443A-E445A-E447A mutant (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008). This demonstrated that more of the Kv1.3-eGFP protein was exported from the ER than the Kv1.3-eGFP E443A-E445A-E447A mutant protein. Pairwise statistical comparisons between Kv1.3-eGFP and all other mutants determined that only the triple point mutant Kv1.3-eGFP E443A-E445A-E447A had a statistically significant amount of protein retained in the ER. The retention assay could not be used to determine the amount of Kv1.3-eGFP &#x00394;C protein retained within the ER because the epitope used to generate the Kv1.3 channel antibody, FSU 120, was located on the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. These results indicate that the acidic motif found within the C-terminus of Kv1.3 was not entirely dispensable, but was also not an exclusive requirement for Kv1.3 trafficking within the early anterograde secretory pathway.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Retention of Kv1.3-eGFP in the ER upon sequential mutation of the acidic motif.

To better understand the Kv1.3-eGFP trafficking patterns upon Sec24 knockdown, we first co-transfected silenced COS-1 cells with cDNAs encoding Kv1.3-eGFP and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) tagged with a cerulean reporter (VSVG-Cerulean), the latter of which has been extensively characterized in the early secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

There were no dramatic changes in the intracellular trafficking profiles upon Sec24c, Sec24d, and Sec24cd knockdown (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The intracellular trafficking profile of the VSVG-cerulean protein exhibited similar features as the Kv1.3-eGFP trafficking profile as these proteins almost completely co-localized with each other in all experimental conditions. This observation is further demonstrated by their respective line scan profiles (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, right panel). To further explore the Kv1.3-eGFP trafficking disruption caused by knockdown of Sec24, silenced COS-1 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding Kv1.3-eGFP and the membranous ER resident protein Sec61&#x003b2;-mCherry cDNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Kv1.3-eGFP co-localized with Sec61&#x003b2; in the Sec24a, Sec24b, Sec24a-b, and Sec24a-d, but not in the Sec24c, Sec24d, or Sec24cd knock down conditions. The intracellular fluorescent trafficking profile for Kv1.3-eGFP was similar to that of the Kv1.3-eGFP &#x02206;C mutant upon double knockdown of Sec24a-b and also Sec24a-d (compare Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> with Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>) showing a strong retention of Kv1.3-eGFP within the endomembrane tubular network. Line scans of each fluorescent channel further demonstrate the overlap of these two proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, right panel). These results indicated that the early anterograde secretion of Kv1.3-eGFP protein from the ER relied upon the Sec24a and Sec24b isoforms.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Kv1.3-eGFP trafficking after siRNA mediated knockdown of Sec24.

Cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI. The wild-type (wt) trafficking profile is similar to the trafficking profile of Sec24c and Sec24cd knockdown conditions.

These analyses showed that solubilized and purified protein remained tetrameric. Interestingly, purified Kv1.3 proteins exchanged into the amphipol A8-35 appeared as a double band on 8&#x000a0;% SDS-PAGE. After addition of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP), the double band collapsed to a single band (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>C). These results agree with previous studies that showed how Kv1.3 could exist at multiple molecular weights depending on its state of phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Solubilized but non-dephosphorylated tetramers were then reconstituted into lipid bilayers, producing proteoliposomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Proteoliposomes are less dense than protein alone and floated to the top of a 25&#x000a0;% sucrose layer after centrifugation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c and d</xref>).

This is attributed to the fact that Kv1.3 in detergent micelles can reconstitute into membranes and therefore recruit Sec24a<sup>341</sup>.

Our data indicate that the canonical di-acidic motif under investigation is an alternative moderator of ER exiting, and likely functions together with the downstream signal E483-E484 found by Mart&#x000ed;nez-M&#x000e1;rmol <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to promote robust and efficient trafficking of Kv1.3 proteins. Adding to the complexity of Kv channel trafficking dynamics is the fact that Kv channels are known to form heteromeric assemblies. A heteromeric Kv1.3 channel containing one or more different alpha subunit(s) that possesses an intact ER export motif(s) would be able bypass the Kv1.3 trafficking defect and enter the anterograde secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, Kv channels have several interacting partners, such as the Kv beta subunit and the 14-3-3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], each of which are capable of rescuing a defect within the secretory pathway. These interactions likely all work together to facilitate robust and efficient Kv1.3 trafficking in the cell.</p><p>We have shown that deletion of the C-terminus of Kv1.3 produces a dramatic ER retention. This finding is in good agreement with other recent investigations that probed the trafficking defect produced after removal of the Kv1.3 C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our patch clamp analysis demonstrated that there is little to no current at the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells expressing the Kv1.3-eGFP &#x00394;C protein. We were not able to distinguish whether lack of current indicates that the Kv1.3-eGFP &#x00394;C protein was retained due to improper folding within the ER. Previous structural and biophysical characterization of Kv channels has found that the C-terminus of <italic>Shaker</italic> channels are intrinsically disordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. It is likely that deleting the disordered C-terminus of Kv1.3 would have a minimal effect, or none at all, on the tertiary and quaternary structure of Kv1.3. Taken together, we judge that removal of the Kv1.3 C-terminus probably impacts less upon protein folding and is more likely a functional loss of the ER export motif resulting in retention of the channel within the ER.</p><p>VSVG has been well documented to contain a di-acidic exit motif and to interact with the Sec24a and Sec24b isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. By using VSVG-cerulean as a trafficking control, we showed that the intracellular Kv1.3 trafficking profile is similar to that of VSVG in the presence and absence of siRNAs targeting individual Sec24 isoforms. When the Kv1.3-eGFP trafficking profile is observed together with VSVG-cerulean, there is a strong overlap between the two cargo proteins. When either or both Sec24a and Sec24b are knocked down, both Kv1.3 and VSVG are strongly retained. This demonstrates a strong dependence of Kv1.3 on Sec24a or Sec24b. Furthermore, we have shown that Sec24a<sup>341</sup> directly binds membrane reconstituted or detergent solubilized Kv1.3 proteins using a membrane floatation assay. This <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction supports the <italic>in vivo</italic> data that suggested Kv1.3 is a client of Sec24a.</p><p>We have investigated the requirement for Kv1.3 channels to exit the ER by an acidic motif dependent mechanism. Even though the atomic architectures of Kv channels are starting to be elucidated, ambiguities still exist in how these proteins are processed and eventually targeted to their functional domains. Li <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] were the first to propose the VxxSL ER exit motif for Kv1 channels. This motif, however, is not conserved in the Kv1.3 channel. Zhu <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] showed that trafficking of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 channels depend on a conserved C-terminal set of residues including an HRETE motif, which overlaps with the residues we tested in Kv1.3. Moreover, the HRETE motif was not completely targeted by Mart&#x000ed;nez-M&#x000e1;rmol <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], but a notable trafficking defect was observed when the E445A (in mouse Kv1.3, E442 in rat Kv1.3) residue was mutated. In that study, Mart&#x000ed;nez-M&#x000e1;rmol <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] showed that trafficking of Kv1.3 critically depends on the E483-E484 acidic residues, and demonstrated an <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction with Sec24d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Those authors make note that Sec24d co-localized with Kv1.3 only in the presence of elevated COPII coat protein Sar1b that functions to recruit the rest of the coat to the ER membrane. Furthermore, it has been well documented that Sec24d (and c) interacts with a stretch of hydrophobic residues while the Sec24a and b isoforms interact with a di-acidic motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It remains an open topic as to how the non-canonical di-acidic motif of Kv1.3 would associate with the Sec24d isoform. Mart&#x000ed;nez-M&#x000e1;rmol <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] used computational modeling to model the structure of the Kv1.3 C-terminus in association with Sec24a <italic>in lieu</italic> of Sec24d. They postulated that Kv1.3 contacts Sec24a in their modeled structure and by extension Sec24d <italic>in vivo</italic> by forming two salt bridges between E483-E484 of the homology modeled Kv1.3 C-terminus (there is no structural information currently available for the C-terminus of Kv1.3) and R750, R752, and Y437 of Sec24 (these residues are conserved across all Sec24 isoforms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>)). Though an explicit interaction between Kv1.3 and Sec24d cannot be ruled out, it remains unclear as to how the exclusive nature of this reported selectivity would be preserved if the E483-E484 residues could potentially bind any Sec24 isoform. Our Sec24 knockdown experiments, however, show that Kv1.3 exhibits a trafficking dependence on the Sec24a and Sec24b isoforms, which satisfies the current paradigm of how di-acidic motifs interact with the COPII cargo recruitment subunit isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the trafficking mechanism(s) by which Kv1.3 exits the ER and travels through the anterograde early secretory pathway was explored.

<bold>Basal biophysical properties of Kv1.3-eGFP channels.</bold> (A) Schematic showing that the eGFP reporter (green barrel) was inserted directly after the start codon of Kv1.3 on the N-terminus. The Kv1.3-eGFP &#x02206;C protein was truncated immediately after the S6 helix (dotted red line) at residue 427 of mouse Kv1.3. The three-glutamate residues of interest located at positions 443, 445, and 447 within the C-terminus of mouse Kv1.3 (red spheres) are indicated. (B) Representative current traces recorded from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding Kv1.3 alone (Kv1.3) or tagged with eGFP (Kv1.3-eGFP). Macroscopic currents were recorded from cell-attached patches held (V<sub>h</sub>) at -90mV and stepped in 10 mV increments to +40 mV (V<sub>c</sub>) using a 1000 millisecond pulse duration (P<sub>d</sub>) and a 60 s interpulse interval (T<sub>s</sub>). Mean current (&#x000b1; s.e.m.) is plotted for the family of generated voltage steps for five such recordings (right). Not significantly different by two-way ANOVA. (C) Same as in (B) but designed to resolve tail currents (5 mV increments; P<sub>d</sub> = 50 millisecond, T<sub>s</sub> = 10 s) that could be used to determine conductance and voltage-dependence (right).

<bold>ER microsome isolation assay for determining the amount of Kv1.3-eGFP or mutant protein retained.</bold> ER microsome isolation from HEK 293 cells. (A) Western blots probing for the ER luminal resident protein BiP, the Golgi luminal resident protein GCP60, the nuclear and perinuclear heat shock protein of 90 kDa (HSP90), and the cytosolic protein glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) during the microsome isolation centrifugation procedure. The homogenate, pre-clear supernatant (Preclear SN), and the pre-clear pellet contain BiP, GCP60, HSP90, and GAPDH. The ultracentrifugation supernatant (Ultra SN) is clear of BiP demonstrating that the ER microsomes remain intact through the centrifugation procedure. The Ultra SN contains GCP60 and GAPDH. The ultra pellet (Ultra P) has minor amounts of GCP60 and GAPDH but contains higher levels of BiP and HSP90, indicating that this fraction has been enriched for ER microsomes. (B) Western blots of the homogenate (top) and Ultra P (bottom) fractions from Kv1.3-eGFP and the respective mutants contain BiP, indicating that the ER microsomes from the cells expressing Kv1.3-eGFP or the respective mutant proteins remain intact through the isolation procedure.

<bold>Molecular weight characterization of recombinantly expressed Kv1.3 proteins.</bold> Molecular weight determination of purified Kv1.3 proteins. (A) Size exclusion chromatogram of Kv1.3 proteins from two different membrane mimetic environments, n-dodecylphosphocholine (Fos-12, solid line) or amphipols (A8-35, dashed line). The shift in the A8-35 elution peak is due to an increased molecular mass associated with absorption of the A8-35 molecules. Profiles were normalized to the injection point (volume = 0) and the absorbance units (mAU) were auto-zeroed. (B) Native gel electrophoresis of eluted Kv1.3 proteins in either Fos-12 or A8-35. Kv1.3 proteins in A8-35 (right lane) show an elongated band around the 242kDa standard indicating that Kv1.3 in A8-35 yields tetrameric complexes. (C) Coomassie stained 8&#x000a0;% SDS-PAGE of Kv1.3 in A8-35 before and after the addition of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (left and right middle lanes).
