To stimulate inflammation we utilized TNF&#x003b1;, a potent pro-inflammatory mediator that is elevated in the serum and vitreous of diabetic patients. In TNF&#x003b1;-stimulated primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells, total levels of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), but not epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs), were significantly decreased. Exogenous addition of 11,12-EET or 19,20-EDP when combined with 12-(3-adamantane-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA), an inhibitor of epoxide hydrolysis, inhibited VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression and protein levels; conversely the diol product of 19,20-EDP hydrolysis, 19,20-DHDP, induced <italic>VCAM1</italic> and <italic>ICAM1</italic> expression. 11,12-EET and 19,20-EDP also inhibited leukocyte adherence to human retinal microvascular endothelial cell monolayers and leukostasis in an acute mouse model of retinal inflammation. Our results indicate that this inhibition may be mediated through an indirect effect on NF&#x003ba;B activation. This is the first study demonstrating a direct comparison of EET and EDP on vascular inflammatory endpoints, and we have confirmed a comparable efficacy from each isomer, suggesting a similar mechanism of action. Taken together, these data establish that epoxygenated fatty acid elevation will inhibit early pathology related to TNF&#x003b1;-induced inflammation in retinal vascular diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>One third of the estimated 285 million diabetics world-wide show signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and one third of these have progressed to vision threatening DR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. DR presents in two clinically distinct forms commonly referred to as non-proliferative (NPDR) and proliferative (PDR) diabetic retinopathy, corresponding to the early and late stages of DR progression, respectively. NPDR is characterized by fundus abnormalities including microaneurysms, hemorrhages and vasoregression whereas PDR is defined by the presence of preretinal neovascularization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Inflammatory cytokines are elevated early in DR pathogenesis and presumably contribute to advancement of DR to later disease stages. Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, and its elevated serum and vitreous levels in DR patients correlate with disease progression and morbidity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Furthermore, deletion of TNF&#x003b1; inhibited diabetes-induced leukostasis and retinal vascular leakage in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. TNF&#x003b1; induces the expression of the leukocyte adhesion proteins vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (<italic>VCAM1</italic>) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (<italic>ICAM1</italic>) in human retinal endothelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Both function in the firm adherence of leukocytes facilitating their immobilization; a process referred to as leukostasis. When leukocytes adhere to the luminal surface of the retinal capillary endothelium, they are believed to cause the formation of vaso-occlusive thrombi that can obstruct blood flow, causing oxygen starvation and subsequent capillary death. The death of retinal capillaries is a pivotal point in DR pathogenesis because it results in the formation of focal areas of retinal ischemic that become hypoxic. In response to hypoxia, the retina elaborates vascular endothelial cell grow factor (VEGF) and other growth factors that promote the onset of PDR along with its associated vision-threatening morbidities. Adherent leukocytes also secrete noxious stimuli, such as reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines, which further contribute to inflammation, blood-retina barrier breakdown, retinal vasoregression, and edema; all hallmarks of DR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

Tissues can metabolize fatty acids to biologically active lipid mediators through the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) or cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP) pathways. While COX, LOX, and their products have received considerable attention in the diabetic retina<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, relatively little is known about the role of retinal CYP-derived lipid mediators. CYP enzymes are endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound monooxygenases that oxidize a variety of substrates, including polyunsaturated fatty acids. Two of these, arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in relatively high abundance in the retinal vasculature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, thus their metabolites may be of particular importance to retinal vascular homeostasis. A subset of CYP enzymes, including the well-characterized CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2J2 in humans, epoxygenate AA and DHA to produce epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) and epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDP), respectively. CYP enzymatic activity yields four EET (5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET) and five EDP (7,8-EDP, 10,11-EDP, 13,14-EDP, 16,17-EDP, 19,20-EDP) regioisomers. These epoxides, and particularly the EET products, are known to exert a number of potent anti-inflammatory activities in diverse vasculature beds, including reduced <italic>VCAM1</italic> and <italic>ICAM1</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) hydrolyzes EET and EDP to less biologically active diols (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) and dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DHDP), respectively)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, thereby reducing EET and EDP tissue levels and consequently, reducing their anti-inflammatory effects. Accordingly, sEH represents a rational and promising therapeutic target.

Notably, sEH inhibition has not yet been examined as a treatment for retinal disease.</p><p>Reduced levels of EET are observed in the vitreous of patients with NPDR and PDR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and the decreased epoxide levels may be permissive for increased retinal inflammation. Accordingly, therapeutic interventions that raise EET and EDP levels may be expected to ameliorate DR inflammation; however, these approaches have not been assessed. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that treatment of primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) with a DR-relevant inflammatory cytokine, TNF&#x003b1;, would decrease epoxide production, limiting their anti-inflammatory effects. Conversely, elevation of epoxide levels by their exogenous addition as well as sEH inhibition may block cytokine-induced inflammatory events in HRMEC, providing a basis for a viable therapeutic strategy to inhibit the retinal vascular inflammation that is observed at the onset of diabetic retinopathy.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>TNF&#x003b1; Decreases Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid Levels in HRMEC-Conditioned Medium</title><p>TNF&#x003b1; has previously been shown to alter levels of the cytochrome P450 enzymes that produce epoxygenated fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, however any effects of TNF&#x003b1; on EET or EDP production by endothelial cells has not been determined.

In the retinal vasculature, AA and DHA are found in equal amounts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, suggesting that both substrates, and therefore their products, would likely be found in similar levels at the site of epoxide generation in the vasculature.

Therefore, in the context of this study, we believe that AUDA is functioning by sEH inhibition, because it is only efficacious when paired with exogenous epoxides.</p><p>TNF&#x003b1;-induced retinal leukostasis was adapted for use in this study as a model of low-grade chronic inflammation related to DR, as reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We chose to administer a dose of TNF&#x003b1; (50&#x02009;pg) to the vitreous cavity that was based on preliminary dose response profiles within ranges that reflect low-grade retinal inflammation similar to that observed in vitreous from patients with DR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Moreover, our reported induction of retinal leukostasis is comparable to that observed in rodent models of diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. The TNF&#x003b1; concentration we chose produced a significant increase in adherent retinal leukocytes with sufficient magnitude to test the addition of exogenous EET and EDP to achieve statistical significance in this acute model, while at the same time maintaining relevance to the low-grade state of inflammation observed in DR.</p><p>In our <italic>in vitro</italic> flow chamber experiments, we observed a partial inhibition of TNF&#x003b1;-induced leukocyte adherence compared to the complete mitigation of TNF&#x003b1;-induced leukostasis we observed in the acute mouse model of retinal inflammation. A number of reasons could explain the differences between these results. First, we narrowed our survey of inflammation-related molecular targets to VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 because they have been shown to mediate TNF&#x003b1;-induced leukostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>, and have precedence as EET-dependent targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, other targets are likely to contribute to leukocyte adherence in the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, such as E-selectin or P-selectin, and their levels may also be EET- and/or EDP-dependent. Furthermore, though EET and EDP were locally administered, they may exert additional anti-inflammatory actions on the circulating leukocytes. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments focused on the effects of EET and EDP on the retinal endothelial cells alone. Indeed, evidence from other studies suggests that these epoxides may also exert their effects on macrophages and monocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>. Hence, EET- and EDP-dependent effects on circulating cells may represent an important component of the <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenesis that is absent in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Hence, experiments designed to test EET- and EDP-dependent effects on circulating cells in the context of retinal leukostasis are currently ongoing in our laboratory. Lastly, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were performed in human-derived microvascular endothelial cells, and our <italic>in vivo</italic> endpoints were performed in mice. The published IC50 value for AUDA related the to inhibition of mouse sEH (18&#x02009;nM) is lower than that reported for the human variant (69&#x02009;nM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>. Therefore, AUDA is more potent for the mouse enzyme, and this may contribute to the improved efficacy observed in our mouse model.</p><p>This is the first study to directly compare the effects of EET and EDP on molecular and cellular events related to retinal vascular inflammation occurring in DR. While EDP has some bioactivities similar to those of EET, and in some cases demonstrating greater potencies such as in vasodilation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>, opposite biological outcomes have also been observed. For example, EDP has been reported to be anti-angiogenic whereas EET is likely to be pro-angiogenic depending on the specific experimental context<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>. In the present study we showed a similar potency for EET and EDP to reduce <italic>in vitro</italic> leukocyte adhesion and leukostasis in the mouse. This suggests that the mechanisms by which they exert their anti-inflammatory effects are similar. The mechanistic details of EET and EDP bioactivities remain undetermined. A specific receptor for epoxygenated fatty acids is yet to be identified, although they do signal through a number of pathways, including PPARs and GPCRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>. The majority of evidence supporting EET anti-inflammatory activity points to signaling pathways that converge on the transcription factor NF&#x003ba;B. Node <italic>et al</italic>. originally showed that 11,12-EET exerted anti-inflammatory effects in bovine aortic endothelial cells by inhibiting IKK activity and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation, thereby preventing NF&#x003ba;B translocation and initiation of pro-inflammatory mediator transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. While subsequent studies validated this finding, they were all performed in macrovascular endothelial cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that NF&#x003ba;B activation is inhibited by 11,12-EET or 19,20-EDP in microvascular endothelial cells, but not via I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation. Future studies will seek to identify novel signaling mechanisms by which these epoxides exert their anti-inflammatory effects on microvascular endothelial cells as opposed to those identified in various macrovascular endothelial cells.</p><p>Taken together, our data shows for the first time that 11,12-EET and 19,20-EDP, when combined with application of the sEH inhibitor AUDA, are similarly efficacious against TNF&#x003b1;-induced leukocyte adherence <italic>in vitro</italic> and leukostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both of these epoxides act in part by inhibiting the induction of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Based on the results of these studies, the addition of exogenous EET or EDP, along with their stabilization via sEH inhibitors, may represent a viable treatment strategy for DR. We believe that blocking retinal inflammation in the early stages of NPDR with EET and EDP therapy may prevent transition to PDR and its associated morbidities, including blindness. Future studies will be designed to optimize strategies focused on increasing concentrations of EET or EDP by chronic systemic administration in experimental models of DR to assess their effects over longer time courses of pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cell Culture</title><p>Primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC; Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA) were validated by assessing cytoplasmic VWF and uptake of Di-I-Ac-LDL.
