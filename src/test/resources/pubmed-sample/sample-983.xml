Understanding how subsistence resources have been affected by recent climate change, and may be affected by changes yet to come (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), is necessary to plan for food security in Alaska.</p><p>Evaluating changes to subsistence resources across a region as large and ecologically diverse as Alaska is challenging. However throughout Alaska, government, tribal and private environmental managers live and work in rural communities. These individuals are knowledgeable about the local environment and can provide a network for reporting on environmental change. Here, we report the observations of Alaska's environmental managers on recent trends in wild berry abundance.</p><p>Wild berries are valued as a traditional food and for medicinal purposes in rural Alaska, and berry picking is an important cultural activity (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Berries add diversity to the diets of people in rural areas and are an important alternative to domestic fruits, which in remote areas can be difficult to obtain and are expensive. Many species of wild berries have high antioxidant activity (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) that has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cognitive decline and cancer (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Consumption of wild berries has been encouraged as a means to improve health in Alaska's rural communities (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Berries also provide food to wildlife species that are important to subsistence harvest (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Thus, wild berries are important to cultural heritage, food security and human health in rural Alaska.</p><p>Despite their importance to rural communities, we know little regarding how berry-producing plants may be affected by climate change. Change in precipitation and temperature could affect berry production (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), as could changes in pollination rates (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Change in berry harvests could serve as an indicator of environmental modification at a landscape level.</p><p>In Alaska, there are approximately 50 species of plants that produce berries (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). People regularly consume berries from about half of those species (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, there is little published information regarding which species of berries are important to communities in different regions of the state. That information was needed to guide further monitoring and research on the effects of climate change on berry resources. Therefore, we conducted a survey in which we asked local environmental managers throughout Alaska: (a) to identify which species of berries were important to people in their community and (b) whether they perceived that the abundance of berries had changed in recent years. Our goals were to contrast species composition of the berry harvest among ecological regions of Alaska, and identify regions or species for which berry abundance was perceived to be changing.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Survey approach</title><p>Between November 2013 and February 2014, we distributed a survey to 3 groups of environmental managers that were knowledgeable about berries and their use: (a) the Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, (b) attendees of the Alaska Tribal Conference on Environmental Management (ATCEM) and (c) attendees of the Alaska Forum on the Environment (AFE). People in these groups were often tribal environmental professionals affiliated with the Environmental Protection Agency's Indian General Assistance Program. The survey was provided to the LEO network in an online format, whereas paper copies were distributed upon request to interested individuals at ATCEM and AFE. Contents of the online and paper surveys were the same. In conjunction with distribution of the survey, we held either an online webinar (LEO) or classroom seminars (ATCEM and AFE) to explain the species covered by the survey and its intent.</p><p>In the survey, we first asked people to identify the community in which they lived and the number of years they had lived there. We then asked questions about 12 types of berries that we believed were most likely to be picked in various regions of Alaska (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.circumpolarhealthjournal.net/index.php/ijch/rt/suppFiles/28704/0">Supplementary file</ext-link>). Some berries were combinations of species that were closely related and similar in appearance. We selected berries for inclusion in the survey based on discussions with berry users, on Pratt's (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) description of the palatability and use of berries, and from our personal knowledge. For each type of berry, we provided a picture of its fruit, a note on height of the plant, a map of its known distribution based on Hult&#x000e9;n (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and frequently used English common names. We asked if the berry occurred near the respondent's community. If they responded positively, we asked that they classify the importance of the berry to their community as either:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>It is very important. It is the berry that people pick most often</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is important. People sometimes pick this berry.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is not important. People rarely pick this berry.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>If the respondent indicated that people in their community picked a berry, we asked that they provide their perception of whether abundance and harvests of that berry had changed over the past 10 years:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>It is more abundant. The berry harvest is larger now than in previous years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is less abundant. We pick fewer berries of this species than we used to.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Its abundance has not changed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Its abundance is more variable from 1 year to the next than it used to be.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We considered that increased abundance or no change in abundance were indicators of certainty in berry harvests, and suggested that a family could plan whether to incorporate that berry into their diet. Conversely, decreased abundance or increased variability in abundance indicated uncertainty in harvests, and suggested that a family could not plan on that berry being available. For each berry, we also asked participants to indicate the volume of berries that families in their community picked on average, and the distance people travelled to the best berry-picking areas.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We summarized regional differences in berry importance based on Level I ecoregions of Alaska (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>). This classification broadly divides Alaska into 3 ecological zones (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) that also reflect distributions of Native cultures (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and some berry species (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The polar ecoregion of northern and western Alaska is a treeless, windswept region typically underlain by permafrost and in which land cover is mainly sedge and grass tundra, low shrubs and wetlands. It includes the montane regions of the Brooks Range. Native people who live in the polar ecoregion mainly include the Inupiaq of northern Alaska and the Yup'ik of Cup'ik people of western Alaska. The boreal ecoregion of interior Alaska is dominated by spruce and birch forests, but it includes alpine tundra in mountainous regions. There are many areas in the boreal ecoregion where forests give way to sedge meadows and ericaceous shrubs in poorly drained sites. Numerous groups of Athabascan people live in the boreal ecoregion. The maritime ecoregion occurs along the southern coast of Alaska and includes the more windswept areas of the maritime ecoregion on the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands of southwest Alaska. Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian mainly live in southeast Alaska. The Unangax and Alutiiq people mainly live in the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak Archipelago and Aleutian Islands of southwest Alaska.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Alaskan communities where environmental observers completed surveys on berry importance and abundance.

Although participants were not randomly selected from berry users in Alaska, thus precluding statistical inference to a larger population, they were individuals that were highly knowledgeable about local resources and harvests. Their insights are useful given that there is little published information on species composition or changes in abundance of wild berries that are harvested in rural Alaska.</p><p>People from across Alaska responded to the survey and most identified &#x0003e;1 type of berry that was very important to his or her community. The majority of respondents indicated that families in their communities picked &#x02265;19 litres of one or more species of berry. These results illustrate not only the broad geographic importance of berries to the state's rural communities, but also indicate that berries can significantly contribute to a families&#x02019; diet. The latter is especially true given that berries are often extended by mixing them with other foods to make agutak (Eskimo ice cream), jams and pies. People typically picked berries within 32 km of their community. Compared to other subsistence foods that people often have to travel longer distances to obtain, berries are important as a locally available resource that can be harvested with lower fuel costs (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>No single berry dominated harvests throughout Alaska. In each ecological region, and in some cases at the community level, there was a unique mix of favoured berries. Differences in the composition of berry harvest among ecological regions likely reflect differences in abundance of berry species. Cloudberry, crowberry and low-bush blueberry, the favoured species in the polar ecoregion, are distributed throughout Alaska. However, they are typically more abundant in the bog, tundra, heath and low-shrub communities that mainly comprise the polar ecoregion (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The distributions of salmonberry and high-bush blueberry, the most important species in the maritime ecoregion, are restricted to the temperate and subalpine forests, and coastal communities of southern Alaska (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In the maritime ecoregion, crowberry was also important to communities on the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands where this species is common (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Low-bush blueberry, lingonberry and raspberry, the favoured species in the boreal ecoregion, are common bog and forest understory plants (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Low-bush blueberry and lingonberry also occur in alpine tundra of the boreal ecoregion. Although local abundance is likely an important determinant of the species composition of berry harvests, cultural preferences could also influence berry selection.</p><p>Because environmental variables that influence berry production may vary among species (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), different species of berries may respond differently to climate warming. Our identification of important berries in each ecoregion is useful to select species that should be the focus of further monitoring and experimental work aimed towards predicting how berry resources will be affected by climate change.</p><p>
There was no agreement among observers within an ecoregion on whether abundance of a berry had changed. Even within communities, different observers often perceived changes differently for the same berry. This may partly reflect individual experiences with changes in berry harvests. Berry abundance can be highly variable across small geographic areas, possibly due to site-specific differences in environmental conditions (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Localized changes in productivity of individual berry patches may cause different observers to reach disparate conclusions on whether berry abundance has changed over time.</p><p>Although there was no agreement on trends in berry harvests, there was little to suggest that abundance had improved for any berry in recent years. Increased abundance was typically the least common response for each berry. Rather, for 7 of the 12 berries in our survey, the most common perception statewide was that berry harvests had become less reliable either due to declining abundance or increased annual variability. Flint et al. (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and Parlee et al. (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) reported that people in some Alaskan and Canadian communities were concerned about the effects of climate warming on berry harvests. Our findings suggest that recent changes in the abundance of some berries may provide a basis for those concerns. That perceived trends were dissimilar among berries is not surprising given that interspecific differences in reproductive strategies could influence how berry production is influenced by environmental change. For example, insect-pollinated species such as low-bush blueberry or cloudberry (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) may respond differently to environmental variation than species that are mainly wind pollinated such as crowberry (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), especially if weather conditions affect insect pollinators (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>There was some evidence of regional differences in berry trends. The perception that abundance had declined or become increasingly variable was more common for important berries in the polar and maritime ecoregions than in the boreal ecoregion. Low-bush blueberry was considered very important by &#x0003e;50% of respondents in both the boreal and polar ecoregions. However, the percentage of respondents who perceived abundance of low-bush blueberry to be declining or becoming increasingly variable was almost twice as large in the polar ecoregion (76%) than in the boreal ecoregion (41%). Thus, there may be underlying ecological changes that are having greater effects on berry resources in the coastal and tundra regions of Alaska. This is plausible given the large-scale environmental changes associated with temperature increase, permafrost deterioration, and coastal flooding and erosion in those regions (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Long-term declines in cloudberry and some other northern berry species have also been reported in Finland (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The survey neither does allow us to quantify the magnitude of change in berry abundance, nor clearly identify specific environmental conditions that may have affected berry productivity. Spatial and temporal patterns in production of many berries are inherently variable (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Increased variability in berry harvests does not necessarily mean that average harvests have declined. But, it does indicate that planning on a harvest is more difficult. Weather patterns in Alaska are expected to become more variable as a result of climate warming (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The increase in annual variation in berry abundance reported by many people may be evidence that on-going climatic fluctuation has influenced recent harvests of some berries. Increased amplitude in climatic fluctuation may exacerbate variation, resulting in greater uncertainty regarding future berry harvests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our survey highlights the importance of wild berries to rural communities throughout Alaska, and demonstrates the value of local environmental managers in monitoring resource change. In many communities, people perceive that over the past decade berry harvests have declined or have become more variable. As a result, people may be increasingly uncertain about future berry harvests. To better understand how berry harvests may be affected by environmental change, we recommend that (a) annual surveys of environmental managers and other berry users be conducted to monitor harvest trends (b), site-specific measures of plant species composition and berry abundance be conducted to correlate berry harvest with environmental variables and to detect plant community change and (c) experimental manipulations be increasingly conducted to identify environmental drivers of berry productivity and to develop predictive models of the effects of climate change on berry resources. We recommend that future monitoring and experimental studies focus on species that were identified as very important to communities in our survey. Also, that methods by which rural communities can increase their resilience to declining or more variable berry harvests be explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>How are your berries?
