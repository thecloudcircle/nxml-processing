Introduction</title><p>Since about 95% of swine farms in Western countries use Artificial Insemination (AI) with liquid-stored pig semen (resulting in an estimated mean fertility of 90%), its optimization in that sector is crucial [<xref rid="B1-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As any technique aimed at increasing reproductive performance needs to be contemplated, several approaches have been undertaken over recent years. Among these approaches is red-light irradiation, which increases both farrowing rates and litter sizes showing, however, significant variations across farms worldwide [<xref rid="B4-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, the literature remains inconsistent on how light-irradiation affects sperm function and its ability to modulate in vitro capacitation [<xref rid="B4-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this context, additional research about the mechanism/s underlying the mammalian sperm response to red-light is warranted.</p><p>At present, three potential mechanisms have been suggested to be related to the response of mammalian sperm to red-light (reviewed in [<xref rid="B8-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). The first one hypothesizes that light interacts with plasma membrane receptors, such as those belonging to the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family, linked to thermotaxis. The TRP family is a highly heterogeneous group and only proteins included in vanilloid TRP (TRPV), ankyrin TRP (TRPA) and melastanin TRP (TRPM) subfamilies are involved in the control of thermotaxis [<xref rid="B9-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As part of the first subfamily, TRPV4 has been demonstrated to be the most important temperature-sensitive ion channel in mammalian sperm [<xref rid="B10-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The second mechanism is related to the ability of light to interact with specific receptors belonging to the opsins family. In this respect, not only has rhodopsin, a retinal-dependent opsin sensitive to red-light [<xref rid="B11-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], been identified in mouse and human spermatozoa [<xref rid="B12-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but also other opsins, such as blue light-sensitive melanopsin, ultraviolet-responsive neuropsin and PNN3/encephalopsin [<xref rid="B12-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While the exact function of these opsins in mammalian sperm still remains unknown, mounting evidence suggests that these proteins&#x02014;especially rhodopsin&#x02014;are involved, together with TRP proteins, in the modulation of sperm thermotaxis [<xref rid="B12-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B20-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Finally, the third mechanism contemplates the direct effect of irradiation on intracellular light-sensitive proteins (photosensitizers), such as mitochondria cytochromes, which are crucial for the regulation of the overall mitochondrial function. Cytochromes are essential components of the mitochondrial electron chain and play a vital role in the control of oxidative phosphorylation, generation of reactive oxygen (ROS) and apoptosis [<xref rid="B21-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A common characteristic of cytochromes is the presence of a heme group, which accepts and donates electrons across the electron chain [<xref rid="B22-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since the heme group is light-sensitive, cytochromes are known to react against specific light wavelengths depending on their structure [<xref rid="B24-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, whereas cytochrome P450 has a higher absorption peak at 450 nm, other cytochrome complexes, such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, has two peaks (at 610&#x02013;630 nm and 660&#x02013;680 nm) [<xref rid="B24-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Against this background, this study aimed to examine how irradiation of mammalian sperm with red-light affects mitochondrial function, since this is one of the hypothesized mechanisms of action. With this purpose, and using the pig as a model, semen stored at 17 &#x000b0;C was irradiated with red-light for 1, 5 and 10 min, in the presence/absence of oligomycin A, a well-known specific inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase or carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a potent disruptor of the electron chain function. Therefore, this work makes a step towards understanding the action of red light on, specifically, sperm mitochondria and, hence, on the overall sperm function, by investigating the red-light action on the electron chain. Our hypothesis is that the use of these two agents should disrupt electron chain function and abolish the stimulating effects of red-light upon mitochondrial function when they block the crucial, involved part of the electron chain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-cells-09-02546"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-cells-09-02546"><title>2.1. Semen Samples</title><p>Semen samples were provided by a commercial farm (Servicios Gen&#x000e9;ticos Porcinos, S.L. Roda de Ter, Spain) and came from 17 separate boars. Animals were post-pubertal (2&#x02013;3 years old), healthy and belonged to the Pi&#x000e9;train breed. Boar studs were housed in strictly climate-controlled conditions, fed with a standard diet and provided with water ad libitum. Semen was collected manually through the gloved-hand method, and the obtained sperm-rich fractions were immediately diluted at 17 &#x000b0;C to a final concentration of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> sperm/mL in a commercial extender (Duragen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Magapor, S.L.; Ejea de los Caballeros, Zaragoza, Spain). Diluted semen was split into 90 mL commercial AI doses, and two doses of each ejaculate were transported at 17 &#x000b0;C to our laboratory for 60 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-cells-09-02546"><title>2.2. Ethics</title><p>Pig ejaculates utilized in this study were not collected for the unique purpose of investigation, but for their commercial use. Thus, the farm provided us with some doses, and the remaining ones were used for AI. Therefore, there was no need for any specific ethical approval to perform this work, as no animal was manipulated by the authors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-cells-09-02546"><title>2.3. Experimental Design</title><p>Upon arrival, samples were confirmed to fulfill quality standards, which were &#x02265;80% membrane-intact spermatozoa (SYBR14<sup>+</sup>/PI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), &#x02265;85% morphologically normal spermatozoa and &#x02265;70% total motile spermatozoa. Following this, each semen sample was split into separate 1.5 mL aliquots that were subjected to three red-light irradiation protocols (LED, 620&#x02013;630 nm; PhastBlue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, IUL, S.L.; Barcelona, Spain). These three protocols consisted of exposing sperm to red-light for 1 (1&#x02032;), 5 (5&#x02032;) or 10 min (10&#x02032;). In all cases, the temperature within the PhastBlue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system was maintained at 20 &#x000b0;C. Controls consisted of 1.5 mL tubes kept at 20 &#x000b0;C in the dark for 10 min. In addition to the aforementioned, semen samples were also exposed to the same three protocols (i.e., 1&#x02032;, 5&#x02032; and 10&#x02032;) or non-exposed (control) in the presence of either 5 &#x000b5;M oligomycin A or 5 &#x000b5;M FCCP. Both agents were added to semen samples 10 min prior to exposure to red-light. These two concentrations were chosen based on previous works [<xref rid="B25-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and preliminary, dose&#x02013;response experiments and corresponded to those that showed a complete inhibitory effect without causing toxicity, which was based on sperm viability and acrosome integrity data.</p><p>Following irradiation, samples were used to evaluate sperm motility through a computer-assisted sperm analysis system (CASA); sperm membrane and acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular ROS and calcium levels by flow cytometry; O<sub>2</sub> consumption; intracellular ATP levels; and total cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (CCO) activity. In the case of intracellular ATP levels and total CCO activity, samples were first centrifuged at 2000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> and 20 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and the resulting pellet was frozen by plunging samples into liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Samples were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until use.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-cells-09-02546"><title>2.4. Sperm Motility</title><p>Sperm motility was determined through a CASA system (Integrated Sperm Analysis System V1.0; Proiser; Valencia, Spain), based on the settings and parameters described previously [<xref rid="B30-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The following kinematic parameters were evaluated: curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight line velocity (VSL), average pathway velocity (VAP), linearity coefficient (LIN), straightness coefficient (STR), wobble coefficient (WOB), amplitude of lateral head displacement (mALH), beat cross frequency (BCF), dance (DNC, VCL &#x000d7; ALH), absolute mean angular displacement (absMAD) and algebraic mean angular displacement (algMAD). Briefly, samples were warmed at 38 &#x000b0;C for 5 min in a water bath prior to placing 6 &#x000b5;L into a 20-micron Leja<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Standard Count Chamber Slide (Leja Products B.V.; Nieuw Vennep, The Netherlands). Three replicates of 1000 sperm each were evaluated before calculating the corresponding mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM). Total motility was defined as the percentage of sperm with VAP &#x02265; 10 &#x000b5;m/s, whereas progressive motility was considered to be the percentage of motile sperm with a STR &#x02265; 45%. Individual kinematic parameters (VSL, VCL, VAP, LIN, STR and BCF) were used to determine sperm motile subpopulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-cells-09-02546"><title>2.5. Flow Cytometry</title><p>Flow cytometry was used to determine plasma membrane and acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and intracellular levels of superoxides, peroxides and calcium, following the recommendations of the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry [<xref rid="B31-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In all analyses, sperm concentration was previously adjusted to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> spermatozoa/mL in a final volume of 500 &#x000b5;L with Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS), and three technical replicates were evaluated. Samples were examined using a Cell Laboratory QuantaSC cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA), and the sheath flow rate was set at 4.17 &#x000b5;L/min. Electronic volume (EV) and side scatter (SS) were recorded in a log-linear mode (EV/SS dot plots) for 10,000 events per replicate. The analyzer threshold was adjusted on the EV channel to exclude subcellular debris (particle diameter &#x0003c; 7 &#x000b5;m) and cell aggregates (particle diameter &#x0003e; 12 &#x000b5;m), and compensation was used to minimize fluorescence spill-over into a different channel. Information on all events was collected with List-mode Data files (EV, SS, FL1, FL2 and FL3) and processed using the Cell Lab QuantaSC MPL Analysis Software (version 1.0; Beckman Coulter). In all assessments, data were corrected using the procedure described by Petrunkina et al.

Three separate sperm populations were identified.

Debris and non-sperm particles were detected as SYBR14<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/PI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and were not taken into account to calculate the percentages of the three sperm populations. Single-stained samples were used to set EV gain, FL1 and FL3 PMT-voltages and for compensation of FL1 spill-over into the FL3-channel (2.45%).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5dot2-cells-09-02546"><title>2.5.2. Acrosome Integrity</title><p>Acrosome integrity was determined through staining with peanut agglutinin from <italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic> conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-PNA) and ethidium homodimer (EthD-1), following the protocol set by Cooper and Yeung [<xref rid="B34-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and adapted to pig spermatozoa by Rocco et al.

Discussion</title><p>The present study clearly indicates that the effects of red LED light on mammalian sperm function are related with changes in the mitochondrial electronic chain activity. Moreover, the impact of red-light appears to rely on the time of exposure, as indicated by the differences observed between protocols. Regarding the effects of red-light on the mitochondrial electronic chain, this could be explained through different hypothesis. The main one would be underpinned by the direct action on mitochondrial photosensitizers. In effect, crucial components of the electronic chain, such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, are sensitive to light at a wavelength range from 630 to 660 nm [<xref rid="B24-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This sensitivity could explain our CCO activity results and would support the impact of red-light on mammalian sperm function. Indeed, while electron chain activity is usually related to energy production [<xref rid="B42-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it is also involved in the modulation of the overall eukaryotic cell function. In this respect, the electron chain plays a pivotal role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), since mitochondria are the most important generating source of ROS in eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="B44-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition, cytochrome complexes are also involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [<xref rid="B45-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and both ROS generation and modulation of apoptotic-like changes are crucial in eliciting and controlling sperm capacitation [<xref rid="B21-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, red light-induced changes in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> complex activity could ultimately affect how sperm capacitate and which their lifespan is.</p><p>Our results indicate that the presence of oligomycin A in non-irradiated sperm decreases O<sub>2</sub> consumption, although this reduction is not concomitant with a complete inhibition of motility or a decrease in intracellular ATP levels. These results differ from others previously published in which oligomycin A did abolish motility without modifying either O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate or ATP content [<xref rid="B46-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These separate effects could be explained by differences between experimental conditions. In effect, whereas the study by Rami&#x000f3;-Lluch et al. [<xref rid="B46-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] was performed under in vitro capacitation conditions, the current work was centered on semen stored in a commercial extender, which is specifically designed to maintain sperm activity/metabolism as low as possible. Related with this, it is worth mentioning that our results match with a recent study that used liquid-stored semen and tested the effects of oligomycin A and FCCP [<xref rid="B47-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the light of the aforementioned, one could suggest that the different conditions provided to sperm either by a capacitating medium or by a commercial extender would lead cells to be kept under a different functional status, which, in turn, would support separate reactivity against agents such as oligomycin A. In this context, it is worth bearing in mind that oligomycin A inhibits the activity of mitochondrial ATP synthase via binding its regulatory F0 subunit complex [<xref rid="B48-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The F0 subunit complex modulates the proton flux that ultimately activates ATP synthase [<xref rid="B49-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Since this means that the activity of the F0 subunit complex relies upon the precise proton flux, one could hypothesize that the inhibitory effect of oligomycin A could be different depending on that flux. This would imply that in conditions in which mitochondrial activity is very low or basal, such as those of this work, the effects of oligomycin A would be much less pronounced than in conditions with a stimulated mitochondrial activity, such as those of Rami&#x000f3;-Lluch et al. [<xref rid="B46-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Regarding the results observed in both ATP content and sperm motility, Marin et al. [<xref rid="B50-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that when pig sperm are maintained in conditions similar to those of the current work, not only are ATP levels much lower than those of Rami&#x000f3;-Lluch et al. [<xref rid="B46-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but ATP is mainly produced via glycolysis. Thus, the combination of different ATP levels with separate glycolysis/mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation balance could be on the basis of the observed differences in both oligomycin A-sensitivity and specific motility parameters of sperm incubated in capacitating conditions or preserved at 17 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>Results observed for JC1-staining and motile sperm subpopulations suggest that the effects of red LED light on mammalian sperm are not homogeneous, but heavily rely upon the specific functional status of each individual spermatozoon. In fact, not only do the observed percentages of spermatozoa with high and intermediate MMP and their JC1<sub>agg</sub>/JC1<sub>mon</sub> ratios support that the time of exposure to red-light has a different impact on mitochondrial membrane potential but also that not all spermatozoa exhibit the same response. Confocal microscope images corroborated this hypothesis, despite the distribution of JC1<sub>agg</sub> and JC1<sub>mon</sub> along the mitochondrial piece differing between the control and oligomycin A and FCCP treatments. In addition, the different response of each spermatozoon to red-light agrees with the presence of separate sperm populations based on JC1-staining [<xref rid="B51-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and also concur with our motile sperm subpopulations data. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the different response to red LED light of each spermatozoon also induces variations in the motile subpopulation structure, in a similar fashion to when sperm are cryopreserved or subjected to in vitro capacitation [<xref rid="B30-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B52-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the effects of light-stimulation and the presence of oligomycin A and FCCP on ROS levels, one should take into consideration two crucial aspects. The first is related to the low ROS levels found in pig spermatozoa under our experimental conditions. These low levels have already been reported [<xref rid="B32-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B54-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and have been related to the low metabolic rate of ejaculated, non-capacitated pig spermatozoa. In these conditions, pig sperm metabolism is mainly diverted to glycolysis rather than to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [<xref rid="B50-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and sperm cells show low activity rates for their electron chain. Related with this, the second aspect that needs to be emphasized is that, under our experimental conditions, one should not expect much effect from any treatment/irradiation pattern on ROS levels, as we observed in this study. On the other hand, taking into account that, in all cases, ROS production should be low in our experimental conditions, the cell mechanisms devoted to the modulation of intracellular ROS levels, such as those related to glutathione, should be fully active in those sperm cells. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the marginal impact on ROS levels under our experimental conditions together with the active mechanisms intended to control intracellular ROS levels could explain that the observed variations in intracellular peroxides and superoxides were so small.</p><p>Our results indicate that irradiating pig sperm with red-light induces, in all cases, an increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate, which was abolished by the addition of oligomycin A but was potentiated by FCCP, especially when sperm cells were light-stimulated for 1 min. As far as the effects of oligomycin A are concerned, it is worth mentioning that previous studies reported that pig sperm incubated in a capacitating medium containing that inhibitor do not show a decrease in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates [<xref rid="B41-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This apparent discrepancy could be linked to the fact that, compared with sperm cells subjected to the activation induced by capacitating media, the metabolic conditions and hence mitochondrial activity of pig sperm are completely different when cells are incubated in a basal medium that, as the one used herein, maintains very low metabolic rates. In effect, while activated sperm, such as those tested in previous studies [<xref rid="B41-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], would have mechanism/s that maintain the rhythm of the Krebs cycle regardless of the ATP synthase activity rate, non-capacitated sperm would maintain a close relationship between the activity of the Krebs cycle and ATP synthase. In this context, we can only speculate that one possible explanation for these differences could be related to mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Thus, this issue warrants further research, including experiments addressing the role of mitochondrial activity in the control of pig sperm capacitation.</p><p>Still related to O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates, and as aforementioned, our results indicate that not only did irradiation increase those rates, but the impact was even more apparent when FCCP was present and sperm were light-stimulated for 1 min. Regarding the mechanism/s through which irradiation with red-light increases O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates, we could raise two hypothesizes. The first one would be related to a direct effect of light on some point/s of the Krebs cycle complex. In fact, proteins such as pyruvate dehydrogenase have been reported to be sensitive to light [<xref rid="B55-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Following this, one could suggest that irradiation could act on these light-sensitive structures of the Krebs cycle, modifying their activity, which would be reliant upon the light-stimulation pattern. On the other hand, our results also suggest that FCCP has an additive effect on the acceleration of the Krebs cycle, which could be related to the ability of FCCP to deregulate the electron chain, which would, in turn, lead to an uncontrolled acceleration of this system. Moreover, the absence of significant additive effects of FCCP on the O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates of sperm irradiated for 5 or 10 min could be explained by the fact that these sperm cells would have already reached the maximal level, so that FCCP could not further increase these rates significantly. All these hypotheses support that further research on this subject is warranted.</p><p>The interpretation of results regarding the effects of light, oligomycin A and FCCP on the structure of motile sperm subpopulations is a very complex matter. In this respect, our results indicated that the presence of both oligomycin A and FCCP decreased the percentages of sperm with rapid motion characteristics, as the decrease in Subpopulations 2 and 3 showed. This was especially apparent when oligomycin A was present, which suggests that mitochondrial ATP production is very important to maintain fast sperm motility, despite the fact that the overall intracellular ATP levels were not significantly decreased. This effect of oligomycin A has already been described by our group under capacitating conditions [<xref rid="B41-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], thus suggesting a relationship between sperm motility and the entire oxidative phosphorylation mechanism beyond the mere ATP synthesis. However, again, we can raise this hypothesis, but further investigations must be carried out to understand this phenomenon completely. Regarding the effects of irradiation, our data indicate that not only was irradiation unable to counteract the effects of both oligomycin A and FCCP, but it did not affect the percentages of slower sperm, as observed when sperm were irradiated for 5 min. These results differ from those obtained when sperm are irradiated for 10 min, allowed to rest for 10 min and irradiated again for 10 min, as published before [<xref rid="B4-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. An explanation for these differences could be that the precise effect of light would heavily rely upon the irradiation timing applied which, in turn, would be related with the specific energy load applied on cells. It is very likely that a specific and narrow energy load range could have specific effects on sperm mitochondrial function that would affect motility in one way, whereas other energy load ranges induced by different irradiation patterns could have other effects. In fact, the specific effects observed for each irradiation pattern (i.e., 1, 5 and 10 min) on the activity of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase would agree with that hypothesis. In effect, the applied irradiation regimes could modulate cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity, which takes part in the mitochondrial electron chain; this could have concomitant, separate effects on other sperm function parameters that, such as sperm motility, are modulated by the electron chain and subsequent mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Indeed, taking into account that recent studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between mitochondrial ATP production and the regulation of sperm motility [<xref rid="B42-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], one could reasonably suggest the specific energy load induced by irradiation is related to the specific rate of electron chain and motility patterns. However, further in-depth studies will be needed to verify this hypothesis.</p><p>The changes observed for the intracellular calcium levels are also difficult to explain. While no treatment affected the percentage of cells with high intramitochondrial calcium levels, the intensity of calcium stain was only increased when sperm cells were irradiated for 5 min. Remarkably, that augment was abolished by both oligomycin A and FCCP. While we cannot ascertain a clear reason for this phenomenon, one could suggest that it could be related to the intrinsic activity of the electron chain. In this respect, it is worth noting that irradiating pig sperm for 5 min induced a strong increase in the activity of CCO, which was also abolished by both oligomycin A and FCCP. This increase was concomitant with that of mitochondrial calcium, which suggests a direct relationship between the electron chain and intramitochondrial calcium levels. In fact, such a relationship between mitochondrial calcium and CCO activity has already been reported [<xref rid="B56-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], thus suggesting a putative explanation for this observation. On the other hand, the decrease in Fluo3-intensity observed in sperm exposed to red-light for 10 min in the presence of FCCP is even more difficult to explain. In this case, a possible explanation could be related with some additional alterations caused by the modification of the electron chain activity induced by FCCP. Nevertheless, since the basis of this specific alteration remains unknown, further investigations are required.</p><p>Another interesting finding is that the effects of red LED light depend on the time of exposure. Related with this, our data are in agreement with previous studies about the sperm response to different red LED light patterns in terms of thermal resistance and in vitro capacitation [<xref rid="B4-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While the mechanisms underlying this different time-response remain to be elucidated, it is reasonable to assume that the energy supplied to the mitochondrial electron chain by red-light is proportional to the time of exposure and intensity. It is worth mentioning that each specific photon has different energy potential levels depending on the wavelength. Since energy goes from high levels at the ultraviolet range to low levels at the infrared one, photons in the red range utilized herein have relatively low energy levels (<uri xlink:href="http://www.photon.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~maruyama/nanoheat/Energy.pdf">http://www.photon.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~maruyama/nanoheat/Energy.pdf</uri>). Because the intensity of the device was kept constant in all protocols and wavelength ranged from 620 to 630 nm, the different pattern effects observed herein are likely to be due to the different times of exposure, which would fuel separate energy levels to mitochondrial photosensitizers. The energy supplied to photosensitizers modulate their rate of e<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> flux [<xref rid="B57-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As a consequence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that energy-linked, light-induced changes on the electron chain activity affect the overall mitochondria function, which leads to variations in sperm motility and intracellular ion fluxes [<xref rid="B57-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The final consequence is that different exposure times lead to a distinct impact on sperm function, depending on the exact energy level and the rate at which this energy is fueled into mitochondria. A corollary of this hypothesis is that any condition affecting the number of photons that reach cytochromes exerts a different impact on the sperm cell. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the sperm response to red-light has been suggested to be reliant upon other factors, such as the recipient in which sperm are contained [<xref rid="B6-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, explaining these effects should also take into consideration other potential sources of variation. The utilization of the same device and the same light regime for sperm stored in similar recipients regarding volume and color has been reported to render distinct effects on the overall sperm function [<xref rid="B6-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In effect, differences in the storage time of sperm prior to light-stimulation between Luther et al. [<xref rid="B6-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Pezo et al. [<xref rid="B7-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] could explain these apparently inconsistent results. Whereas Luther et al. [<xref rid="B6-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] stored sperm for 14 h prior to irradiation, that time lasted about 1 h in Pezo et al. [<xref rid="B7-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is important, since the functional status of pig sperm is different under these two conditions. In support of this hypothesis, cryotolerance of pig sperm when previously stored at 15&#x02013;17 &#x000b0;C for 24 h is higher than when cryopreserved immediately after collection [<xref rid="B58-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These differences have been linked with proteins related to the cell resilience to withstand environmental changes, such as heat shock protein 70 (HSPA1A), which shows much higher serine-phosphorylation levels after 24 h of storage at 15&#x02013;17 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B58-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, the functional sperm status is likely to lead to different sensitiveness to light-provided energy.</p><p>In spite of the aforementioned, there could be other factors that modulate the effects of red-light. This includes the presence of light-sensitive receptors, such as opsins [<xref rid="B20-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and transient receptor potential proteins (TRP; see [<xref rid="B60-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]), in mammalian spermatozoa. While the exact role of these receptors in sperm is not completely known, the regulation of thermotaxis has been suggested to be one of their most probable functions [<xref rid="B17-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thermotaxis could be, in fact, an important modulator of light-stimulation, since mammalian sperm are sensitive to environmental temperature changes as low as 0.0006 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B63-cells-09-02546" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Given that these small changes cannot be controlled by devices such as the one used to irradiate sperm in this study, it is reasonable to suggest that red-light stimulation could also act through inducing temperature changes higher than 0.0006 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-cells-09-02546"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that the effects induced by red LED light stimulation on mammalian sperm are related to mitochondrial photosensitizers, such as CCO, modifying mitochondrial electron chain activity. In addition, this study has also shown that the impact of red-light depends on the precise, previous sperm functional status and on the time of exposure. These findings do not exclude, however, that this mitochondrial mechanism acts together with thermotaxis via other receptors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the technical support from Estela Garcia-Bonavila, Sandra Recuero, Ariadna Delgado-Berm&#x000fa;dez, Sebasti&#x000e1;n Bonilla-Correal and Yentel Mateo-Otero.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-cells-09-02546"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/12/2546/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/12/2546/s1</uri>.

Different superscript letters indicate significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) differences between treatments within a given irradiation pattern (non-irradiated, light-stimulation for 1 min, light-stimulation for 5 min or light-stimulation for 10 min). Results are expressed as mean &#x000b1; S.E.M. for seven experiments. Abbreviations: VCL, curvilinear velocity; VSL, straight line velocity; VAP, average pathway velocity; LIN, linearity coefficient; STR, straightness coefficient; WOB, wobble (oscillation) coefficient; ALH, amplitude of lateral head displacement; BCF, beat cross frequency; DNC, dance (VCL &#x000d7; ALH); absMAD, absolute mean angular displacement; algMAD, algebraic mean angular displacement.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
