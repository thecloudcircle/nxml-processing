This length for a window was chosen as likely to include regions within which inserts were likely to influence expression of the relevant gene.

</p></sec><sec><title>Genes involved in fosfomycin susceptibility</title><p>Whilst exposure to different concentrations of fosfomycin identified some concentration-dependent genes, 31 were involved in susceptibility under all fosfomycin conditions (Table&#x02009;<xref rid="dkaa296-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S3</xref>). These included the majority of known, chromosomally encoded loci that determine fosfomycin susceptibility, with strong signals identified for <italic>murA</italic>, the target for fosfomycin, <italic>glpT</italic> and <italic>cyaA</italic>. This validates the specificity of TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> in identifying genes involved in fosfomycin susceptibility. The TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> method also proved able to assay essential genes. For example, <italic>murA</italic> is an essential gene but mutants with inserts that are positioned upstream and in the same orientation as <italic>murA</italic> were highly enriched in the presence of IPTG (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F1">1</xref>). These mutants will over-express <italic>murA</italic>, which will help the target saturate the activity of fosfomycin. The high density of the library also allows very high-resolution analysis; for example, <italic>cyaA</italic> was identified as a significant mechanism but enrichment of inserts was restricted to that part of the gene encoding the regulatory domain (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F1">1</xref>). Mutations within this domain (but not the remainder of the protein) have previously been reported as being important in determining fosfomycin susceptibility and TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> identified that part of the gene encoding this domain. However, no signal was identified at the <italic>uhpT</italic> locus, which has also previously been implicated in fosfomycin import, although it is not expressed in the test conditions so knockout mutations would have had no selective advantage.

The phosphonate uptake and degradation operon comprises 14 genes (<italic>phnCDEFGHIJKLMNOP</italic>) coding for an ABC importer (PhnCDE), a regulator (PhnF), a multi-subunit methylphosphonate degradation complex (PhnGHIJKL), which includes the carbon&#x02013;phosphorus bond cleavage activity (PhnGHIJ), and additional functions required to yield phosphate from phosphonate (PhnMNOP). The <italic>phn</italic> operon has been reported to be cryptic in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 due to three, not two, copies of an 8&#x02009;bp tandem repeat within <italic>phnE</italic> (encoding the integral membrane component of the importer) that cause a frameshift.<xref rid="dkaa296-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Sequencing of the parent strain of the transposon library, and mapping of reads obtained from TraDIS experiments after fosfomycin exposure confirmed that the BW25113 parent strain, used to make the transposon mutant library, also has three copies of the tandem repeat within <italic>phnE</italic>, which should therefore not be expressed. However, following growth with fosfomycin at 2&#x000d7; MIC, transposon insertions in the <italic>phnC</italic>, <italic>phnE</italic> and <italic>phnF</italic> genes conferred a large selective advantage (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F2">2</xref>a). These insertions are all oriented such that the transposon promoter will transcribe the rest of the operon, most likely leading to its expression, and suggesting that the phosphonate degradation complex encoded by these genes can modify or degrade fosfomycin. At lower concentrations (0.5&#x000d7; MIC) of fosfomycin, insertion mutations in the same orientation were observed across most of the operon but not within <italic>phnMNOP</italic>, suggesting that at this lower concentration these gene products alone provide sufficient inactivation of fosfomycin to confer a significant selective advantage.</p><fig id="dkaa296-F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Inactivation of the <italic>phn</italic> (a) and <italic>pst</italic> (b) operons is selected by fosfomycin.

As expected, BW25113 was inhibited by the MIC. Growth of both the <italic>leuO</italic> mutants was also inhibited at the MIC, and this is also expected as the TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> data predicted that altered <italic>leuO</italic> expression, rather than inactivation, was important for reduced fosfomycin susceptibility. For all the other mutant pairs, one or both showed a 2- to 4-fold increase in MIC of fosfomycin compared with the BW25113 parent strain. These mutant pairs included three for the <italic>phn</italic> operon and both the <italic>pst</italic> mutants tested (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F3">3</xref>). Given the indicated role for the phosphonate uptake system, we tested whether addition of an exogenous phosphonate would impact fosfomycin susceptibility and found that 100&#x02009;mg/L of the bis-phosphonate etidronate increased the MIC of fosfomycin against BW25113 by 2- to 4-fold. In addition, growth curve experiments indicated that the addition of 100&#x02009;mg/L etidronate resulted in improvements in growth rate of BW25113 cultures supplemented with different concentrations of fosfomycin (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S3</xref>).

The data showed the sensitivity of this approach, with many of the known chromosomal mechanisms of resistance being identified as important contributors to fosfomycin susceptibility (apart from <italic>uhpT</italic>, which is not expressed in the assay conditions used). Additionally, TraDIS-Xpress was also able to identify domains within targets that are important; for example, the regulatory domain of CyaA is known to be involved in fosfomycin susceptibility by controlling cAMP levels and therefore expression of <italic>glpT</italic> and <italic>uhpT.</italic><xref rid="dkaa296-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Inactivation of the CyaA domain responsible for this function results in lower expression of both GlpT and UhpT importers, and reduced fosfomycin susceptibility. TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> clearly indicated the role for this regulatory domain but not the rest of <italic>cyaA</italic> (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F1">1</xref>). In line with the identification of <italic>cyaA</italic> as important, our data also identified inactivation of <italic>glpT</italic> as providing a selective advantage with fosfomycin as expected, although there was no signal for <italic>uhpT</italic>.</p><p>Traditional TraDIS experiments have not been able to assay many essential genes, which often reduce susceptibility to antibiotics. However, the current work demonstrates that TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> did assay essential genes following growth in fosfomycin, as exemplified by the selection of many mutants with transposon insertions upstream of <italic>murA</italic> and oriented to promote transcription from the outward-transcribing transposon promoter. These insertions most likely increase expression, increasing the number of copies of MurA beyond that which can be inhibited by fosfomycin.</p><p>In addition to genes known to be involved in fosfomycin resistance, a wider set of new loci were also identified as contributing to susceptibility to the drug (Table&#x02009;<xref rid="dkaa296-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These included genes involved in glucose metabolism, which are likely to mediate expression of the glucose importers that facilitate transport of fosfomycin across the inner membrane. This extends our current understanding of how central metabolism can impact susceptibility to fosfomycin and shows how specific growth conditions and associated gene expression may influence susceptibility to this drug by altering gene regulation.</p><p>These experiments also found that knockout mutations in <italic>mutL</italic> and <italic>tatD</italic> were selectively disadvantageous for growth in fosfomycin. These genes encode DNA repair functions, suggesting that fosfomycin causes some DNA damage resulting from altered metabolism following inhibition of the primary target, MurA, and consequent bactericidal effect. This has been proposed as a common impact of many bactericidal drugs.<xref rid="dkaa296-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33&#x02013;35</sup></xref></p><p>The TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> data indicated that transposon insertions into the phosphonate uptake and catabolism operon (<italic>phnCDEFGHILJLMNO</italic>) provided a considerable selective advantage for growth in fosfomycin. All these insertions were oriented such that the transposon outward-transcribing promoter would promote expression of downstream genes, suggesting that the products of this system can inactivate fosfomycin. At 0.5&#x000d7; MIC fosfomycin, insertions were found across most of the operon, but not within <italic>phnMNOP</italic>, suggesting that at lower fosfomycin concentrations one or more of these functions is sufficient for fosfomycin inactivation. At the highest fosfomycin concentration investigated, insertions were upstream of <italic>phnG</italic>, and orientated towards <italic>phnG-P</italic>, thereby over-expressing the lyase components. The lack of transposon insertions in the reverse orientation within <italic>phnCDE</italic> indicates the selective advantage is not likely to be due to inactivation of transport, which should remain inactive throughout the experiment due to the <italic>phnE</italic> frameshift mutation. There was, however, a phenotype for the <italic>phnC</italic> mutant, and <italic>phnCD</italic> will be expressed as they are upstream of the frameshift even though <italic>phnE</italic> is inactive. Therefore, these results indicate that it is most likely expression of the phosphonate metabolism system, <italic>phnGHIJKLMNOP</italic>, that provides a selective advantage during growth with fosfomycin.</p><p>Whilst UhpT and GlpT are known import systems for fosfomycin, mutation of either the PhnC-M or PstBCSA system was strongly selected by fosfomycin exposure (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F2">2</xref>).</p><p>The PstBCAS phosphate transporter was also identified as a likely mechanism of fosfomycin entry into the cell, as insertion mutations into the <italic>pstBCAS</italic> operon conferred a selective advantage during growth with fosfomycin (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F2">2</xref>). These data suggest that multiple importers, including novel systems, are involved in fosfomycin susceptibility. Testing of defined mutants in both the Phn and Pst systems confirmed a phenotype, with the mutants able to grow above the MIC of the drug (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F3">3</xref>).</p><p>In addition, growth in the presence of the bis-phosphonate etidronate resulted in limited but consistent (2-fold increase in the MIC) rescue of growth in the presence of fosfomycin. Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S4</xref> shows the impact of addition of 100&#x02009;mg/L of etidronate on growth in the presence of a series of concentrations of fosfomycin, with improved growth evident at most concentrations (etidronate had no intrinsic antimicrobial activity). These data are supportive of specific phosphonate importers being important routes of entry into the cell for fosfomycin. The potential for phosphonate moieties to mediate import of molecules into the cell may have potential utility. A major challenge in therapy is getting drugs into cells and new routes to modify molecules and promote their uptake are likely to enhance efficacy of drugs. It has become clear in recent years that most drugs cross the inner membrane by active import rather than passive diffusion and identifying side groups that may improve uptake by changing importer specificity is important.<xref rid="dkaa296-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p><p>One major worry with some drugs is selection of cross-resistance to other agents, often mediated by generic mechanisms of resistance, including multidrug efflux and/or porins, where expression changes can influence accumulation of many drugs.<xref rid="dkaa296-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> There was not a strong signal for these pathways after fosfomycin exposure, which suggests that the major mechanisms of fosfomycin resistance (we propose a model in Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkaa296-F4">4</xref>) are likely to be relatively specific and not influence other classes of agent.
