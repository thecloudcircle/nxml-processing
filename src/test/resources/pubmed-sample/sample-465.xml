Second, we wanted to compare inequalities in the use of PNC between facility births and home births and to determine inequalities in the use of PNC among mothers with high-risk births.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Rich&#x02013;poor ratios and concentration indices for maternity care were estimated using the third round of the District Level Household Survey conducted in India in 2007&#x02013;08. Binary logistic regression models were used to examine the socio-economic inequalities associated with use of PNC after adjusting for relevant socio-economic and demographic characteristics. PNC for both mothers and newborns was substantially lower than the care received during pregnancy and child birth. Only 44&#x00025; of mothers in India at the time of survey received any care within 48 hours after birth. Likewise, only 45&#x00025; of newborns received check-up within 24 hours of birth. Mothers who had home births were significantly less likely to have received PNC than those who had facility births, with significant differences across the socio-economic strata. Moreover, the rich-poor gap in PNC use was significantly wider for mothers with birth complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>PNC use has been unacceptably low in India given the risks of mortality for mothers and babies shortly after birth. However, there is evidence to suggest that effective use of pregnancy and childbirth care in health facilities led to better PNC. There are also significant socio-economic inequalities in access to PNC even for those accessing facility-based care. The coverage of essential PNC is inadequate, especially for mothers from economically disadvantaged households. The findings suggest the need for strengthening PNC services to keep pace with advances in coverage for care at birth and prenatal services in India through targeted policy interventions.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The highest risk of death for both the mother and her newborn occurs at the time of childbirth or immediately in the period after birth. Ensuring appropriate postnatal care is critical to safeguarding maternal and newborn health <xref rid="pone.0037037-Sines1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037037-Baqui1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. More than two-thirds of newborn deaths occur within the first week after birth and of these, most deaths occur in the first 24 hours of birth <xref rid="pone.0037037-Lawn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This is also the case with maternal deaths where almost two-thirds tend to occur in the postnatal period <xref rid="pone.0037037-Ronsman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. India is no exception to this. About 39&#x00025; of neonatal deaths occur on the first day of life in India, about 57&#x00025; during the first three days <xref rid="pone.0037037-Rasaily1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and the majority of maternal deaths occur between the third trimester and the end of the first week after birth <xref rid="pone.0037037-International1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Promoting antenatal care and skilled attendance at birth is clearly not enough for improving maternal and child health. The WHO guidelines on postnatal care recommend essential routine postnatal care for all mothers and their newborns, extra care for low birth weight and small babies, and early identification and referral or management of emergency conditions. The guidelines further recommend postnatal visits within 6 to 12 hours after birth, and follow-up visits from 3 to 6 days, at 6 weeks, and then at 6 months <xref rid="pone.0037037-World1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Strategies aimed at promoting universal access to postnatal care have been recommended for several years <xref rid="pone.0037037-World2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and these interventions can have measurable and sustained impact in reducing neonatal and maternal mortality <xref rid="pone.0037037-Sines1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Yet, despite governmental initiatives and policy efforts, there is a lack of follow-up after childbirth. Moreover, mothers often only seek postnatal care in the event of complications after birth. Poverty, lack of schooling, poor knowledge, and inadequate follow-up services in healthcare systems deter women from seeking postnatal care. To date, there has not been any systematic national level analysis of population data to understand the levels and socio-economic differentials in the use of postnatal care in India. Little evidence exists on the extent and timing of postnatal care and how these differ between women who received home and institutional care at birth.</p><p>A continuum of care throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period is critically important in India where both mothers and children are vulnerable to a range of health risks resulting from the vicious cycle of malnutrition and poverty. Moreover, despite a recent decline in infant mortality rates, there is little subsequent improvement in most Indian states <xref rid="pone.0037037-RGI1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037037-International2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The infant mortality rate was around 57 per 1000 live births in 2005&#x02013;06 and ranged between as low as 15 in Kerala to as high as 73 in Uttar Pradesh <xref rid="pone.0037037-International2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Maternal mortality rates were also high at 212 deaths per 100,000 live births, which varied widely across Indian states <xref rid="pone.0037037-RGI2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The Government of India introduced several policy measures and interventions to tackle the burden of infant and maternal mortality by reorienting the National Population Policy (2000), the National Health Policy (2002), the Reproductive and Child Health Programme (Phase I &#x02013; 1997&#x02013;2004, Phase II &#x02013; 2005&#x02013;2010), and the National Rural Health Mission (2005&#x02013;2012) &#x02013; wherein improving postnatal coverage was envisaged as one of the key intervention strategies to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates <xref rid="pone.0037037-MoHFW1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Unfortunately, although the policies have rightly emphasised on components such as skilled attendance and antenatal and institutional care at birth, they have overlooked the need to strengthen postnatal care within the reproductive health services.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0037037-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0037037.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Use of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care services for the last pregnancy recorded in the five years preceding the survey, India, 2007&#x02013;08.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0037037-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0037037.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of services received</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of mothers</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The rich were also four times more likely to have had an institutional birth when compared to the poor. The use of PNC was particularly unequal with the rich utilizing these services three times more compared with the poor. The rich-poor ratio in case of babies receiving two or more check-ups within the first 10 days after birth, however, was only 1.8.

The rich were much more likely than the poor to get their babies seen by a health worker within 24 hours of birth.

On the other hand, poor were more likely to receive a newborn check-up in a government facility. The rich were also relatively better in terms of receiving ANC advice than the poor.

Apart from the fact that use of PNC was distinctly lower among home births as against facility births, the poor-rich difference was maintained at almost similar levels. Across all components of PNC and the entire spectrum of wealth score there remained an advantage for use of PNC in case of facility births. The two components i.e. check-up at government facility and private facility depict a pattern conforming to the preference of the rich for private facility. Indeed the socio-economic inequalities in the use of PNC remained high even after adjusting for important socio-economic, demographic and residence related variables. Overall, the predicted probabilities suggest significantly higher use by the rich compared to the poor irrespective of the place of birth of newborn. However, the gap between the richest and poorest was found to be higher in case of facility births compared to home births.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Inequality in PNC by Maternal Complications</title><p>Literature suggests that cesarean births and births with maternal complications are considered to be at high risk during the first few weeks of life. Though low birth weight babies and babies of small size are also at high risk, but they were not included in the analysis due to the unavailability of such information in the DLHS &#x02013; 3 dataset. Therefore, the analysis focusses only on use of PNC among those who had a cesarean birth and those with maternal complications.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037037-g002">Figure 2</xref> presents the use of PNC for cesarean deliveries. For comparison we have contrasted the same against the use of PNC for normal deliveries. Findings clearly suggest higher use of PNC for those who had cesarean deliveries compared to those with normal deliveries. Check-ups for mother and baby within 24 hours of birth were almost universal in the case of cesarean births. On the contrary, such examinations were limited in the case of normal births. However, even in the case of cesarean deliveries not all babies received two-or more check-ups within first 10 days of life. This percentage was even lower in the case of normal deliveries. Another observation relates to babies born from cesarean sections being more likely to get a check-up at a private facility as opposed to normal births examined at government facilites.</p><p>Estimated concentration indices suggest considerable socio-economic inequalities in the use of PNC even for mothers who had cesarean births. This is an important finding given the fact that cesarean sections occur in health facilities and women remain in the facility for a prolonged period of time after the procedure. This should in theory facilitate closer interaction between the mother and the health provider and results in better opportunities to receive appropriate PNC and related counselling services. Though the levels of inequalities were low in three out of five components of PNC, the inequalities were particularly pronounced in choice of place for PNC. The poor were more likely than the rich to access care in a government facility, whereas, the rich tend to utilize private facilities for PNC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037037-t005">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>The adjusted probabilities of accessing PNC by wealth quintile are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037037-t006">Table 6</xref>. The results adjusted for socio-economic, demographic and residence related variables suggest that rich were much more likely than the poor to utilize PNC and that were also more likely to utilize private facility for availing such care.</p><p>Unlike the case of cesarean births, no consistent association was found between maternal complications at the time of birth and subsequent use of PNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037037-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Some of the components had greater use among mothers who did not have complications during birth, while the others were more likely to be used by those mothers with reported complications. Births with maternal complications were no different from normal births in receiving the recommended set of PNC. This finding contradicts our belief that mothers with complications during birth should be using PNC more often than those without complications.</p><p>However, we observe socio-economic inequalities in use of PNC even among mothers who experienced complications during birth. The concentration indices for the first three components were 0.074, 0.236 and 0.109, suggesting significant socio-economic inequality in the use of these three components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037037-t005">Table 5</xref>). Even in case of births with maternal complications, the poor were more likely than the rich to utilize government facilities whereas the rich were more likely to utilize private facilities. The logistic regression results confirm the descriptive findings that the rich availed PNC more than the poor. In some components the differences were of the order of 0.57&#x02013;0.58 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037037-t006">Table 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This research is the first of its kind to present national level analyses of PNC in India. Such an attempt is motivated by the premise of asserting whether inequalities in utilisation of antenatal and childbirth care persist further in PNC as well. The assessment of such inequalities is made across various risk indicators such as cesarean section and births with maternal complications. The findings demonstrate clear evidence that PNC use has been unacceptably low and inequitable in India. The levels of PNC are relatively much lower than those of antenatal and childbirth care. Coverage of PNC is extremely unequal with the richest mothers having better access than their poorer counterparts.</p><p>There is further evidence that effective use of pregnancy and childbirth care in health facilities lead to better PNC <xref rid="pone.0037037-Dilip1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Yet, there are wide socio-economic inequalities in those accessing facility based care. Overall, the coverage of essential PNC is limited especially for mothers from marginalised and economically disadvantaged households. The findings also suggest high inequalities in the type of PNC for births that took place at home compared to facility births &#x02013; with postnatal check-ups within 24 hours and two or more PNC check-ups within the first 10 days of birth being particularly unequal. The risks associated with particularly home births could accumulate due to poor follow-up after the birth. Contrary to our expectations, the use of PNC was also unequitable in the case of facility births, which raises important questions about the functioning and quality of maternal health care services in India. Existing evidence highlight access and cost factors determining antenatal and childbirth care in India including poor transportation, indirect costs and out-of-pocket expenditure associated with care and more importantly poor quality of maternal health care services <xref rid="pone.0037037-Sunil1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037037-Mavlankar1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The present findings are indicative of the fact that part of the non-use and inequalities in maternal health care can be explained by the inherent drawbacks in health systems which are inclined to treat clients based on their socio-economic position. There is, therefore, an urgent need to revamp the maternal health care system in India by one that is efficient in service delivery without any form of discrimination and is also sensitive to the needs of clients.</p><p>Interestingly, the findings indicate socio-economic inequality in postnatal care use even in the case of cesarean births. This is quite surprising given the fact that women are expected to stay longer in facilities after a cesarean section. We did not find any consistent relationship between mothers reporting complications at childbirth and PNC use &#x02013; despite the rich-poor differences. Women who had complications at birth usually need systematic follow-up to monitor and manage health risks for both the mother and her child <xref rid="pone.0037037-Dhakal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The present analyses show that even among this group of women, rich women were particularly more likely than the poor women to seek care during the postnatal period.</p><p>The finding that poor and the marginalized use PNC more from government health facilities is important. Although government facilities minimize the economic burden of healthcare for the poor, the services available are often of sub-standard quality. Postnatal interventions should address the quality of care in government facilities to reduce the inequalities between the rich and the poor.</p><p>The potential limitations of the study should be noted. It has to be noted that maternal complications are self-reported by mothers based on their experiences and perceptions, and hence, the observed relationship between maternal complications and PNC should be interpreted with caution. The present study could not examine the quality of PNC services offered in government/private facilities. Also, there is a lack of information in the DLHS data on whether mothers who had cesarean births had PNC before or after discharge from the facility. Ideally, the questions on postnatal care use in case of cesarean births must refer to PNC use after discharge from the facility. This is because women stay in the facilities for longer periods after cesarean births. Finally, this research could not externally validate the survey responses, although the trends seen in various rounds of DLHS ensure consistency across time. On the other hand, the survey format is standard and regularly used in the various rounds of the DLHS. Survey teams receive formal training and essential quality control measures are in place.</p><p>The findings hold implications for the policies and programmes aimed at improving maternal health in India. One of the important interventions for improving maternal and child health under NRHM has been the conditional cash transfer scheme more widely known as the <italic>Janani Suraksha Yojana</italic> (JSY) <xref rid="pone.0037037-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Under this scheme, pregnant women are offered with cash incentives if they opt to giving a birth in a health facility, public or a government designated private hospital. However, there are no concurrent schemes in place to promote postnatal care.</p><p>Whilst it is important to promote institutional births especially in India where population level risks of maternal and child mortality are very high, essential postnatal care can have additional and substantial benefits in enhancing maternal and child health outcomes and wellbeing at later life <xref rid="pone.0037037-Mavlankar1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Moreover, essential postnatal care could help in reducing postpartum depression among new mothers &#x02013; a topic that has not received adequate attention in the country <xref rid="pone.0037037-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. India urgently needs a comprehensive maternal health package that addresses the spectrum of maternal and extended newborn care &#x02013; both components envisaged critical in achieving the targets 4, 5a and 5b of the UN Millennium Development Goals <xref rid="pone.0037037-Mavalankar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Targeted policy interventions such as health promotion and knowledge campaigns are needed to strengthen the postnatal care component in the maternal health care system.</p><p>In order to have a better understanding of the changes in maternal and child health inequalities there has to be regular monitoring and analysis of health indicators &#x02013; such as postnatal care - and associated inequalities. Further analyses stratified by geographic region of residence and states will offer better policy insights of the heterogeneity of PNC across diverse social and cultural settings. The present study could not incorporate the geographical effects since the analysis explicitly focussed to establish evidence at the national level. Given the socio-economic and geographic diversity in India, large-scale surveys like DLHS should collect more information on postnatal care to allow detailed analysis of postnatal care at the state and regional levels.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This research was conducted as part of the UK Economic &#x00026; Social Research Council (ESRC) Brazil-India Pathfinder Programme for Collaborative Analysis of Microdata Resources.
