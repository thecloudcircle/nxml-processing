critically ill with no specific diagnosis and treatment.
Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is the common
form of delirium observed in septic patients (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It affects the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) function and other brain cells as
a result of dysregulation of cytokines and neurotransmitters
production (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). SAE involves the release of inflammatory
mediators, oxidative stress induction and increase in other
biomarkers that damage brain cells and affect BBB integrity
and intracellular metabolism (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Neuroinflammation,
ischemic processes, and neurotransmitter dysfunction are
processes involved in the pathophysiology of SAE (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
Previous studies reported that microglial and astrocytes
activation affect BBB integrity and stimulate the
production of several mediators in the brain as observed in
SAE (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Inflammation and oxidative stress are crucial
in SAE and can lead to other detrimental effects.</p><p>Metformin was shown to exert its protective role in
sepsis partly through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
properties (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Neuroprotective effects of metformin were
reported to be mediated via these mechanisms. Metformin
prevented brain mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing
oxidative stress levels in high fat diet-induced insulin
resistant rats, promoted neurogenesis and improved
spatial memory, protected against cerebral ischemia,
and enhanced angiogenesis in post-stroke recovery (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Several studies reported the protective effects of
metformin in sepsis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Metformin was shown to inhibit
pro-inflammatory cytokines production, down-regulate
myeloperoxidase expression, and decrease creatine
kinase myocardial band, and brain natriuretic peptide in
endotoxin-induced myocarditis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It protected the lung of septic rats against neutrophil infiltration, inflammation,
and oxidative damage (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Metformin attenuated
sepsis-induced brain injury by inhibiting oxidative
stress and decreasing BBB permeability via activating
phosphatidylinositol-3 Akt signaling pathway (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).
However, the exact mechanism by which metformin exerts
its neuroprotective effects is not clear yet. Elucidation of
other SAE markers and pathways is necessary.</p><p>In this study, the neuroprotective effects of metformin
on SAE were investigated, using cecal ligation and
puncture (CLP) model. We hypothesized that using CLP
model, metformin will improve sepsis severity, restore
BBB function, and attenuate brain injury by reducing
the levels of inflammatory markers, increasing gene
expression of tight junction proteins, and decreasing the
gene expression of brain injury markers which will further
reduce brain structural damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this experimental study, Metformin (&#x0003e;97% purity) was
purchased from (Soha Pharmaceutical Company, Iran).
Ketamine and xylazine used for anesthesia induction,
were purchased from Alfasan, Netherlands, and normal
saline was bought from B-braun, Germany. Formalin,
rat high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) ELISA
and lactate assay kits were obtained from ZellBio GmbH
(Germany). RNase solution, iScript cDNA synthesis kit
and propidium iodide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Germany).</p><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>All protocols and procedures regarding animal handling

VCR.1396.2075. In this experimental study, 36 healthy
adult male Wistar rats (200-250 g) aged 8-10 weeks, were
obtained from the animal facility of Pharmacy, Tehran
University of Medical Sciences (TUMS). All rats were
kept at 25 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C, with 50% humidity and 12-hour day/
night cycle, and had access to standard feed and water
ad libitum. Six (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) rats were randomly assigned to each
group. Group I: Sham (12 hours), group II: CLP (12
hours), group III: CLP+metformin 50 mg/kg (12 hours),
group IV: Sham (24 hours), group V: CLP (24 hours),
and group VI: CLP rats administered metformin 50 mg/
kg (24 hours). Rats were sacrificed after 12 and 24 hours,
depending on the grouping.</p></sec><sec><title>Cecal ligation and puncture model</title><p>CLP was performed to induce sepsis in rats as
previously described (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Rats were anesthetized with
intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine (110/10 mg/kg body
weight). The lower quadrant of the abdomen was shaved
and disinfected and then, a longitudinal skin midline
incision was made. The mesentery of the cecum was
carefully dissected and the cecum was ligated at the designated position for sepsis induction. The cecum was
perforated using 18-gauge needle and two punctures. After
removing the needle, a small amount (droplet) of feces,
was extruded. The cecum was carefully returned into the
abdominal cavity. Prewarmed normal saline (37&#x000b0;C, 5 ml
per 100 g body weight) was administered subcutaneously
to resuscitate the animals and then, the animals were
placed back in cages in a temperature-controlled room
(22&#x000b0;C) with 12-hour light and dark cycles and free access
to water and food. All above procedures were performed
on sham animals except cecum ligation and puncture.</p></sec><sec><title>Murine sepsis score</title><p>This scoring was used to determine disease severity
and mortality as previously described (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The method
has been successfully carried out in rats (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This
scoring system involves specific variables and numbers
that indicate sepsis severity. The score ranged 0 to 4 and
involved appearance, level of consciousness, activity,
response to stimuli, eyes, respiration rate and quality.
Two investigators scored the animals 12 and 24 hours
after sepsis induction where one of the investigators was
blinded to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood and organ sampling</title><p>Blood samples and brains were taken for determination of platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR),
and levels of lactate, high-mobility group box one (HMGB1), genes expression, and
histopathological evaluations. Arterial blood (3 ml) was collected from the left arteria
carotis into plain and heparinized tubes. The samples in the heparinized bottles were kept
for complete blood count analysis while those in plain bottles were centrifuged at 3000 g
for 15 minutes. The plasma was separated, kept in different tubes, and stored at -80&#x002da;C for
further analysis. Brain samples were washed with normal saline and divided into two
hemispheres. The first was stored at -8&#x002da;C for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis, while the second part was stored in 10% formalin for histopathological
studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Platelet lymphocyte ratio determination and lactate
measurement</title><p>PLR determination is used to evaluate inflammatory
responses (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) while lactate is an important marker of
sepsis severity. PLR was determined from the complete
blood count measured using an automated analyzer
(Sysmex, America Inc.). Platelet counts obtained were
divided by lymphocyte counts for each sample to obtain
the platelet/lymphocyte ratio. We measured plasma lactate
concentration using a lactate assay kit (ZellBio GmbH,
Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction
and calculations were done using the standard formula.</p></sec><sec><title>HMGB1 measurement</title><p>HMGB1 is an important marker of late sepsis lethality. It was used to evaluate the effect
of metformin in late sepsis. HMGB1 measurement was performed in the rat&#x02019;s brain that was
stored at -80&#x002da;C The brain sample was homogenized with phosphate buffer and centrifuged.
Specific rat ELISA kit (ZellBio GmbH, Germany) was used according to manufacturer&#x02019;s
protocol and HMGB1 level was calculated using standard curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression evaluation using real-time polymerase
chain reaction</title><p>The expression level of gene of the specific markers for BBB integrity and brain injury
were evaluated (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These included claudins 3 (<italic>Cldn3</italic>), claudin 5
(<italic>Cldn5</italic>), <italic>S100b</italic>, neuron specific enolase
(<italic>Nse</italic>), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (<italic>Gfap</italic>).
Total RNA was extracted from brain samples stored at -80oC using TRIzol&#x000ae; reagent according
to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The genomic DNA was extracted using DNase I, RNase-free
kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, USA). The concentrations of RNA and DNA were determined
by Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000c UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA).
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was then reverse transcribed using the Thermo Scientific
RevertAid First Strand cDNA synthesis kit as per manufacturer&#x02019;s manual. For analysis of
genes expression levels, primer pairs were used with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (<italic>Gapdh</italic>) as the housekeeping gene. Real time RT-PCR, to
determine the expression level of <italic>Cldn3</italic>, <italic>Cldn5</italic>,
<italic>S100b</italic>, <italic>Nse</italic>, and <italic>Gfap</italic>, was performed
on LightCycler&#x000ae; 96 System (Roche) using the SYBR Green master mix. Expression analysis for
each sample was done in triplicates. Cycle number of each reaction was calculated from the
amplification curve to determine the relative gene expression using the comparative cycle
threshold method. The double delta Ct (2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;ct</sup>) analysis was done to determine
the differences in gene expressions among the groups (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The primer sequences used for

on SAE using the CLP sepsis model. The results showed
that CLP significantly increased murine sepsis score, and
induced inflammation enough for disrupting the BBB
and ultimately causing brain injury because of the release
of various inflammatory and brain injury biomarkers.
However, treatment with metformin 50 mg/kg reduced
the inflammation, and improved brain damage, and BBB
function thereby attenuating brain injury.</p><p>Microcirculatory failure, endothelial activation,
BBB disruption, neuroinflammation, and altered brain
signaling are complex mechanisms involved in SAE (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).
Brain signaling is important in detecting the presence of
chemicals released by microorganisms. Circumventricular
organs and the vagus nerve are the pathways involved
in neuroimmune communications where systemic
inflammation is detected via toll-like receptors, CD14, and
cytokine receptors, and visceral inflammation via axonal
cytokine receptors (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Neurotoxic substances such as
nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines,
and glutamate result in cell death within the brain,
which is a consequence of cytokine-induced microglial
activation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukins, and HMGB1
are crucial in endothelial damage, BBB dysfunction,
neuronal damage, and brain cell death (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In sepsis,
microglial and astrocyte activation was linked with the
release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1;
and HMGB1 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The BBB prevents neurotoxic
substances such as cytokines and ROS from reaching the
brain and its breakdown is associated with brain injury
and edema which are common features of SAE (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>The BBB consists of important tight junction proteins
present in endothelial cells that regulate the movement
of substances. In neurological diseases, the concentration
of these proteins is dramatically reduced and this leads
to BBB disruption (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The consequences of BBB
disruption involve the passage of neurotoxic substances
which interact with brain cells and cause brain injury.
Specific proteins in the brain cells such as S100B and
GFAP, are released into plasma or cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) during brain injury (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>CLP model is a gold standard in sepsis research, and it is
resulted from polymicrobial infectious origin and closely
related to human sepsis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, the beneficial
effects of metformin in sepsis may give the researchers
insight on how it may work in humans by inhibiting or
preventing the deleterious responses associated with the
disease.</p><p>Metformin was shown to be protective in sepsis. It was
reported that metformin is effective in different models of
sepsis mainly by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress,
and apoptosis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). HMGB1 is implicated in infectious
diseases during inflammatory response and tissue damage
(<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In sepsis, increased circulating HMGB1 was shown
to be associated with apoptosis and decreased survival rate.
It is released in response to infection as an inflammatory
cytokine and further stimulates an inflammatory response
with subsequent tissue damage (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). HMGB1 was shown
to cause microglial activation and cognitive dysfunction
in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Platelets
accumulation was shown to result in organ failure
through causing excessive inflammation, disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), and microthrombosis in
sepsis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Platelets initiate inflammation by recruiting
neutrophils and other cells to the site of infection or
injury (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This has made platelets important in detecting
inflammation in sepsis. PLR is a new and cheap marker
of inflammatory response (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It has been used to detect
the early onset of sepsis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The inhibitory effects of
metformin on inflammation in lipopolysaccharide-treated
cells and endotoxemia in mice were shown to be induced
by inhibiting the release of HMGB1 a prominent proinflammatory
cytokine and damage associated molecular
pattern (DAMP) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In the present study, we found that
metformin treatment inhibited inflammatory response by
decreasing PLR and HMGB1 levels.</p><p>Hyperlactatemia is an important marker of sepsis
severity and mortality. Decreased lactate clearance during
sepsis was reported as a major cause of hyperlactatemia (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Sepsis is believed to cause lactate accumulation by
affecting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), an enzyme
responsible for the conversion of lactate to pyruvate.
A human study reported significant declines in PDH
during sepsis that was believed to be responsible for
lactate accumulation (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). A distinctive feature of
sepsis is impaired microcirculation with concomitant
increase in lactate level (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In the present study, we
found that in CLP rats, blood lactate levels significantly
increased but reduced by metformin administration.
Since hyperlactatemia in sepsis depicts sepsis severity
and mortality, the decreased MSS scores observed in
metformin-treated groups compared to CLP, may be
an indication of metformin&#x02019;s ability to improve sepsis
outcome. MSS was shown to exhibit high specificity in
predicting sepsis severity and mortality (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, BBB breakdown and brain injury are important features of SAE which occur as a
result of the release of inflammatory mediators and ROS (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Sepsis was shown to
significantly alter the levels of tight junction proteins which are important components of
the BBB (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Agents with antiinflammatory and anti-oxidant properties have been shown
to preserve BBB integrity during sepsis by increasing the concentrations of these proteins
(<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Activation of the microglial and astrocytes associated with cytokine production,
affects the BBB since they help in maintaining its integrity in conjunction with TJ and
transport proteins (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Metformin attenuated brain injury in CLP mice by inhibiting the
inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In our study, the concentration
of PLR and HMGB1 (inflammatory markers) was decreased by metformin administration. The
expression of <italic>Cldn3</italic> and <italic>Cldn5</italic> decreased significantly
after CLP. Metformin treatment improved BBB function as evidenced by the significant
increases in <italic>Cldn3</italic> and <italic>Cldn5</italic> expression.</p><p>In sepsis, BBB impairment results in the passage of neurotoxic substances which can cause
brain injury associated with the release of several markers that damage the astrocytes and
neurons (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The presence of S100B, NSE, and GFAP in the serum indicates a loss in
the BBB integrity as they are almost completely produced in the brain (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). An elevated
level of these proteins is associated with cytokine activation in sepsis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).
S100B, NSE, and GFAP have been used to diagnose sepsis-induced brain injury (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Metformin
through its anti-inflammatory effects, may prevent BBB breakdown and subsequent brain
injury. In the present study, the expressions of <italic>S100b</italic>,
<italic>Nse</italic>, and <italic>Gfap</italic> were significantly increased in CLP groups
which indicated sepsis-induced brain injury. Metformin treatment decreased these expressions
significantly. In this study, obtained results indicated that metformin may improve BBB
function and attenuate brain injury, as evidenced by decreased inflammatory markers,
increased levels of tight junction proteins, and decreased levels of brain injury markers,
and brain damage.</p><p>The histopathological studies revealed the presence of
cerebral hemorrhage, meningitis, and cerebral necrosis
and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the CLP groups,
which were abolished in metformin-treated groups.
The results of histopathological studies confirmed the
inhibitory effects of metformin on inflammatory and brain
injury markers release.</p><p>The correlation data revealed a strong positive correlation between markers of sepsis
severity (MSS and lactate) and inflammatory and brain injury markers but a negative
correlation with <italic>Cldn5</italic>. The effectiveness of metformin administration was
evidenced by its ability to decrease these markers (sepsis severity, inflammatory, and brain
injury) and increase <italic>Cldn3</italic> and <italic>Cldn5</italic> expressions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Metformin improved sepsis severity, and BBB function, and attenuated brain injury by
decreasing sepsis score, lactate levels, inflammatory markers, and expression of brain
injury markers, and increasing the expression of tight junction proteins. This study
provides evidence on the potential therapeutic effects of metformin in SAE. As far as the
