Piezophilic (pressure-loving) organisms are adapted to deep-sea life and grow optimally at pressures higher than 0.1 MPa. To better understand high pressure adaptation from a genomic point of view three different <italic>Photobacterium profundum </italic>strains were compared. Using the sequenced piezophile <italic>P. profundum </italic>strain SS9 as a reference, microarray technology was used to identify the genomic regions missing in two other strains: a pressure adapted strain (named DSJ4) and a pressure-sensitive strain (named 3TCK). Finally, the transcriptome of SS9 grown under different pressure (28 MPa; 45 MPa) and temperature (4&#x000b0;C; 16&#x000b0;C) conditions was analyzed taking into consideration the differentially expressed genes belonging to the flexible gene pool.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>These studies indicated the presence of a large flexible gene pool in SS9 characterized by various horizontally acquired elements. This was verified by extensive analysis of GC content, codon usage and genomic signature of the SS9 genome. 171 open reading frames (ORFs) were found to be specifically absent or highly divergent in the piezosensitive strain, but present in the two piezophilic strains. Among these genes, six were found to also be up-regulated by high pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data provide information on horizontal gene flow in the deep sea, provide additional details of <italic>P. profundum </italic>genome expression patterns and suggest genes which could perform critical functions for abyssal survival, including perhaps high pressure growth.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Piezophilic microbes have been isolated from a variety of abyssal and hadal deep-sea environments and include several psychrophilic or psychrotolerant proteobacteria, and several high temperature Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While the study of these extremophiles is still in its infancy, both physiological and structural adaptations appear to be important for high-pressure life.</p><p>One moderately piezophilic, gamma-proteobacterial isolate, <italic>Photobacterium profundum </italic>strain SS9, has been the subject of a number of studies addressing the nature and regulation of genes important for pressure-sensing and high pressure adaptation, owing to the relative ease of its cultivation as well as its genetic tractability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Here we make use of another important <italic>P. profundum </italic>feature, namely the availability of multiple closely related strains which differ in their pressure and temperature optima. Strain SS9 was isolated from an amphipod in the Sulu Trough at a depth of 2551 m and displays optimum growth at 28 MPa and 15&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>P. profundum </italic>strain DSJ4 was recovered from a sediment sample obtained from the Ryukyu Trench (Japan) at a depth of 5110 m and displays its optimum growth at 10 MPa (with little change in growth at pressures up to 50 MPa) and a temperature optimum of 10&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>P. profundum </italic>strain 3TCK was isolated from a shallow sediment sample obtained from San Diego Bay (California, U. S. A.) and exhibits optimal growth at atmospheric pressure and a broad temperature span for growth from below 0&#x000b0;C to above 20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Recently, the complete genome sequence of strain SS9 was obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This achievement has enabled the scaling up of the study of piezophily and, more generally, of adaptations to the deep sea (i.e., low temperature, low nutrient input, absence of sunlight), at the genomic level. In this study a microarray covering nearly the complete SS9 genome was used to investigate both the flexible gene pool (genes whose presence is variable due to insertion/deletion events) and high pressure adaptation by means of two different post-genomic approaches:</p><p>1-Using the SS9 genome as a reference, comparative genomic hybridization experiments were performed with DNA extracted from the other two <italic>P. profundum </italic>strains (DSJ4 and 3TCK) to identify the flexible gene pool in SS9. To determine if these genes were obtained from lateral gene transfer events or, conversely, from genomic reduction events in the other strains, their GC content, codon usage and genomic signature was analyzed.</p><p>2-Transcriptome analyses were performed as a function of pressure (0.1, 28 and 45 MPa at 16&#x000b0;C) and temperature (4&#x000b0;C vs. 16&#x000b0;C at 0.1 MPa). Although we have recently presented preliminary data on SS9 expression at 0.1 and 28 MPa, in this study temperature effects on gene regulation were compared with pressure effects since increasing pressure exerts some common effects with decreasing temperature in terms of membrane microviscosity and with increasing temperature in terms of protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover the transcriptional changes identified in the 0.1 MPa vs. 28 MPa and 28 MPa vs. 45 MPa experiments were compared in order to reveal expression changes in a piezophilic bacterial species grown at supra-optimal pressure.</p><p>Finally, the results obtained from comparative genomic analyses and expression profiling experiments were combined to identify genes shared among the <italic>P. profundum </italic>piezophiles, absent from the piezosensitive strain, and up-regulated at high pressure. This allowed a few genes to be selected from a pool of approximately 6,000 genes whose distribution and expression characteristics suggest possible function in high pressure adaptation and thus present themselves as candidates for future genetic investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of three <italic>P. profundum </italic>strains</title><p>Amplification and analysis of the 16S rDNA from strain 3TCK revealed that it is 97.7% identical at the 16S level with <italic>Photobacterium profundum </italic>SS9 and 98.7% identical to <italic>P. profundum </italic>DSJ4, suggesting that they are all members of the same species. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree demonstrating the relationship among selected <italic>Photobacterium </italic>species, including the three <italic>P. profundum </italic>strains selected for this study.

This indicates that chr2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) contains a proportionally larger flexible gene pool and that it has been the target of more gene transfer events for its size (~2.2 Mbp) than chr1 (~4.1 Mbp) that contains the most "established" genes.

Genes absent in 3TCK and/or DSJ4 genomes (highlighted in black) are more frequent in horn regions (64% in left horn, 66% in right horn) respect to the middle region (10% of ORFs). The low number of strains analyzed leads to an underestimation of the laterally transferred regions in SS9 and this probably accounts for those genes localized in left and right horn which are present in all three <italic>P. profundum </italic>strains analyzed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-6-122-3"/></fig><p>Taken together these three different analyses were able to identify a large number of potentially laterally transferred regions. For example, a region named Chr1.11 (named for its chromosome location and clockwise order of position, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) has an altered tetranucleotide composition but its GC content is similar to the surrounding regions and it has a "normal" codon bias relative to the average gene versus S3 percentage (data not shown). Conversely, region Chr2.1 is only characterized by a slight GC content variation. The results obtained from these analyses are discussed in-depth below.</p><p>A BLASTP similarity search of SS9 proteins identified various phage-related proteins, mostly encoded in three regions named Chr1.8, Chr2.3 and Chr2.5. Microarray data obtained by comparing the SS9, 3TCK and DSJ4 genomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) confirmed that these genomic portions are absent in both the 3TCK and DSJ4. These regions present characteristics typical of a genomic island (GI): (1) GC content anomalies, (2) altered codon bias, (3) insertion at the 3'-end of a tRNA gene (tRNA-N) and (4) presence of a gene encoding an integrase at one end (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>General characteristics of putative horizontally transferred elements found in the genome of <italic>P. profundum </italic>SS9 strain.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Element</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Absent in strain</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Start-end position</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Size (kbp)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>GC content percent (chr1_42%;

This region is absent only in 3TCK strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the data on variable regions was compared with the transcriptome results to discern if any of the horizontally acquired genes might be indicated to perform a role in pressure or temperature adaptation. The absolute fluorescence value from microarray analysis indicates that the expression levels of most of these genes was quite low. Indeed, only three regions in chr1 (Chr1.13, Chr1.14, Chr1.15) and two in chr2 (Chr2.8, Chr2.9) had fluorescence values higher than the mean fluorescence level of the entire chromosome (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, 11<sup>th </sup>circle).</p><p>Region Chr1.12 is absent in DSJ4 (and in 3TCK this region is smaller) and has three genes, PBPRA2087 (hypothetical protein), PBPRA2084 (putatively evolved beta-D-galactosidase, alpha subunit) and PBPRA2086 (putative oxidoreductase), differentially expressed in pressure experiments.</p><p>Region Chr1.13 is absent in both strains and contains a large gene cluster involved in the tricarboxylic acid fermentation and in the cleavage of citrate to oxaloacetate and acetate.

This indicates that although genes located in these regions could be involved in the high pressure response of SS9, they are not essential to it and other <italic>P. profundum </italic>strains will achieve piezophily with different strategies. Moreover, genes differentially expressed at 28 MPa or 45 MPa, but present in both DSJ4 and 3TCK, could be beneficial but not sufficient for high pressure adaptation.</p><p>Considering only pressure regulated genes belonging to the group absent in 3TCK and/or DSJ4, 29 genes are absent in both strains but only 9 genes are absent in 3TCK strain alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>). These data were obtained using a profile search with JExpress software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Of these 9 genes, 6 are up-regulated at 28 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and/or 45 MPa (PBPRB0026 hypothetical sensor protein TorS; PBPRA0776 hypothetical protein; PBPRA1912 hypothetical protein; PBPRA2251 hypothetical ABC transporter, periplasmic solute-binding protein, family 5; PBPRA2252 hypothetical ABC transporter, permease protein; PBPRA2573 putative long-chain fatty acid transport protein).</p><p>In the SS9 genome we found two genes for TorS proteins (PBPRA1232 and PBPRB0026). Only one of these (named PBPRB0026) is differentially expressed at 28 MPa and this gene is also absent in 3TCK strain. TorS is able to regulate various genes in response to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], in particular it regulates TMAO reductase (PBPRA1467) that is also up-regulated at 28 MPa. It is conceivable that trimethylamine reduction increases the pH of the cytoplasm and, for this reason, other genes identified with microarray experiments, such as tryptophanase (PBPRB0382 and PBPRA2532) increase their expression in order to counter this alcalinization. Alternatively, since no TMAO was added to the SS9 cultures used for the microarray experiments, the second TorS could also be responding to an as yet undiscovered signal.</p><p>In addition to these six genes, others could perform an important role in high pressure adaptation. We expect that a high number of genes and proteins are regulated at the post-transcriptional level and have an important role in high pressure adaptation but these studies are beyond the scope of this paper. Moreover protein structural adaptations, that were not considered in this analysis, could also have great importance for SS9 piezophily.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome analysis of <italic>P. profundum </italic>strain SS9 under different pressure and temperature conditions</title><p>In a previous paper a preliminary analysis was presented for genes differentially expressed at 28 MPa (the optimum growth pressure for SS9) versus 0.1 MPa, highlighting a stress response at low pressure, an heavy involvement of membrane transporters in pressure adaptation and an increased expression at 28 MPa of genes involved in the Stickland reaction and TMAO reduction. Nevertheless, additional transcriptional responses remain to be elucidated including the response to low temperatures and the effect of supraoptimal pressures (45 MPa) on SS9. To better elucidate these points expression profiling was performed at different temperatures (4&#x000b0;C vs. 16&#x000b0;C) and different pressures (28 MPa vs. 45 MPa). To clarify the role of specific biological processes on temperature and pressure adaptation, we also performed a Gene Ontology analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] on differentially expressed genes using specific software such as GoMiner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and FatiGO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of co-regulated genes in pressure and temperature experiments</title><p>The rationale for temperature experiments was the comprehension of which genes are co-regulated during pressure and temperature changes. It is known that low temperature and high pressure have similar effects on some biological structures (for example membranes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We found 36 (43 considering also those that are co-regulated between 45 MPa and temperature) out of 319 genes that share a similar expression pattern between temperature (16&#x000b0;C vs. 4&#x000b0;C) and pressure (0.1 MPa vs. 28 MPa) experiments, a number higher that expected only by chance. In fact, the number of up-regulated genes at 28 MPa and at 4&#x000b0;C is respectively 101 and 75 over 4752 (the total number of genes covered by our array). If the two conditions are independent, the expected number of genes that are up-regulated both at high pressure and low temperature could be estimated as (101/4752)*(75/4752)*4752 = 1.6. Similarly we could estimate the number of down-regulated genes at 28 MPa and 4&#x000b0;C as (108/4752)*(85/4752)*4752 = 1.9. So the total number of genes expected to be up- or down-regulated in both the conditions considered (3.5) is approximately 1/10th of the differentially expressed genes observed. Therefore microarray experiments corroborate the hypothesis that high pressure and low temperature have a overlapping effects on gene expression.</p><p>The SS9 genome sequence reveals the presence of two iron transporters: one (PBPRB0373-PBPRB0375) that is up-regulated at 28 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and at 4&#x000b0;C, while the other one (PBPRA3182, PBPRA3183, PBPRA3184) is up-regulated at 0.1 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and at 16&#x000b0;C. Iron accumulation in organisms that live in the ocean environment is difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and the evolution of two alternative transporters could be important in order to survive under different physical conditions.</p><p>The presence of different isoforms of the same transporter that work at different pressure and temperature conditions is not limited to iron transporters. ORFs PBPRA0098-PBPRA0101 code for a hypothetical oligopeptide transporter and are up-regulated at 0.1 MPa, while ORFs PBPRA2251-PBPRA2254 code for a different oligopeptide transporter that is up-regulated at 28 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and 45 MPa (vs. 28 MPa). Other oligopeptide transporters seem to have the same behaviour such as those codified by PBPRA0521-PBPRA0525 and PBPRA2934-PBPR2938, the first being up-regulated at 28 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and 4&#x000b0;C, while the second is weakly up-regulated at 0.1 MPa.</p><p>There is an entire region (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; region Chr1.13) containing a large number of genes that are up-regulated both at 0.1 MPa and at 16&#x000b0;C. This region was also identified in the above genome comparisons because it is absent in both 3TCK and DSJ4 strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of co-regulated genes in 28 MPa and 45 MPa experiments</title><p>The expression profile of SS9 at 28 MPa (the optimal growth pressure) was also compared with that at 45 MPa.</p><p>Interestingly the 45 MPa vs. 28 MPa expression profile comparison revealed only 68 differentially expressed genes (33 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated), in contrast to the high number of differentially expressed genes between 28 MPa and 0.1 MPa (101 up-regulated and 108 down-regulated). Of these 68 differentially expressed genes, only 31 were specific for very high pressure adaptation, the remaining 37 also being expressed under other environmental conditions tested. This result indicates that SS9 undergoes a heavy reorganization in gene expression between atmospheric pressure and 28 MPa, while this is not seen moving from 28 MPa to 45 MPa.</p><p>A Gene Ontology search with GoMiner software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] indicated that among the 31 genes specific for very high pressure adaptation there is an enrichment of genes involved in arginine metabolism (GO: 0006525), catabolism (GO: 0006527) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">Additional file 5</xref>) and transport (PBPRA2073-PBPRA2076). Experiments at 45 MPa were also useful in identifying genes whose expression follows the direction of pressure variation, being up-regulated or down-regulated both at 28 MPa (compared to 0.1 MPa) and at 45 MPa (compared to 28 MPa). Twenty one genes matched this expression profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>).</p><p>One of these genes encodes a putative delta-9 fatty acid desaturase (PBPRB0742). High pressure increases the rigidity of membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and for this reason genes such as the putative delta-9 fatty acid desaturase presumably were up-regulated in order to increase the membrane unsaturation and thus membrane fluidity. Despite the fact that much is known about membrane modification in response to pressure variation in SS9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], these experiments reveal the possible involvement of a previously unrecognized gene in fatty acid unsaturation. This is particularly noteworthy because fatty acid unsaturation is critical to high pressure growth of SS9.</p><p>A search performed using GoMiner software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] on differentially expressed genes obtained in the 28 MPa vs. 0.1 MPa experiments and in the 28 MPa vs. 45 MPa experiments indicated that transport is one of the main biological processes involved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">Additional file 5</xref>).

As described in the previously published 28 MPa versus 0.1 MPa experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], transport is strongly influenced by pressure, probably due to the effect of pressure on membrane modification and because of the pressure influence on the activation volume &#x00394;V<sup># </sup>(the difference between the transition state volume and the initial volume in the system at equilibrium) of the transport process.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the microbial world genetic material can be transferred between species by several mechanisms involving conjugative plasmids, phages, phage-like elements or transposable elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

In fact, using genomic DNA derived from deep-sea (SS9 and DSJ4) and coastal (3TCK) isolates we were able to identify 28 regions that are absent or highly divergent in DSJ4 and 3TCK strains plus a large number of small regions scattered over the entire SS9 genome.</p><p><italic>In silico </italic>analysis performed on the SS9 genome sequence reveals that some of these regions (for example Chr1.15, Chr2.5, Chr2.7-PI) show differences in GC content, codon usage and genomic signature (see also Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). There are also regions, such as Chr1 1634244&#x02013;1651614 bp (containing the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase, <italic>pfa</italic>, operon), that appear as alien DNA from these analyses, but which are present in all three strains analyzed. While <italic>pfa </italic>mutants are not pressure-sensitive in laboratory culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], it is likely that the <italic>pfa </italic>operon is involved in high pressure adaptation under some deep-sea conditions because omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) do increase in abundance in SS9 membranes with increasing pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and because such fatty acids are known to modify membrane fluidity in response to hydrostatic pressure and temperature.</p><p>These results indicate that bioinformatics and genomic microarray analysis can be merged in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the flexible gene pool in bacteria. Moreover, some of the variable regions identified by microarray analysis but not by bioinformatic analysis could derive from genomic reduction and not from lateral gene transfer.</p><p>On the other hand, when the two separate analyses are in accordance with each other, lateral gene transfer is the most plausible explanation. This is the case for the 80 kbp plasmid. However, the adaptive value of this plasmid to SS9 remains a mystery. It contains no obvious essential genes and can be lost during laboratory cultivation without a detectable phenotypic change.</p><p>A region that is particularly interesting is Chr1.1-LF, consisting mainly of a gene cluster present in SS9 and DSJ4 strains and coding for a second flagellar motility system. It is known that bacterial motility in the sea is a commonly expressed phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This character is important in enhancing bacteria-organic-matter coupling. Moreover, high speed swimming in bacteria may reduce the ability of protozoa to graze on them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Some bacteria, such as <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, posses dual flagellar systems that operate under different circumstances: a polar flagellum allows motility in liquid environments (i.e. swimming), while multiple lateral flagella allow translocation over surfaces or in viscous media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The role of the second motility system in SS9 and DSJ4 motility is currently being investigated.</p><p>The three genomic islands Chr1.8, Chr2.3 and Chr2.5 are likely to be prophages in the <italic>P. profundum </italic>SS9 genome. It has been suggested that prophages might carry genes beneficial for survival of the host in a selective environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In this respect the presence, in these regions, of metabolic genes such as NAD(P)H oxidoreductase (PBPRB0548), a putative TrkA family protein (glutathione-regulated potassium efflux system protein) (PBPRB0550) and tryptophanase (PBPRA1344) might be meaningful. The latter gene has two other paralogues in the SS9 genome one of which (PBPRA2532) is pressure regulated suggesting some role in deep-sea adaptation.</p><p>Recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] we have shown that when moving from 28 MPa to 0.1 MPa, SS9 undergoes various modifications in metabolic processes. At 28 MPa up-regulation of genes involved in the Stickland reaction (an amino acid fermentation process typical of anaerobic bacteria such as <italic>Clostridiales </italic>and <italic>Spirochetales</italic>) and of TMAO reduction occurs.</p><p>Another interesting metabolic modification involves genes of the citrate fermentation pathway located on region Chr1.13. In <italic>Leuconostoc paramesenteroides </italic>the citMCDEFGRP operon, involved in citrate utilization, is located on a plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In SS9 these genes are down-regulated both at 28 MPa and at 4&#x000b0;C, moreover this region is absent both in DSJ4 and 3TCK genomes. The reason for the altered expression of this pathway in SS9 is not clear but pressure could favour some metabolic processes only on the basis of chemical-physical parameters. Some of these genes are absent in 3TCK and DSJ4 and this could reduce the growth rate of these strains at high pressure. In fact reactions accompanied by large volume variation are greatly influenced by pressure, but even if the value of &#x00394;V (the difference between the final and initial volume in entire system at equilibrium, reaction volume) or &#x00394;V<sup># </sup>(apparent volume change of activation or activation volume) is known, it is still difficult to predict how elevated pressure will affect metabolic pathways in living organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], low pressure induces various stress responses reflected by the up-regulation of chaperones (PBPRA0698, PBPRA1023, PBPRA1484, PBPRA3387) and DNA repair enzymes (PBPRA3513, PBPRB0986, PBPRA0694). This stress response is not present at 45 MPa despite being supraoptimal for SS9 growth. Perhaps low pressure affects protein folding because these SS9 proteins are adapted to high pressure and this effect is not evident in high pressure experiments (at least up to 45 MPa). Another curious result stemming from the 45 MPa transcriptome experiment is the apparent reduction in arginine biosynthesis and transport at high pressure relative to that at 28 MPa. It could be that this large amino acid is selected against within much of the protein pool present at this high pressure, in contrast to the thermophilic and piezophilic Archaea <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi </italic>which has a higher arginine content in its proteins respect to the non-piezophilic bacterium <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Alternatively, other genes could govern arginine utilization at high pressure.</p><p>Transport seems to be the cellular process most influenced by pressure, at least considering the number of regulated genes belonging to this category. This influence could be due to volume changes associated with the transport process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Also temperature variation influences the transport process, which could be due to alterations of transporters efficiency induced by membrane fluidity modifications. It is interesting to note that some transporters are present in two or more copies in the SS9 genome and therefore could work at specific pressures and temperatures.</p><p>Likewise, SS9 may choose among different metabolic processes (amino acid reduction, TMAO reduction, citrate fermentation pathway, etc.) as a function of pressure in order to optimize energy gain. Other mechanisms previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], such as the influence of pressure on enzymes involved in complex polysaccharides utilization (PBPRA0480, PBPRA2198, PBPRB1016), support this hypothesis. The ability of SS9 to choose between different transporters or metabolic strategies could also be related to the fact that SS9 is not an obligate and narrow spectrum piezophile, but is able to grow over a large range of pressures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings on genome organization and transcriptional activity of different <italic>P. profundum </italic>strains depict a high level of genetic diversity, where variable regions influence extremely important processes such as motility and energy production. But, due to the complexity of deep-sea environment, characterized by a peculiar combination of chemical-physical parameters and nutrient resources, it is difficult to assign a role to all the variable regions present only in the pressure adapted strains.</p><p>Expression studies on <italic>P. profundum </italic>SS9 performed at different pressure and temperature conditions reveal a complex adaptation network involving a great number of membrane transporters, metabolic processes, and amino acid biosynthesis and membrane modification enzymes.

It was obtained from a superficial sediment sample within San Diego Bay following dilution plating onto a modified K Medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and incubation at 23&#x000b0;C for several weeks. One of the resulting colonies subsequently analyzed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis was determined to be a new strain of <italic>P. profundum</italic>. The 3TCK 16S rDNA was amplified and sequenced using general eubacterial primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] on a MegaBACE 1000 automated sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) according to manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Maintaining bacterial cultures in balanced growth at high pressure, when the cultures are separated from the investigator by ~2 cm of stainless steel, is extremely challenging. Because of these constraints it was not possible for us to serially culture cells under anaerobic, high pressure conditions (at least not without regularly shocking cultures with decompression for several minutes), and thus only one round of culturing was used. Overnight log phase atmospheric pressure cultures of <italic>P. profundum </italic>SS9 cells were grown in Difco Marine 2216 Broth supplemented with 20 mM glucose and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. These cells were diluted 250-fold into the same medium, transferred to polyethylene bulbs, sealed with no air space and placed inside pressure vessels. Cultures were then rocked gently back and forth in a large refrigerated water bath shaker at either atmospheric pressure, at 28 MPa or at 45 MPa. Pressure was applied using a hand operated Haskel pump and a quick fit connector to the pressure vessel. With this system pressurization requires approximately 1 min and decompression ~1 second.</p><p>Under these culture conditions the cells quickly used up most of the available dissolved oxygen, as reflected by resazurin dye reduction analyses. After about 20&#x02013;30 hours the cultures were harvested. In all cases cells were obtained from early log phase cultures (optical density at A600 nm of 0.1&#x02013;0.21). The cells were immediately pelleted and RNA was immediately extracted and stored in 75% ethanol at -80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>For genomic experiments approximately 1 liter of bacterial cells was harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5,000 &#x000d7; g and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml buffer A (50 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The suspension was incubated overnight at -20&#x000b0;C. Then 500 &#x003bc;l of buffer B (250 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mg/ml lysozime) were added to the frozen suspension, which was thawed at room temperature and subsequently incubated on ice for 45 min. At this point 1 ml of buffer C (0.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris, 400 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml Proteinase K) was added and the suspension was incubated at 50&#x000b0;C for 60 min. Additional 750 &#x003bc;l of buffer C were added followed by another 30 min incubation at 50&#x000b0;C. The genomic DNA was extracted twice with 5 ml. of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), and precipitated with 0.8 volumes of isopropanol. The DNA pellet was recovered by spooling on a glass rod, and rehydrated in 4 ml of buffer D (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml RNAse A, pH 8.0) and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

Data obtained from genomic comparison experiments between 3TCK (the pressure sensitive strain) and SS9 strain. In this table are reported ORFs that were found absent only in 3TCK and not in DSJ4 strain. In order to obtain a more reliable result, clones obtained from SAM analysis of 3TCK strain were filtered considering only those having log<sub>2 </sub>ratio higher than +1 and d statistic value higher than +1.8. Using self-written PERL scripts, from the "3TCK clones" set, were subtracted the clones that were found absent also in DSJ4. In DSJ4 strain we used less stringent criteria and we considered all clones having log<sub>2 </sub>ratio higher than 0.5. Clones absent both in 3TCK and DSJ4 were discarded. Clones absent only in 3TCK were associated with ORFs position and the list of ORFs obtained were manually verified. Table columns show: (1) the locus name, (2) the ORF description, (3) the TrEMBL code, (4) the microarray clone/s overlapped to the ORFs, (5) the log<sub>2 </sub>ratio obtain from comparison with SS9 genome (reference), (6) the "d" statistic value obtained from SAM analysis and (7) the result obtained in microarray expression experiments.
