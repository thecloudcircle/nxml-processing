Genetic manipulation for improving triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation represents a promising approach towards the economics of microalgal biofuels. Acetyl-CoA, the essential carbon precursor for <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid biosynthesis, can be derived from pyruvate catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is negatively regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). In the present study, we characterized a <italic>PDK</italic> gene (<italic>NsPDK</italic>) from <italic>Nannochloropsis salina</italic>. Subcellular localization assay assisted by green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion indicated the localization of <italic>NsPDK</italic> in mitochondria of <italic>N. salina</italic> cells. <italic>NsPDK</italic> knockdown via RNA interference strategy attenuated <italic>NsPDK</italic> expression at the mRNA level and its enzymatic activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to faster TAG accumulation without compromising cell growth under high light stress conditions. Interestingly, the TAG increase was accompanied by a decline in membrane polar lipids. <italic>NsPDK</italic> knockdown also altered fatty acid profile in <italic>N. salina</italic>. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis suggested that the carbon metabolic pathways might be influenced by <italic>NsPDK</italic> knockdown leading to diverted carbon flux towards TAG synthesis. Taken together, our results demonstrate the role of <italic>NsPDK</italic> in regulating TAG accumulation and provide valuable insights into future manipulation of oleaginous microalgae for improving biofuel production.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The increasing concerns about the shortage of fossil fuels and the burning-associated environmental problems have led to interest in developing sustainable and renewable biofuels in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Microalgae are considered as a promising feedstock for biofuels, in that they grow fast with high photosynthetic efficiency, have no competition with crops for arable lands, and can accumulate large quantities of triacylglycerols (TAGs), an ideal precursor for making biodiesel via transesterification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although many advances have been achieved for microalgal biofuels, challenges remain to be addressed to bring down the production cost for commercial uses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Efforts are being made to improve lipids, TAGs in particular, by rational genetic engineering based on the understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">TAG biosynthesis is believed to be mediated mainly via two pathways, acyl-CoA independent pathway and acyl-CoA dependent Kennedy pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The latter pathway contributes largely to the TAG accumulation under abiotic stress conditions, which starts from glyceol-3-phosphate with three sequential acylation steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The acyls in TAG can be either from recycled membrane lipids or from <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized fatty acids (FAs), both with the primary precursor being acetyl-CoA. Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> found out that most of the genes involved in <italic>de novo</italic> FA synthesis were downregulated while total fatty acid accumulation was significantly enhanced in <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> under nitrogen starvation. This could explain why previous attempts to increase lipid content by overexpressing acetyl-coA carboxylase or fatty acid synthase had limited success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. It has been speculated that provision of acetyl-CoA may be the rate-limiting step for TAG biosynthesis in <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic>. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) is a multienzyme complex catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to yield acetyl-CoA and NAD(P)H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. PDHC contains three primary components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). Higher plants contain two distinct isoforms of PDHC, one located in mitochondria and the other in the plastid stroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial PDHC becomes inactive once Ser-phosphorylation occurs in the &#x003b1;-subunit of PDHC E1 component, which is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The characterization of PDK has been conducted in some higher plants as well as microalgae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Overexpression of a <italic>PDK</italic> gene from <italic>Brassica napus</italic> in Arabidopsis resulted in a decrease in both the PDHC activity and seed oil content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>PDK</italic> knockdown, on the other hand, made Arabidopsis accumulate elevated oil levels in seeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Recently, it was reported that the antisense knockdown of <italic>PDK</italic> promoted neutral lipid accumulation in the diatom <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>, but with compromised cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Besides, only neutral lipids were analyzed based on Nile red staining in this study; the effects of <italic>PDK</italic> knockdown on TAG and polar lipids content remained unknown.</p><p id="Par4">
<italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> has been emerging as an oleaginous model alga to study TAG biosynthesis and regulation because of its fast growth, high TAG content, available genome sequence, and established genetic tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. <italic>Nannochloropsis salina</italic> has been reported to be successfully transformed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Here we report the characterization of a <italic>PDK</italic> gene (<italic>NsPDK</italic>) from <italic>Nannochloropsis salina</italic>. Assisted with the enhanced green fluorescence protein fusion, NsPDK was found to be positioned likely in mitochondria. <italic>NsPDK</italic> knockdown via RNA interference strategy not only promoted total lipid content and altered fatty acid profiles, but also enhanced TAG accumulation, while without slowing down cell growth. Transcriptional analysis suggested the possible gene regulatory network of PDK and its knockdown may bring more carbon precursors and reducing powers for <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis thereby enhancing TAG accumulation.

For example, the lipid accumulation was enhanced in Kd1-4 and Kd1-9 on day 2 (by 21.6 and 30.1%, respectively) as compared to the control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Accordingly, the total fatty acid (TFA) synthesis was significantly enhanced in Kd1-9 during the first two days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b and c</xref>).

The injection temperature, ion temperature and interface temperature were set at 250&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 260&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively. The initial column temperature was set at 150&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The column temperature subsequently rose to 200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/min and then to 250&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/min, followed by a hold at 250&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;min. FAMEs were identified using the NIST 11 mass spectral library (NIST/EPA/NIH mass spectral library, 2011 edition).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par33">All data were obtained by using at least three biological samples to ensure the reproducibility of the results.
