Immunotherapy may generate specific anti-tumor immune responses, and dendritic cells (DC), professional antigen-presenting cells, are widely used in experimental cancer immunotherapy. Several reports describe methods for the generation of mature, antigen-pulsed DC for clinical use. Improved quality and standardization are desirable to obtain GMP-compliant protocols. In this study we describe the generation of DC from 31 Glioblastoma (GB) patients starting from their monocytes isolated by immunomagnetic CD14 selection using the CliniMACS&#x000ae; device. Upon differentiation of CD14+ with IL-4 and GM-CSF, DC were induced to maturation with TNF-&#x003b1;, PGE<sub>2</sub>, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6. Whole tumor lysate was obtained, for the first time, in a closed system using the semi-automated dissociator GentleMACS&#x000ae;. The yield of proteins improved by 130% compared to the manual dissociation method. Interestingly the Mean Fluorescence Intensity for CD83 increased significantly in DC pulsed with &#x0201c;new method&#x0201d; lysate compared to DC pulsed with &#x0201c;classical method&#x0201d; lysate. Our results indicate that immunomagnetic isolation of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes using the CliniMACS&#x000ae; device and their pulsing with whole tumor lysate proteins is a suitable method for clinical-scale generation of high quality, functional DC under GMP-grade conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Health, by Regione Lombardia and by a grant from &#x0201c;il Fondo di Gio&#x0201d;, a charity affiliated to the International Brain Tumor Alliance.

In our study we introduced three innovative changes in methods for DC preparation: i) processing of the tumor performed with an automated, closed system; ii) DC differentiation, loading and maturation were done in teflon bags; iii) cryopreservation of loaded and matured DC seven days after immunoselection.</p><p>Heterogeneity in Tumor Assocciated Antigens (TAA) expression in GB represents the main reason to use whole-tumor lysates as a source of TAA for DC loading. As opposed to synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins, whole cell preparations, such as tumor cell lysate, contain the unaltered spectrum of known as well as unknown tumor antigens that are unique to the patient&#x02019;s tumor <xref rid="pone.0052301-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Our methods to generate tumor lysates are designed to conserve both lipid-soluble and water-soluble molecules as tumor lysis takes place in 0.9% NaCl without detergents.

Here, we propose an improved and standardized protein-extraction procedure, which led to an increased protein yield.</p><p>As a further confirmation of the improvement provide by the semi-automated method of tumor lysis, we observed a significant increase in CD83 expression on DC activated with the tumor lysate produced following the &#x0201c;new method&#x0201d; rather than the &#x0201c;classical method&#x0201d; tumor lysate.</p><p>Moreover flow cytometry analysis performed on DC induced to maturation with cytokine cocktail in the absence of tumor lysate indicates that expression levels of CD83 on mature-non activated-DC (data not shown) are as homogeneus as observed on &#x0201c;new method&#x0201d; lysate activated DC. This result seems to indicate that the non-homogeneous lysates obtained via the old &#x0201c;classical method&#x0201d; reflected in the non-homogeneous expression of CD83. All these drawbacks were overcome by the use of the GentleMACs device.</p><p>The state of complete DC activation is known to correlate with high expression of CD83, presently the most specific marker for mature DC.
