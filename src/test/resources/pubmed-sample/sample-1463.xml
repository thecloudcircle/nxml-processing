Rejection in these young patients occurs even in the absence of known immunological risk factors.

To analyze this, NK cells were depleted in baby rats before keratoplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Allogeneic keratoplasty was performed between Lewis and Fisher rats. The recipient's ages were 10 and 3 weeks, respectively. NK cells were depleted by an intraperitoneal injection of a monoclonal antibody. All experiments were controlled by the injection of isotypic control antibodies and syngeneically. Survival rates were calculated and cellular infiltrates were analyzed histologically.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>NK cell depletion did delay median graft survival times in a statistically significantly way compared with the control animals (p&#x0003c;0.01).

In humans in low-risk situations, allograft survival rates are more than 90%. The survival rate decreases dramatically if other issues exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>], such as ocular surface inflammation (e.g., infection, chemical burn, re-transplantation) or immune-mediated disease (e.g., allergies, rheumatologic disorders). In these high-risk patients, corneal allograft survival is reduced to 30%. A third group of patients includes young children (&#x0003c;3 years of age) where graft survival occurs in only 15%&#x02013;35%, despite the absence of local or systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Taking into consideration that the risk of rejection in solid organ transplantation in children (e.g., kidney) is not increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], this clinical observation following keratoplasty is surprising. The importance of a high success rate following infant keratoplasty is emphasized by the fact that any form of uncorrected corneal opacity in infancy leads to amblyopia. To develop effective treatment strategies that promote graft survival following infant keratoplasty and prevent the development of amblyopia, it is of intrinsic interest to understand the mechanisms of the rejection process in an infant&#x02019;s eye.</p><p>To study the immune mechanisms of corneal transplant rejection, animal models are widely used. In rodent keratoplasty, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to be key elements during immunological graft failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Also other immune factors as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages or natural killer (NK) cells have been shown to contribute to some extent to graft failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Hori et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] showed for the first time that the corneal epithelium plays a major role and hypothesized that it acts during the process of sensitizing the immune system toward a response. The contribution of epithelium-born antigens during the priming process was additionally proven by Saban et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. A substantial amount of corneal corneal antigen presenting cells (APC) is located within the epithelial layer, which might explain these findings. In the context of high-risk keratoplasty, preformed corneal vessels and an elevated number of corneal APC are linked to promoting a faster presentation of antigen and a faster stimulation of the alloresponse against a corneal graft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, an allograft rejection is a multi-factorial scenario mediated by systemic and local immune factors. Moreover, its different components can compensate for each other to a certain extent. Even if a corneal allograft faces this complex system, the majority of transplants are accepted in adult humans. In short, the survival of a transplanted cornea can be traced back to the immune status of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. This exceptional position in the immune system is, to a certain extent, not applicable in high-risk keratoplasty. However, little is understood about mechanisms of the ocular immune privilege in young individuals. The clinically increased rejection rate of a corneal allograft in young children suggests differences in the protective ocular immune situation: In this context changes in juvenile immune privilege, e.g., functionally different ocular APC or alterations in the components of the aqueous humor might play a role.</p><p>To analyze changes of the ocular immune privilege or related immune mechanisms in infants and their impact during infant keratoplasty, we recently introduced a baby rat model for corneal transplantation that resembles the situation in young humans: Without additional immunological differences or risk factors, young recipients of a corneal allograft show a significantly earlier rejection compared with old rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. We confirmed a dominating infiltration of NK cells at all stages of the rejection period that even outlasted the actual rejection time point for grafts in young recipient animals compared with old rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. During infancy, NK cells are a part of the innate immune system and can compensate, to a certain extent, for the missing T cell repertoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Our hypothesis that NK cells contribute to the process of immunological graft failure following keratoplasty in young recipient rats is therefore likely and was analyzed by depletion experiments with the baby rat model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and anesthesia</title><p>Inbred female Fisher (Rt1<sup>lv1</sup>) and Lewis (Rt1<sup>l</sup>) rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were used as donors and recipients.

Because any form of uncorrected corneal opacity leads to the development of life-long amblyopia in these children, it is of great clinical interest to improve corneal graft survival in children. Recently, we introduced the baby rat model for keratoplasty that allows us to study the underlying mechanisms experimentally. Analogous to humans, young rats rejected a corneal allograft significantly earlier than did old animals. Histological analysis demonstrated a stronger infiltration of NK cells in the young rats compared with the old recipient rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that NK cells contribute to immunological graft failure following keratoplasty in infants.</p><p>To analyze this hypothesis, NK cells were depleted in young Lewis rats before keratoplasty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The systemic absence of NK cells was proven by flow cytometry of blood and lymphoid organs as well as histologically in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, no negative side effects in the T cell pool were observed, excluding that the key player for corneal graft rejection in old recipients (i.e., T cells) would also be affected. NK cell depletion lead to a significant delay of the median rejection time point compared with control-treated animals (day 11 versus day 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). This finding demonstrated that NK cells did contribute to corneal graft rejection in young rats, whereas their influence on graft rejection in old recipients seemed to be negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). From mice, it is known that a missing component of their immune system is replaceable by other factors, such as macrophages, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or complementary factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Depending on the conditions at the time of transplantation (i.e., low risk, high risk, type of model used, etc.), the composition of the various immune factors is variable and some components can compensate for others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. However, the different immune mediators can reach a critical limit that leads to rejection in diverse pathways whereby rejection kinetic is affected. A similar event seems to happen in our model and will be discussed later.</p><p>To understand compensatory mechanisms at the graft side that finally cause graft rejection in young rats in more detail, we did histological analysis of rejected grafts and compared them to the total cellular infiltration. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, the total amount of CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes did not vary between both allogeneic groups. This finding underlines our hypothesis that the immune system is compensating for a missing component. It clearly demonstrates that a critical amount of cellular infiltration is required and is sufficient to achieve graft rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. NK cell depletion delays the time point when the critical and compensatory immunological cell infiltration is reached without preventing rejection.</p><p>We analyzed specific leukocyte populations within this immune infiltration to get more insight into the actual compensatory mechanisms that still have the capacity to reject the corneal graft. NK cell depletion led to an increase of graft infiltrating CD25<sup>+</sup> cells, pointing to a contribution of T cells in the rejection process of treated rats. Only a slight increase of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in NK-cell-depleted recipients was observed, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrated to a significantly greater extent (p&#x0003c;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that CD4<sup>+</sup> rather than CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the immune reaction to the graft in NK-cell-deficient recipients. However, it remains unclear whether the infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are allo-protective or allo-reactive as there are CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cell subpopulations with different effector mechanisms: On the one hand, regulatory T cells (Treg) with inhibitory functions express CD4 and CD25. A role for these Treg was proposed in pediatric liver transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>] and has just recently been suggested in the mouse keratoplasty model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Their contribution to a prolonged allograft survival following infant keratoplasty would therefore also be possible.</p><p>On the other hand, effector T cells also express CD4 and CD25. Their important role during corneal allograft rejection in adults is indisputable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] and therefore is also likely in the baby rat model. It would be necessary to deplete CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells alone or in combination with NK cells to understand their general contribution to corneal allograft rejection in infants. To distinguish between activated and regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the expression of the transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) that is mainly active in Treg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] could be analyzed by rtPCR or by flow cytometry within infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The role of CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes populations is likely in our model; however, their function in the rejection process remains unclear.</p><p>Looking at infiltrating macrophages as another main arm of the innate immune system that has a stronger influence in the early times of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>] revealed a significant increase of CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages in grafts of NK-cell-deficient recipients (p&#x0003c;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Because macrophages have been shown to affect immunological graft failure after keratoplasty in mature mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], we would suggest that they could also compensate for NK cell deficiency in infants and promote rejection. However, only depletion of macrophages alone by clodronate liposomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] or together with NK cell depletion would explain their role during allograft rejection in young recipients.</p><p>Finally and aside from the analysis of the infiltrate of leukocytes, it has to be taken into consideration that the depleting antibody used is directed against CD161 expressed by NK and NKT cells. NKT cells are known to contribute to the development of anterior chamber induced immune deviation (ACAID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], which is one mechanism of the ocular immune privilege that otherwise promotes the good survival rates of a corneal allograft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. In our experimental setting, both CD161<sup>+</sup> cell populations are eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, 3.2.3-treatments could have different effects that would explain the delayed rejection: Initially, the aggressive NK cell response to an allograft in young rats would be weakened and rejection would not occur as fast as in control animals. At the same time, ACAID-promoting NKT cells would also be erased. Thereby, one mechanism of the ocular immune privilege that would otherwise promote graft survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>] would be weakened as a side effect. This would explain that rejection would only be delayed but could still occur in all young recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). To exclude that NK and NKT cells act in this antagonistic way during the process of corneal graft rejection in young recipients, it would be necessary to selectively deplete every single cell population. Moreover, the effect of the treatment with 3.2.3 on the ability to develop ACAID could be analyzed in this model.</p><p>Considering these data together, we demonstrated that NK cells contribute to allograft rejection after keratoplasty in young rats. However they are obviously not solely responsible because NK-cell-deficient young recipients still reject a corneal allograft at a rate of 100%. Our results suggest that the rejection of a corneal allograft in young recipients is a multi-factorial process that involves NK cells and macrophages as parts of the innate immunity, as well as T cells of the developing adaptive immune response. Weakening one mechanism, here by the depletion of NK cells, seems to strengthen another one, e.g., macrophages and/or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Bernhard Vanhove for providing the 3.2.3 hybridoma cells for NK cell depletion, Sabrina Schwartzkopff for her helpful discussions and Linda Sipp and her team for excellent animal husbandry.
