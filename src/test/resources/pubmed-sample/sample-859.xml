Knowledge exchange provides an opportunity to reduce this gap; however, there has been limited evaluation of these initiatives. This research explored researchers&#x02019; and knowledge users&#x02019; perceptions of outcomes associated with a knowledge exchange initiative within COMPASS, a longitudinal study of Canadian secondary students and schools. Schools received annual tailored summaries of their students&#x02019; health behaviours and suggestions for action and were linked with knowledge brokers to support them in taking action to improve student health.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with COMPASS researchers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13), school staff (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13), and public health stakeholders (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) to explore their experiences with COMPASS knowledge exchange. Key issues included how knowledge users used school-specific findings, perceived outcomes of knowledge exchange, and suggestions for change.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Outcomes for both knowledge users and researchers were identified; interestingly, knowledge users attributed more outcomes to using school-specific findings than knowledge brokering. School and public health participants indicated school-specific findings informed their programming and planning. Importantly, knowledge exchange provided a platform for partnerships between researchers, schools, and public health units. Knowledge brokering allowed researchers to gain feedback from knowledge users to enhance the study and a better understanding of the school environment. Interestingly, COMPASS knowledge exchange outcomes aligned with Samdal and Rowling&#x02019;s eight theory-driven implementation components for health-promoting schools. Hence, knowledge exchange may provide a mechanism to help schools implement a health-promoting schools approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This research contributes to the limited literature regarding outcomes of knowledge brokering in public health and knowledge exchange in school health research. However, since not all schools engaged in knowledge brokering, and not all schools that engaged discussed these outcomes, further research is needed to determine the amount of engagement required for change and examine the process of COMPASS knowledge brokering to consider how to increase school engagement.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>School health</kwd><kwd>Knowledge translation</kwd><kwd>Knowledge exchange</kwd><kwd>Knowledge brokering</kwd><kwd>Qualitative research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000035</institution-id><institution>Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OOP-110788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leatherdale</surname><given-names>Scott T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000036</institution-id><institution>Institute of Population and Public Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-114875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leatherdale</surname><given-names>Scott T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">The World Health Organization defines a health-promoting school as &#x0201c;a school constantly strengthening its capacity as a healthy setting for living, learning and working&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], p. 2). A health-promoting schools approach, also referred to as Comprehensive School Health (Canada) and Coordinated School Health (United States) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], is a whole-school approach that promotes health in school environments, through policy and community partnerships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the potential population-level impact of a health-promoting schools approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], schools face challenges regarding implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To enhance implementation, Samdal and Rowling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] outlined eight theory-driven implementation components for health-promoting schools. <italic>Preparing and planning for school development</italic> describes tasks required before implementation, including identifying policies and practices to anchor the approach within the school, and establishing a team to lead implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. <italic>Policy and institutional anchoring</italic> involves integrating action items to target student health in school documents (e.g., school strategic plan). Both <italic>professional development</italic> (e.g., formal training organized by the school board) and <italic>professional learning</italic> (e.g., daily practices directed by school needs) are necessary to build staff capacity for adopting the health-promoting schools approach. Next, <italic>leadership</italic> (motivation) and <italic>management</italic> (logistics that allow for change) are required for organizational change and must be integrated using both <italic>relational</italic> (interpersonal) and <italic>organizational</italic> (e.g., funding and resources) <italic>support</italic>. <italic>Student participation</italic> and <italic>partnerships</italic> between schools and health practitioners are also critical. Lastly, in order to ensure <italic>sustainability</italic>, monitoring, evaluation, and continued resource allocation are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">A key implementation challenge is that while the health-promoting schools approach prioritizes health, schools prioritize education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which leads to poor implementation fidelity of the health-promoting schools approach. These competing priorities align with Graham&#x02019;s knowledge to action gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which depicts a misalignment of research and practice. Knowledge exchange, in which researchers and knowledge users collaboratively disseminate and apply research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], provides an opportunity to reduce this gap. The term knowledge user describes individuals who are &#x0201c;likely to use research results to make informed decisions about health policies, programs, and/or practices&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (p. 1). Knowledge brokering is a type of knowledge exchange, in which individuals act as a link between researchers and knowledge users to support the use of research evidence in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite an emphasis on knowledge translation in public health research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], evaluation of these initiatives and their outcomes are still emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The need for evaluation of these strategies in school health research has also been recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The Cohort Study on Obesity, Marijuana-use, Physical activity, Alcohol-use, Smoking, and Sedentary Behaviour (COMPASS) is an ongoing longitudinal study (2012&#x02013;2021) of student health behaviours and secondary school environments in Ontario and Alberta, Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Each year, students report several health behaviours in a survey, administrators report school-level policies and programs through a questionnaire, and researchers record observations of the school&#x02019;s built environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition to traditional dissemination mechanisms (e.g., publications and presentations), two knowledge exchange strategies were integrated during the first phase (2012&#x02013;2016) to support school prevention efforts to enhance student health. Each year, schools received a School Health Profile (SHP), a tailored summary of their students&#x02019; health behaviours based on survey data, including evidence-based recommendations to address student outcomes and contact information for their local public health unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Each school was assigned a knowledge broker, who discussed the school&#x02019;s summary and provided ongoing support as needed (e.g., identifying health priorities within the school and connecting school personnel to community agencies). While a knowledge broker contacted each school annually, the schools decided whether they engaged in knowledge brokering. Further information regarding COMPASS knowledge brokering procedures can be found online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The first phase of COMPASS (2012&#x02013;2016) consisted of 91 schools (n<sub>Y1</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;43, n<sub>Y2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;89, n<sub>Y3</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;87, n<sub>Y4</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;81).

Factors that influenced COMPASS knowledge exchange (including facilitators and challenges to knowledge brokering practice and engagement) have been examined previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This paper expands upon a quantitative analysis of knowledge brokering outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], by exploring researchers&#x02019; and knowledge users&#x02019; experiences with COMPASS knowledge exchange activities, with particular focus on perceived outcomes and suggestions for change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par15">Qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with researchers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13), school staff (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13), and public health stakeholders (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) between January and October 2016, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interview guides (see Additional Files) were similar for each participant group, while also capturing role differences. For example, all participants were asked about outcomes associated with knowledge user engagement in COMPASS knowledge exchange, but researchers were also prompted regarding whether there were outcomes for the research team. The COMPASS Principal Investigator notified all members of the core COMPASS team (knowledge brokers and Project Manager) and all Co-Investigators (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) that they would be invited to participate in an interview by the first author. The first author then emailed invitations to participate.</p><p id="Par16">Our school interview participants were a subset of the COMPASS (2012&#x02013;2016) sample. We purposefully sampled schools engaged in knowledge brokering to varying degrees. From the COMPASS (2012&#x02013;2016) sample, we identified four Ontario school boards that had at least one &#x0201c;involved&#x0201d; school (in-person meeting and/or more than one phone call with knowledge broker annually) and a mix of &#x0201c;somewhat involved&#x0201d; (one phone call annually) and &#x0201c;not involved&#x0201d; schools. Each of these boards had 4&#x02013;6 schools participating in COMPASS. After gaining approval from respective school boards, we invited staff from 19 COMPASS schools for an interview via email; each school received a $30 honorarium per participant. Staff from three public health units involved in COMPASS knowledge brokering were also invited to participate via email.</p><p id="Par17">All participants were provided with a letter of information detailing the research objectives and methods prior to providing consent to participate. Researchers were interviewed in person at the university (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) or by phone (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), while public health and school stakeholders were interviewed by phone. All interviews were conducted by the first author, a female doctoral candidate trained and experienced in qualitative methods. Interviews ranged from 20 to 90&#x000a0;min in duration. Eight members of the core COMPASS team (all six knowledge brokers, Principal Investigator, Project Manager) and five Co-Investigators (eight females, five males) participated, representing three Canadian universities. Six teachers, five principals, and two vice-principals (eight males, five females) from nine schools in four Ontario school boards participated. Six schools were involved in knowledge brokering, two schools were somewhat involved, and one school was not involved. Eight of thirteen school participants had engaged in knowledge brokering. The public health participants consisted of two nurses working in schools and two coordinators overseeing school initiatives within public health units. All public health participants had received SHPs for their corresponding school(s) and three had engaged in knowledge brokering. One of the public health units worked with two schools in the sample.</p><p id="Par18">Interviews were audio-recorded with permission and transcribed verbatim for subsequent thematic content analysis using NVivo for Mac 11 (QSR International). Field notes were also made during the interview and used to contextualize the analysis. A template organizing style was used to code the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; for each participant group, the first author read all of the transcripts to determine thematic codes (arising deductively and inductively) to compose a coding manual. The coding manuals for each participant group were used to code the respective transcripts and identify relevant data. Inter-rater reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and peer examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] were employed to enhance qualitative rigour of the findings. For each participant group, a second researcher coded two transcripts and the researchers&#x02019; coding of the same transcript was compared. For the knowledge broker, Co-Investigator, school, and public health transcripts, coding agreement (whether the same codes were applied to a section of text) was calculated using the methods described by Miles and Huberman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; agreement for all groups was greater than 70% and deemed acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

</p><p id="Par78">Researchers attributed knowledge brokering as one of the reasons COMPASS had a low school attrition rate, with only 10 of 90 schools leaving the study over four years:</p><p id="Par79">
<disp-quote><p id="Par80"><italic>&#x0201c;One of the reasons schools aren&#x02019;t dropping out is that they&#x02019;re recognizing that we&#x02019;re really trying to do things to help advance their agenda. Answering our own research questions obviously, but also advancing their agenda. The knowledge brokers have played a big role in that. We have had some schools who&#x02019;ve debated, because of competing priorities, leaving the study, and it&#x02019;s often the knowledge broker interacting with them where they recognize it&#x02019;s worthwhile staying in.&#x0201d; </italic>(PI)</p></disp-quote>

And all of a sudden, you know, you can start networking, maybe help that school connect with this school, because they said &#x02018;ok I want to contact that person and find out what they did and how that was organized.&#x02019;&#x0201d;</italic> (Teacher, S4).</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par87">Despite the inclusion of provincial and national averages for health outcomes in the SHP, schools specifically wanted to know how their school compared to other COMPASS schools:<disp-quote><p id="Par88"><italic>&#x0201c;Comparisons I think are important because, like I see it in some of the [findings], but I think it gives you a frame of reference.

<disp-quote><p id="Par92"><italic>&#x0201c;So I think if people that are using [the SHP] know that they can call and get more information.

These qualitative results indicate the value in providing school-specific findings to participants in school health research (especially in longitudinal studies), and illustrate how the findings were used, providing a deeper understanding of the breadth of outcomes from both researcher and knowledge user perspectives. Similar to the factors influencing COMPASS knowledge exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], knowledge users focused on outcomes related to their use of COMPASS findings, while researchers focused on outcomes of knowledge brokering.

However, previous research suggests that determining optimal knowledge translation methods is context-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; hence, individual schools may benefit from different knowledge exchange strategies, one of which is knowledge brokering.

In addition to the value of COMPASS findings for schools, public health units gained a sense of adolescent health behaviours in their regions, which informed their programming and planning. Importantly, knowledge exchange provided a platform for partnerships between researchers, schools, and public health units. Knowledge brokering allowed researchers to gain feedback from knowledge users to enhance the study, and a better understanding of the school environment, consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For example, feedback from schools led COMPASS researchers to apply for, and receive, funding to develop a COMPASS Mental Health Module (PJT-149092). As well, knowledge brokering contributed to the retention of participating schools throughout the four-year study. However, Co-Investigators mentioned few outcomes of COMPASS knowledge exchange, as the majority were not involved with these components; considerations for the role of Co-Investigators in COMPASS knowledge exchange will be explored in future research.</p><p id="Par100">Interestingly, COMPASS knowledge exchange outcomes align with factors influencing the implementation of a health-promoting schools approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> illustrates how COMPASS knowledge exchange activities led to achievement in each of Samdal and Rowling&#x02019;s eight theory-driven implementation components for health-promoting schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and incorporates opportunities to further improve the implementation of these components in the study&#x02019;s next phase (2017&#x02013;2021). COMPASS provides key baseline data that allow schools to assess their students&#x02019; health status, identify priorities, create action items, and establish an individual or team to lead school action. Achieving the first implementation component can be enhanced by including means for all schools in the COMPASS sample (to allow individual schools to assess how their students&#x02019; health behaviours compare) and examples of activities from other schools. Schools were able to incorporate COMPASS findings into their School Improvement Plans to identify student health priorities, integrating them with other (academic) priorities. This is a fundamental strategy for health-promoting schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Alignment of COMPASS knowledge exchange outcomes with Samdal and Rowling&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] implementation components of health-promoting schools</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Implementation component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</th><th>Corresponding COMPASS knowledge exchange outcome</th><th>Opportunities for COMPASS knowledge exchange (next phase)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Preparing and planning for school development</td><td>Receiving school-specific findings and communicating with knowledge brokers allowed schools to:<break/>-have baseline data of student health behaviours<break/>-identify priorities related to student health (and action items)<break/>-integrate student health as a priority in their School Improvement Plans, create specific action items<break/>-establish a school contact for the COMPASS study and a School Health Committee</td><td>&#x02022;

However, opportunities to further develop these partnerships were identified: i) COMPASS schools could form a community of practice to share ideas for addressing similar student health behaviours, ii) increase in-person knowledge brokering meetings to strengthen partnerships, and iii) increase understanding of the knowledge broker role so schools recognize that researcher support is available. Developing a community of practice for COMPASS schools would allow for knowledge transfer between knowledge users, aligning with current educator practices of sharing resources and ideas informally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Based on this recommendation, the COMPASS team is beginning to establish this network. While the timeframe of this research did not allow for assessing outcomes after the first four years of COMPASS, potential indicators of <italic>sustainability</italic> include knowledge users continuing to incorporate student health in their School Improvement Plans, making changes to improve student health, and participating in the next phase of COMPASS. Additionally, evaluating the link between school-level changes and academic outcomes would increase school buy-in for adopting a health-promoting schools approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par103">The alignment of COMPASS knowledge exchange outcomes with Samdal and Rowling&#x02019;s implementation components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] suggests that knowledge exchange in longitudinal studies may provide a mechanism for schools to implement a health-promoting schools approach. However, not all schools engaged in knowledge brokering (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]), and not all schools that engaged discussed knowledge brokering outcomes, or even remembered participating in knowledge brokering. Five schools that participated in knowledge brokering did not discuss knowledge brokering outcomes; in some cases (but not all), this may be because the participant was not the main school contact who participated in knowledge brokering (i.e., the main COMPASS contact had changed over the course of the study). While all schools in the sample discussed outcomes that aligned with Samdal and Rowling&#x02019;s components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (e.g., outcomes of using COMPASS findings), only a few achieved all components.</p><p id="Par104">Further, a question arises regarding the level of knowledge exchange engagement required to achieve these implementation components. While all schools in the sample used COMPASS findings and discussed perceived outcomes of using them, more outcomes were discussed by involved schools compared to somewhat and not involved schools. This suggests our categorization of knowledge brokering engagement was meaningful; however, we found school-level outcomes for both somewhat involved and involved schools in the quantitative analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], indicating further research is needed to determine the amount of engagement required for change.</p><p id="Par105">Further research could investigate alternative knowledge exchange approaches to engage schools. By considering factors that influenced knowledge users&#x02019; use of study findings and knowledge brokering engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we can increase research uptake and ultimately, the number of schools adopting a health-promoting schools approach. The importance of knowledge brokers reaching schools in the first year has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; sharing case studies of how phase one schools used COMPASS findings may provide motivation for schools in the next phase to use their findings and access researcher support, enhancing subsequent outcomes. However, due to funding restrictions, COMPASS knowledge brokering may proceed differently in the second phase (2017&#x02013;2021).</p><p id="Par106">Only nine of the ninety-one COMPASS schools (2012&#x02013;2016) were represented in this research, including only one school that did not engage in knowledge brokering. While perspectives of schools that engaged with knowledge brokering to varying degrees were included, the voice of schools that did not participate in knowledge brokering was limited in this research. It is possible that interview participants were from schools that viewed school health as a priority, and future research should make specific effort to examine schools that are less engaged. Second, we potentially missed perspectives of public health stakeholders that received the SHP but did not communicate with COMPASS researchers, since only public health personnel that communicated with COMPASS researchers were invited to participate. Nonetheless, the purpose of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of individual experiences to expand on quantitative findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and understand &#x0201c;what worked&#x0201d; in order to enhance schools&#x02019; experiences with COMPASS knowledge exchange in the next phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par107">This research addresses gaps in the literature related to outcomes of knowledge brokering in public health research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and knowledge translation in school health research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Findings highlight the value in providing tailored summaries to schools participating in longitudinal school health research, as schools actually used these findings to make changes. Partnerships between schools, researchers, and public health were formed, leading to benefits for all groups. Knowledge brokering provided feedback to researchers to enhance the study, contributed to low school attrition, and increased researchers&#x02019; understanding of school environments. Knowledge exchange may provide a mechanism to help schools achieve the components needed for implementing a health-promoting schools approach, increasing implementation fidelity. However, further research is needed to determine the amount of engagement required for school-level changes and examine the process of knowledge brokering to consider how to increase engagement of schools. Findings from this study are being used to strengthen knowledge exchange in the next phase of COMPASS and can also inform similar activities in school health and public health research.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>KB</term><def><p id="Par5">Knowledge broker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PH</term><def><p id="Par6">Public health staff</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par7">Principal Investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SHP</term><def><p id="Par8">School Health Profile</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VP</term><def><p id="Par9">Vice principal</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the COMPASS Project Manager for his support throughout this project.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par108">The COMPASS study was supported by a bridge grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes (INMD) through the &#x0201c;Obesity&#x02014;Interventions to Prevent or Treat&#x0201d; priority funding awards (OOP-110788; grant awarded to S.T.L.) and an operating grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Institute of Population and Public Health (IPPH) (MOP-114875; grant awarded to S.T.L.).
