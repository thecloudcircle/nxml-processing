Cnidarians, which have a radially symmetric nervous system and pacemaker centres in multiples of four, provide an interesting comparison to bilaterian animals for studying the coordination between CPGs. The box jellyfish <italic>Tripedalia cystophora</italic> is remarkable among cnidarians due to its most elaborate visual system. Together with their ability to actively swim and steer, they use their visual system for multiple types of behaviour. The four swim CPGs are directly regulated by visual input. In this study, we addressed the question of how the four pacemaker centres of this radial symmetric cnidarian interact. We based our investigation on high speed camera observations of the timing of swim pulses of tethered animals (<italic>Tripedalia cystophora</italic>) with one or four rhopalia, under different simple light regimes. Additionally, we developed a numerical model of pacemaker interactions based on the inter pulse interval distribution of animals with one rhopalium. We showed that the model with fully resetting coupling and hyperpolarization of the pacemaker potential below baseline fitted the experimental data best. Moreover, the model of four swim pacemakers alone underscored the proportion of long inter pulse intervals (IPIs) considerably. Both in terms of the long IPIs as well as the overall swim pulse distribution, the simulation of two CPGs provided a better fit than that of four. We therefore suggest additional sources of pacemaker control than just visual input. We provide guidelines for future research on the physiological linkage of the cubozoan CPGs and show the insight from bilaterian CPG research, which show that pacemakers have to be studied in their bodily and nervous environment to capture all their functional features, are also manifest in cnidarians.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) produce rhythmic behaviors across all animal phyla <xref rid="pone.0027201-Arshavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027201-Marder1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027201-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027201-Ijspeert1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

In order to approach the question of pacemaker interaction in more detail, we developed a numerical model which built on existing models in terms of using the swim pulse information of animals with a single pacemaker center (and correspondingly a single rhopalium) as a basis for modeling multiple pacemakers in a network <xref rid="pone.0027201-Satterlie4" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027201-Horridge1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027201-Lerner1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

In terms of generating the relevant IPIs, both models performed equally well. Intuitively, the subtraction mode of coupling can more straightforwardly be translated into biological correlates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027201-g008">Fig. 8</xref>): The spikes of the basic pacemaker units in each rhopalium travel around the bell via the ring nerve and nerve net and elicit muscle contractions in a one to one manner. Possibly, the connections between ring nerve and rhopalia are not only outgoing into the nerve net of the bell, but also incoming from the ring nerve into the rhopalial neuropil. Anatomic observations describe two parts of the ring nerve that branch off the main nerve bundle to enter the stalk and the rhopalia. They have been interpreted as connections between adjacent rhopalia, which allow for integration of information between the rhopalia <xref rid="pone.0027201-Garm5" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. There are hints that the activity of one pacemaker suppresses the activity of the other pacemakers <xref rid="pone.0027201-Satterlie3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters have been described for other jellyfish species <xref rid="pone.0027201-Spencer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore it is conceivable that the connections from neurons of the ring nerve to the pacemaker neurons are inhibitory, and with every spike elicited by one CPG, the other CPGs could receive hyperpolarizing inputs that decrease their membrane potentials and increase the time to the next spike. Due to the bipolarity of the nerve net of box jellyfish, the impulses can only travel around half the bell before they cancel out by running into each other and further transmission is blocked by the refractory period of the nerve fibers <xref rid="pone.0027201-Satterlie3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This way, the pacemaker which elicited a spike is not affected by any hyperpolarizing input, and its potential is reset to baseline of its regular oscillation. Depending on the strength of the inhibitory connections, different coupling strengths are possible, from only weak coupling to fully resetting and to hyperpolarizing resetting.</p><fig id="pone-0027201-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0027201.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>A functional suggestions for pacemaker coupling.</title><p>In a basic pacemaker unit (CPG) a potential oscillates from baseline to threshold, with its frequency depending on the light condition.

The pacemakers are mutually connected in an inhibitory way, transforming the spikes generated by other pacemakers into hyperpolarizing potentials, which decrease the pacemaker potentials according to the subtraction or hyperpolarizing subtraction model, respectively. By this mechanism, the spike frequency of a pacemaker is reduced if another pacemaker increases its firing frequency.

<xref rid="pone.0027201-Petie1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, the fact that the coupling of four CPGs using the probability and subtraction model was not able to account for the observed IPI distribution of animals with four rhopalia, has been described before by Satterlie and Nolen <xref rid="pone.0027201-Satterlie4" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The model in this previous study was mechanistically similar to our probability model and used fully resetting and independent coupling. The results also agree with ours in that the model interactions of two pacemakers, but not of four, produced the closest fit to the mean IPIs of animals with four rhopalia.</p><p>There are several possibilities why the average activity of two CPGs provided such good fit for the swim pulse data of box jellyfish medusae. First, there might actually be only two CPGs active at a time, while the other two are silenced by some autonomous mechanism. Evidence for this might be the observation that pacemaker signals from isolated rhopalia show periods of bursting activity which alternate with pauses of several tens of seconds <xref rid="pone.0027201-Garm4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Against this hypothesis speaks the fact no animal with one rhopalium showed comparably long intervals of immobility in our experiments. A second hypothesis, which is in conformity with our observations, assumes an external control that silences two pacemakers in random fashion, but for some reason is not active if only one rhopalium is left. However, this is a purely theoretical concept, and we cannot see any biological relevance for having four pacemakers and randomly silencing two of them.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>The hyperpolarizing subtraction model produced an adequate data fit with four pacemakers interacting</title><p>The third and biologically more plausible hypothesis to explain why the interactions of four pacemakers in the subtraction and probability model did not reproduce the experimental data well, is to assume that they did not capture all aspects of coupling between the pacemakers in box jellyfish medusae. We therefore implemented a further expanded mode of coupling in the hyperpolarizing subtraction model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027201-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, C). This model allowed the potential of a basic pacemaker unit to decrease below the baseline of resetting, by subtraction caused by spiking action of another pacemaker. It therefore increased the time to spike as compared to the probability and subtraction model. The hyperpolarizing subtraction model was able to closely reproduce the experimental IPI distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027201-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, A). Only the proportion of long IPIs and correspondingly the standard deviation of the experimental data were still underestimated by this type of coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027201-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>A functional advantage of the hyperpolarizing resetting model was that individual pacemakers gained a larger impact on the whole system. One pacemaker with a higher pulse frequency than the other pacemakers dominated the system by reducing the chance of any other pacemaker to reach threshold due to the hyperpolarizing inputs. This mechanism only works if the dominating pacemaker increases firing frequency, similar to our simulation, in which one pacemaker reacted to <italic>light-OFF</italic>, while the others continued in the constant <italic>light</italic> mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027201-g006">Fig 6</xref>, B). A pacemaker decreasing its frequency in a <italic>light-ON</italic> reaction would not become dominant. This disparity corresponds to the difference in acute relevance of the <italic>light-OFF</italic> and <italic>light-ON</italic> situation to box jellyfish medusa. A sudden decrease in light intensity is an indicator for a potential threat to the medusae, such as mangrove roots which can potentially harm the fragile body, or areas outside the light shafts, where they will not find food. With hyperpolarizing links, the system could effectively increase the swim speed of the animal to swim away from the potential threat, even if only one eye is stimulated.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>The proportion of long and short IPIs in the experimental IPI distributions was not reproduced by any of the models</title><p>Although the best fitting models &#x02013; two CPGs or four CPGs with hyperpolarizing links, respectively - captured most of the features of the IPI distributions, they did substantially underestimate the proportion of long intervals (&#x0003e;3000 ms) observed in the experiments. Interestingly, a similar result has been described before <xref rid="pone.0027201-Satterlie4" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>This finding strongly suggests additional mechanisms to pacemaker signals that control the swim speed of <italic>T. cystophora</italic> medusae. A putative source for such control is the gastrointestinal system, which might have a calming effect on medusa swim pulsing in order for the food to be processed and the manubrium (mouth) to maneuver.

However, its origins have not yet been discovered <xref rid="pone.0027201-Garm5" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It has been observed in a hydrozoan species that the stimulation of the radial musculature of the gastrointestinal system slowed down and compromised the regularity of the swimming contractions <xref rid="pone.0027201-Horridge2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

The proportion of long IPIs immediately after <italic>light-OFF</italic> stimulation was even smaller than the values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027201-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, because the swim pulse frequency was at its maximum for ten seconds after <italic>light-OFF</italic> stimulation, before the pulse rate declined again. This has been described for isolated pacemakers as well <xref rid="pone.0027201-Garm3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As discussed before, for <italic>T. cystophora</italic>, a sudden drop in light intensity indicates a situation that requires action. Therefore, if faced with such a condition, the additional regulation of swimming by another system than the visual should be suppressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results support early models of the box jellyfish pacemaker system, which propose fully resetting links between the individual pacemaker centers <xref rid="pone.0027201-Passano1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027201-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, studying the system not in terms of isolated pacemakers, but in its bodily environment, we made some unexpected findings which indicate that there is more to the system than only resetting links between for pacemaker centers. Our data supports the idea of hyperpolarizing links between the pacemakers, increasing the impact of individual pacemakers, especially in situations which indicate danger to the animal, while keeping the regularity and reliability of a multi-pacemaker system. Moreover, we found evidence for an additional mechanism, which slows down the swim pulse frequency and produces long IPIs, which do not result from a simple interaction of the four CPGs. Our results therefore provide guidelines for future research on the physiological links of cubozoan CPGs. Moreover, our results from a cnidarian system support the conclusions from recent work of pacemaker research in bilaterians, which show that CPGs have to be studied in their bodily and nervous environment in order to fully understand their characteristics and function <xref rid="pone.0027201-Prinz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027201-Chiel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0027201.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>IPIs of animals with one rhopalium and simulation of one basic pacemaker unit.
