It is expressed in T cells, where it binds to a linker for activation of T cell (LAT) family member 1 and inhibits its phosphorylation and downstream signaling events after T cell receptor triggering. The role of the 4.1R protein in cell activation through other immunoreceptors is not known. In this study, we used 4.1R-deficient (4.1R-KO) and 4.1R wild-type (WT) mice and explored the role of the 4.1R protein in the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc&#x003b5;RI) signaling in mast cells. We found that bone marrow mast cells (BMMCs) derived from 4.1R-KO mice showed normal growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and expressed Fc&#x003b5;RI and c-KIT at levels comparable to WT cells. However, 4.1R-KO cells exhibited reduced antigen-induced degranulation, calcium response, and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;. Chemotaxis toward antigen and stem cell factor (SCF) and spreading on fibronectin were also reduced in 4.1R-KO BMMCs, whereas prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>-mediated chemotaxis was not affected. Antibody-induced aggregation of tetraspanin CD9 inhibited chemotaxis toward antigen in WT but not 4.1R-KO BMMCs, implying a CD9-4.1R protein cross-talk. Further studies documented that in the absence of 4.1R, antigen-mediated phosphorylation of Fc&#x003b5;RI &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits was not affected, but phosphorylation of SYK and subsequent signaling events such as phosphorylation of LAT1, phospholipase C&#x003b3;1, phosphatases (SHP1 and SHIP), MAP family kinases (p38, ERK, JNK), STAT5, CBL, and mTOR were reduced. Immunoprecipitation studies showed the presence of both LAT1 and LAT2 (LAT, family member 2) in 4.1R immunocomplexes. The positive regulatory role of 4.1R protein in Fc&#x003b5;RI-triggered activation was supported by <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in which 4.1R-KO mice showed the normal presence of mast cells in the ears and peritoneum, but exhibited impaired passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The combined data indicate that the 4.1R protein functions as a positive regulator in the early activation events after Fc&#x003b5;RI triggering in mast cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mast cell</kwd><kwd>4.1R protein</kwd><kwd>degranulation</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>passive cutaneous anaphylaxis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Grantov&#x000e1; Agentura &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Republiky<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001824</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">17-20255S</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">17-20915S</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">18=18521S</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Akademie V&#x0011b;d &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Republiky<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004240</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="82"/><page-count count="20"/><word-count count="12717"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells of the immune system, similarly to other cell types, communicate with their environment via a plethora of surface receptors recognizing various soluble or membrane-bound ligands. Recognition of such ligands initiates intracellular signaling events resulting, depending on the overall cellular context, in the activation or inhibition of various immune effector mechanisms, cell differentiation, and/or chemotaxis. Detailed understanding of the structure-function relationships of the immunoreceptors and other surface receptors of the immune cells and identification of their interaction partners is essential for rational approaches toward the treatment of immune system-related diseases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). For example, the response of mast cells induced by antigen-mediated aggregation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc&#x003b5;RI) is potentiated by simultaneous engagement of receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), or inhibited by simultaneous engagement of the inhibitory Fc&#x003b3; receptors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Furthermore, although it is known that the transmembrane adaptor protein, phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains (PAG), is an anchor of C-terminal Src kinase, a potent inhibitor of Src family kinases, our studies with bone marrow mast cells (BMMCs) derived from mice with PAG knockout (KO) showed that PAG enhances Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced degranulation and chemotaxis responses, but inhibits c-KIT-induced degranulation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Our previous studies (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), as well as the results of other investigators (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), indicated that Fc&#x003b5;RI and c-KIT signaling is regulated not only by PAG, but also by other transmembrane adaptor proteins, linker for activation of T cell family (LAT) member 1 (LAT1) and LAT member 2 (LAT2), also called non-T cell activation linker. Other studies indicated an essential role of actin and tubulin in mast cell signaling (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), but the connection between the plasma membrane located adaptor proteins, other signal transduction molecules, and cytoskeletal components is not fully understood.</p><p>Protein 4.1R is a member of the 4.1 family that functions as a bridge between transmembrane and cytoskeletal proteins [reviewed in (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)]. This protein was initially identified in human red blood cells. Later studies showed that there are four 4.1 protein paralogs, including 4.1 R, which is specific for red blood cells, 4.1N, present in neuronal cells, 4.1G, present in numerous cell types, and 4.1B, found predominantly in the brain (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In higher animals, 4.1 proteins possess a headpiece domain, a 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain, a FERM adjacent (FA) domain, a spectrin-actin binding (SAB) domain, and a unique C-terminal (CTD) domain. 4.1R occurs in two isoforms with apparent molecular mass of 120&#x02013;135 kDa and/or 80 kDa. These isoforms are the result of splicing of the headpiece domain.</p><p>While the role of 4.1R protein in red cells has been extensively documented (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), its function in other cell types is not well-defined. It has been shown that 4.1R isoforms are present in the membrane regions, cytoplasm, and nucleus of nucleated cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It has been described that the membrane region localization of 4.1R is important for regulating the functions of several transmembrane proteins (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), plasma membrane receptors (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), transporters (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and ion channels (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Using keratinocytes from 4.1R-deficient mice, Chen et al. (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) showed that the 4.1R protein is a positive regulator of cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and motility. They also found that in 4.1R-deficient keratinocytes, the focal adhesion complexes did not localize properly and that &#x003b2;1 integrin levels were reduced. In T cells, Kang et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) described recruitment of the 4.1R protein into the immunologic synapse after T cell receptor (TCR) triggering, hyperactivation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from 4.1R-deficient mice, and hyperproliferation and increased production of interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon &#x003b3; in 4.1R-deficient T cells. The hyperactivation resulted from enhanced phosphorylation of LAT1 and its downstream signaling molecule ERK. The authors also documented that the 4.1R protein binds directly to LAT1, and thereby prevents its phosphorylation by ZAP-70 kinase. In line with these findings, the authors found that mice deficient in the 4.1R protein displayed enhanced humoral response after immunization with T cell-dependent antigen (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Further experiments showed that protein 4.1R could suppress activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and thereby prevent progression of pathogenic autoimmunity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Recently published data concluded that the 4.1R protein is also a negative regulator of TCR signaling in CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, the role of the 4.1R protein in the function of other immunoreceptors is not understood.</p><p>In the present study, we used 4.1R-deficient (4.1R-KO) mice and corresponding wild-type (WT) littermates and examined the role of 4.1R protein in the Fc&#x003b5;RI activation as reflected by degranulation, calcium response, production of cytokines, and chemotaxis in BMMCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also compared tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins involved in early signaling events after Fc&#x003b5;RI triggering in 4.1R-KO and WT BMMCs and the interaction of 4.1R protein with transmembrane adaptor proteins LAT1 and LAT2. Finally, we examined the role of 4.1R protein in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), which is initiated by antigen-IgE-mediated aggregation of Fc&#x003b5;RI in mast cells. Our data imply that in contrast to activation through the T cell immunoreceptor, activation via Fc&#x003b5;RI in mast cells is positively regulated by the 4.1R protein under <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and Cells</title><p>Generation of 4.1R-KO mice and their backcrossing onto the C57BL/6 background has been described (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).

After 30 min incubation on ice, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and samples were evaluated by flow cytometry using LSRII (BD Bioscience). Median fluorescence intensities were analyzed using FlowJo software (ThreeStar, Ashland). To analyze peritoneal mast cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 ml of PBS supplemented with 1% BSA.

These findings support the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, suggesting a direct or indirect cross-talk between 4.1R and PKA that could be responsible, at least in part, for the reduced chemotaxis in 4.1R-KO cells.</p></sec><sec><title>4.1R-KO Cells Exhibit Reduced Spreading on Fibronectin</title><p>To investigate the possible involvement of 4.1R protein in adhesion of mast cells to fibronectin, we sensitized 4.1R-KO and WT BMMCs with IgE, transferred them to the fibronectin-coated glass surface and then stimulated them or not with antigen or SCF. After 20 min, the cells were fixed, stained for actin with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin conjugate, and confocal microscopy images were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Detailed analysis of the images using CellProfiller software showed that when compared to non-activated WT cells, 4.1R-KO cells had significantly reduced ability to spread on fibronectin. After exposure to antigen or SCF, both cell types exhibited enhanced cell areas bound to fibronectin, but 4.1R-KO cells exhibited significantly reduced spreading on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>Adhesion and spreading of mast cells on fibronectin is in part dependent on &#x003b2;1-integrin (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), which is present on cell surfaces in both non-activated and activated forms. These two conformations can be distinguished and their expression on the cell surface can be monitored by flow cytometry with antibodies specific for an open (active) conformation (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and antibodies that bind both forms of &#x003b2;1-integrin. Using an antibody specific for activated &#x003b2;1-integrin, we found that in non-activated cells, there was a small but significantly higher fraction of active &#x003b2;1-integrin in 4.1R-KO cells than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1A</xref>).

When the levels of total integrin were examined, no significant differences between non-activated or antigen-activated WT and 4.1R-KO cells were noticed. However, in 4.1R-KO cells activated with SCF, total &#x003b2;1-integrin was lower than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1B</xref>).

These data suggest that the 4.1R protein in mast cells is involved in the expression of &#x003b2;1-integrin and its active form in mast cells. However, the observed pattern of &#x003b2;1-integrin expression does not explain the lower spreading of 4.1R-KO cells on fibronectin.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced Antigen-Induced Phosphorylation of Signal Transduction Proteins in 4.1R-KO Cells</title><p>Critical molecular events in Fc&#x003b5;RI signaling involve phosphorylation of the Fc&#x003b5;RI subunits and numerous enzymes and adaptor proteins, which lead to propagation of the activation signal.

BMMCs derived from 4.1R-KO mice, when compared to BMMCs from WT mice, exhibited reduced degranulation when stimulated by aggregation of Fc&#x003b5;RI with IgE-multivalent antigen complexes. The reduced degranulation was associated with changes in the Fc&#x003b5;RI signalosome and was not due to reduced expression of the surface Fc&#x003b5;RI. Furthermore, while antigen-induced phosphorylation of the Fc&#x003b5;RI &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits was not affected by the absence of 4.1R protein, tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous enzymes, which are essential players in mast cells signaling (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), was significantly reduced, implying that this could account for the reduced degranulation. Interestingly, inhibition of degranulation was also observed in 4.1R KO BMMCs stimulated by thapsigargin, which bypasses the chain of signaling events from IgE-antigen-clustered Fc&#x003b5;RI to the activation of PLC&#x003b3; and IP<sub>3</sub> production. Thapsigargin inhibits the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake ATPase (SERCA), causes depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, and triggers store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE). It is known that thapsigargin requires functional PI3K activity to induce mast cell degranulation, as was demonstrated with PI3K inhibitors (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>).</p><p>The finding that 4.1R protein deficiency in Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated cells resulted in reduced calcium response and that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response was more inhibited in cells activated by antigen than in cells activated by thapsigargin implies that multiple biochemical steps are involved in the increased levels of free intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated cells and that the 4.1R protein plays a role in some of these steps. The data showing that 4.1R-KO cells, when compared to WT cells, exhibited lower uptake of <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> after Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated activation, but the same <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake after thapsigargin-mediated activation, suggest that the 4.1R protein is not involved in the function of ion channels regulating the movement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from and into the cytoplasm.</p><p>The results of experiments showing that IgE-sensitized 4.1R-KO cells exhibited reduced chemotaxis toward antigen and SCF but not toward PGE<sub>2</sub> suggest that the reduced chemotaxis toward the antigen and SCF is not the result of the general inability of 4.1R-KO cells to move toward the chemoattractants, but is rather the result of reduced effectiveness of the signaling pathways used to generate a chemotactic signal from Fc&#x003b5;RI and c-KIT. This is also supported by the finding of enhanced or reduced chemotaxis toward antigen in cells pretreated, respectively, with PKA-specific inhibitor, H-89, or caffeine, a PKA activator. PKA as a negative regulator of mast cell chemotaxis could be involved in the process as suggested by our finding of significantly reduced phosphorylation of PKA in non-activated 4.1R-WT cells. Previously, we reported that chemotaxis of WT-BMMCs toward antigen is reduced by antibody-mediated aggregation of tetraspanin CD9 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the present study, we found that although 4.1R-KO and WT cells express comparable amounts of surface CD9, only WT cells were inhibited by anti-CD9 in their migration toward antigen. Thus, Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated chemotaxis could be in part regulated by the CD9-4.1R cross-talk. Ha et al. (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) reported that in murine macrophages, CD9 regulates secretion of IL-10 and IL-6 via the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Our finding that PKA inhibitor H-89 enhanced chemotaxis toward antigen in both 4.1R-KO and WT BMMCs, but the difference between these two cell types was preserved, suggested that there are other molecules involved in chemotaxis and affected by 4.1R. When the cells were pretreated with caffeine, which activates PKA (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), significant inhibition of chemotaxis toward antigen was observed in WT cells, as expected, but not in 4.1R-KO cells, which, however, displayed a low response. Our finding that non-activated 4.1R-KO cells exhibited enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKA could be related to the reduced migration of the cells toward antigen. The combined data suggest that 4.1R is involved in the regulation of activity of PKA, which serves as a negative regulator of chemotaxis toward antigen.</p><p>In addition to reduced chemotaxis, IgE-sensitized BMMCs from 4.1R-KO mice also exhibited impaired spreading to fibronectin. These data are in line with experiments with keratinocytes from the skin of 4.1R KO mice, which showed that their adhesion, spreading, migration, and motility were impaired when compared to WT keratinocytes (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Furthermore, the 4.1R protein in keratinocytes modulated the surface expression of &#x003b2;1-integrin, probably as a direct association of 4.1R and &#x003b2;1-integrin (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). By detailed analysis of total &#x003b2;1-integrin on the surface of mast cells from 4.1R-KO and WT BMMCs we were unable to document significant differences in the expression of total &#x003b2;1-integrin in non-activated cells or antigen-activated cells. When we examined activated &#x003b2;1-integrin, we found its increased levels in non-activated 4.1R-KO cells, but did not find any difference in antigen-activated cells. In SCF-activated cells, we found lower levels of total &#x003b2;1-integrin in 4.1R-KO than in WT cells. These data, together with the increased ratio of activated vs. total &#x003b2;1-integrin in non-activated and activated 4.1R-KO mast cells, suggest that there is a cross-talk between the 4.1R protein and surface &#x003b2;1-integrin expression and activation. This cross-talk, however, does not explain the reduced adhesion of 4.1R-KO cells to fibronectin.</p><p>A significant finding of the present study is the documentation that removal of 4.1R protein resulted in impaired phosphorylation of numerous signal-transduction proteins. As already mentioned, while the 4.1R protein did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc&#x003b5;RI &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits in antigen-activated cells, it prevented SYK tyrosine phosphorylation on residues 519 and 520, which are located in the activation loop of the kinase domain and are essential for SYK function (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). The reduced activity of the SYK kinase could be directly or indirectly responsible for the reduced phosphorylation of transmembrane adaptor protein LAT1 and PLC&#x003b3;1. LAT1 is phosphorylated by SYK and serves as a membrane anchor for PLC&#x003b3;1, which is activated by phosphorylation at tyrosine 783 by SYK (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). PLC&#x003b3; catalyzes hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate leading to the production of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), which binds to its receptor in the ER. This binding leads to the release of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm. Because phosphorylation of tyrosine 783 is required for the activity of PLC&#x003b3;1, the reduced phosphorylation of this tyrosine in 4.1R-KO cells could explain, in part, the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> and degranulation response in the 4.1R-KO cells.</p><p>Important signaling molecules, which are phosphorylated in Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated cells, are also phosphatases SHP1, SHIP, CBL, and mTOR (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). All these molecules exhibited reduced phosphorylation in 4.1R-KO cells. Reduced initial activation of SYK could be responsible for reduced phosphorylation of at least some of these molecules and several transcriptional regulators, including p38, ERK, JNK, and STAT5 (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) and could explain the reduced levels of TNF-&#x003b1; in antigen-activated 4.1R BMMCs.</p><p>In our previous study, we found that although similar in structure, LAT1 and LAT2 are located in different plasma membrane microdomains in mast cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Our present finding that the absence of 4.1R protein in Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated BMMCs leads to reduced phosphorylation of LAT1, without any effect on phosphorylation of LAT2, supports the concept that these two adaptor proteins participate differently in the formation of Fc&#x003b5;RI signalosome and exhibit different susceptibility to protein tyrosine kinases and/or phosphatases (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Immunoprecipitation studies showed that although both adaptors formed complexes with the 4.1R protein in WT cells, the absence of 4.1R protein resulted in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT1 but not LAT2. Thus, in Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated mast cells, the 4.1R protein could contribute to stabilization, enhanced phosphorylation, and optimal performance of LAT1 microdomains.</p><p>Importantly, the role of 4.1R in the activation of mast cells that we documented in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies was confirmed in the <italic>in vivo</italic> system using the widely accepted PCA assay system (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Our finding of impaired PCA performance of 4.1R-KO mice when compared to WT mice suggests that the absence of 4.1R protein significantly reduces the secretory response of ear tissue-resident mast cells.</p><p>Previous studies showed that the 4.1R protein functions as a negative regulator of TCR signaling. In T cells, the 4.1R protein exerts its effect by binding to transmembrane adaptor LAT1, and thereby prevents its phosphorylation by ZAP-70. Furthermore, mice deficient in the 4.1R protein exhibit an elevated humoral response to immunization with T cell-dependent antigen and reduced T cell-dependent tumor formation. Several lines of evidence presented in this study indicate that in contrast to T cells, the 4.1R protein functions in mast cells as a positive regulator of the Fc&#x003b5;RI signaling <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The observed discrepancy could reflect the different composition of the Fc&#x003b5;RI and TCR signalosomes. In mast cells, the Fc&#x003b5;RI signalosome possesses two transmembrane adaptor proteins, LAT1 and LAT2, which function, respectively, as positive (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>) and negative (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) regulators of Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated signaling. In contrast, T cells possess only one of these adaptors, LAT1 (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). In our previous work, we noticed that in Fc&#x003b5;RI-stimulated BMMCs, tyrosine phosphorylation of SYK is increased in LAT2-KO cells and reduced in LAT1-KO cells. Based on these results, we postulated that phosphorylation of SYK is enhanced by interaction with LAT1, but not with LAT2, and that there is a competition for SYK between these two adaptors (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In the present study, we show that 4.1R interacts with both LAT1 and LAT2 in mouse mast cells and that there are no dramatic changes in this binding after Fc&#x003b5;RI triggering. We also show that 4.1R deficiency leads to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and SYK and inhibition of all subsequent activation events. The reduced SYK phosphorylation in 4.1R-KO cells could be caused by a shift in interaction of SYK with LAT1 and LAT2 in favor of LAT2, which is a negative regulator of mast cell signaling (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It should be noted that the TCR and Fc&#x003b5;RI receptor signaling mechanisms differ in several other essential aspects, including different roles of PAG (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), C-terminal Src kinase (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and Gads (Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc) (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). All these differences could contribute to the opposite outcome of 4.1R deficiency in T cells and mast cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Mice were bred and maintained in specific pathogen-free facility of the Institute of Molecular Genetics and used in compliance with the Institute guidelines.
