The task of extracting new knowledge from large data sets is designated by the
term &#x0201c;Big Data.&#x0201d; To put it simply, the Big Data phenomenon is when the results
of your experiments cannot be imported into an Excel file. Estimated, the
volume of Twitter chats throughout a year is several orders of magnitude larger
than the volume of a person&#x02019;s memory accumulated during his/her entire life. As
compared to Twitter, all the data on human genomes constitute a negligibly
small amount [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The problem of
converting data sets into knowledge brought up by the U.S. National Institutes
of Health in 2013 is the primary area of interest of the Data-Enabled Life
Science Alliance (DELSA, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.delsaglobal.org">www.delsaglobal.org</uri>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].
</p><p>
Why have the issues of computer- aided collection of Big Data created
incentives for the formation of the DELSA community, which includes over 80
world-leading researchers focused on the areas of medicine, health care, and
applied information science? This new trend was discussed by the participants
of the workshop &#x0201c;Convergent Technologies: Big Data in Biology and Medicine.&#x0201d;
</p><p>
The total number of workshop participants was 35, including representatives of
research institutes dealing with the analysis of large experimental data sets
and commercial companies developing information systems. The workshop
participants delivered 16 short reports that were aimed at discussing how
manipulating large data sets is related to the issues of medicine and health
care.
</p><p>
The workshop was opened by Prof. Eugene Kolker, who presented a report on the
behalf of the Data-Enabled Life Science Alliance (DELSA, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.delsaglobal.org">www.delsaglobal.org</uri>).
The alliance supports the globalization of bioinformatics approaches in life
sciences and the establishment of scientific communities in the field of
&#x0201c;omics.&#x0201d; The main idea is to accelerate translation of the results of
biomedical research to satisfy the needs of the community.
</p><p>
Large data sets that need to be stored, processed, and analyzed are accumulated
in many scientific fields, in addition to biology; there is nothing surprising
about this fact. Large data sets in the field of highenergy physics imply
several dozen petabytes; in biology, this number is lower by an order of
magnitude, although it also approaches petabyte scale. The question discussed
during the workshop was what Russian researchers should focus on in the Big
Data world: either molecular biology in the &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; format, or integrative
biology in brain modeling, or social sciences?
</p><p>
The tasks of working with large data sets can be subdivided into two groups:
(1) when data are obtained interactively and need to be processed immediately
and (2) when there is a large body of accumulated data requiring comprehensive
interpretation. The former category of data is related to commercial systems,
such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook. Repositories of genomic and proteomic
data exemplify the latter type of data.
</p><p>
Systems for handling large data arrays are being developed at the Institute for
System Programming, Russian Academy of Sciences, with special attention on
poorly structured and ambiguous data that are typical of the medical and
biological fields. Collections of software utilities and packages, as well as
distributed programming frameworks running on clusters consisting of several
hundreds and thousands of nodes, are employed to implement smart methods for
data search, storage, and analysis. Such projects as Hadoop
(<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">http://hadoop.apache.org/</uri>), Data-Intensive Computing, and NoSQL are used to
run searches and context mechanisms when handling data sets on a number of
modern web sites.

Prof. Konstantin Anokhin (Scientific Research Center &#x0201c;Kurchatov Institute&#x0201d;),
talked on the fundamentally novel discipline of connectomics, which is focused
on handling data sets by integrating data obtained at various organizational
levels. Large bodies of data will accumulate in the field of neuroscience
because of the merging of two fundamental factors. First, an enormous amount of
results obtained using high-resolution analytical methods has been accumulated
in the field of neurosciences. Second, the main concern of scientists is
whole-brain functioning and how its function is projected onto the system
(mind, thought, action), rather than the function of individual synapses.
Obtaining data on the functioning of the brain as a system includes
visualization techniques: high-resolution computed tomography, light
microscopy, and electron microscopy. Megaprojects on brain simulation have
already been launched (e.g., the Human Brain Project in Europe); the
investments to obtaining new experimental data will be devalued with time,
while the analysis of the resulting data will become the highest priority.
</p><p>
Extraction and interpretation of information from existing databases using
novel analytical algorithms will play a key role in science in future. The
existence of a large number of open information sources, including various
databases and search systems, often impedes the search for the desired data.
According to Andrey Lisitsa (Research Institute of Biomedical Chemistry,
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences), existing interactomics databases coincide
to no more than 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The goal in
handling large data sets is to obtain a noncontradictory picture when
integrating data taken from different sources.
</p><p>
The concept of dynamic profiling of a person&#x02019;s health or the state of an
underlying chronic disease using entire sets of high throughput data without
reducing the dataset to the size of the diagnostic biomarker panels is being
developed at the Research Center of Medical Genetics of the Russian Academy of
Medical Sciences. The description of a normal human tissue requires one to
integrate several thousand quantifiable variables that may be derived using
genome, transcriptome and/or proteome profiling techniques; composite,
integrative measures may be used to quantify the distance that separate any two
samples. However, as each human organism has both individual genetic
predispositions and a history of environmentalal exposure, the traditional
concept of averaged norm would not be appropriate for personalized medicine
applications in its true sense. Instead, Prof. Ancha Baranova introduced the
concept of a multidimensional space occupied by set of normal sample tissue and
the tissue-specific centers within this space (&#x0201c;the ideal state of the
tissue&#x0201d;). The diseased tissues will be located at a greater distance from the
center as compared to healthy ones. The proposed approach allows one to abandon
binary (yes/no) predictions and to show the departure of a given tissue sample
as a point in an easily understandable line graph that places each sample in
the context of other samples collected from patients with the same condition
and associated with survival and other post-hoc measures.
</p><p>
Prof. Vsevolod Makeev (Institute of General Genetics, Russian Academy of
Sciences) asserted in his report that we will be dealing with large data sets
more frequently in the near future. There will be two types of data: data
pertaining to the individual genome (the 1000 Genomes Project), which are
obtained once and subsequently stored in databases to be downloaded when
required. The second type of data pertains to the transcriptome or proteome
analysis, which is conducted on a regular basis in order to obtain an
integrative personal omics profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].
There are several providers of such data in the case of genomes; Russian
laboratories can use these repositories and employ their own bioinformatics
approaches to arrive at new results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].
</p><p>
The flow of dynamic data for individuals (results of monitoring the parameters
of the organism) will increase as modern analytical methods are adopted.
Researchers will face the need for rapid processing of continuously obtained
data and for transferring the information to repositories for further
annotation and automated decision-making. There emerges the need for modifying
the technology of data storage and transfer to ensure a more rapid exchange of
information. Cloud services for storing and transferring large sets of data
exist already (e.g., AmazonS3).
</p><p>
The development of more rapid methods of mathematical analysis also plays a
significant role. The report delivered by Ivan Oseledets (Institute of
Computational Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences) focused on the
mathematical apparatus for compact presentation of multidimensional arrays
based on tensor trains (tensor train format, TT-format). Multidimensional tasks
constantly emerge in biomedical applications; the TT-format allows one to
identify the key variables that are sufficient to describe the system or
process under study.
</p><p>
Medical data need to be processed interactively so that a preliminary diagnosis
can be made no later than several minutes after the data have been obtained.
The &#x0201c;Progress&#x0201d; company is currently developing a system for remote monitoring
of medical indicators using mobile devices and the cellular network for data
transfer (Telehealth, report by Oleg Gashnikov). This method allows one to
provide 24-hour out-of-hospital monitoring of a patient, which is supposed to
reduce medical services costs in future. At this stage, techniques for forming
alarm patterns are to be developed based on accumulated data; algorithms are to
be modified for each patient.
</p><p>
The report on the problem of collecting and processing the geo location data
that are accumulated by mobile network operators and collected by aggregators,
such as Google, Facebook, and AlterGeo, appeared to lie beyond the workshop&#x02019;s
topic on the face of it. The lecturer, Artem Wolftrub (leading developer at
Gramant Ltd.), reported that a number of papers have been published by a group
led by Alex Pentland and David Laser (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
since 2009, where it has been substantiated that the analysis of geo data can
be no less informative for predicting socially important diseases than the
genome is. Environmental factors (the socalled exposome) play a significant
role in the pathogenesis of multigene diseases. Data regarding the exposome can
be obtained with a sufficient degree of detail by analyzing the relocations of
a person, by comparing the general regularities of population migrations, and
by identifying the patterns that correlate with health risks (e.g., development
of cardiovascular diseases or obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]).
</p><p>
In their discussions, the workshop participants mentioned the Watson
supercomputer in various contexts. This supercomputer was designed by IBM to
provide answers to questions (theoretically any questions!) formulated using
the natural language. It is one of the first examples of expert systems
utilizing the Big Data principle. In 2011, it was announced that the
supercomputer will be used to process poorly structured data sets in order to
solve medical and health care problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].
</p><p>
When analyzing the problem of Big Data in biology and medicine, one should note
that the disciplines have been characterized by the accumulation of large data
sets that describe the results of observations since the natural philosophy
era. During the genomic era, the aim of data accumulation seemed to be
understandable. However, as the technical aspect was solved and the genome
deciphered, it turned out that the data was poorly related to the problems of
health maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].
</p><p>
In the post-genomic era, biomedical science has returned back to the level of
phenomenological description oriented towards data collection only, without an
understanding of the prospect of its further interpretation. The Human Proteome
Project is such an example: data for each protein are collected; however, it is
not always a given that these data can be used in the applied problems of
in-vitro diagnostics. Another example is the Human Connectome Project, which is
aimed at accumulating data on signal transduction between neurons in
expectation of the fact that having been accumulated to a certain critical
level, these data will allow one to simulate human brain activity using a
computer.
</p><p>
In summary, the workshop participants noted that the Big Data phenomenon is
related to the newly available opportunity of modern technogenic media to
generate and store data; however, there is no clear understanding as to the
reason and purpose for the accumulation of such data. Russian scientists should
primarily focus on analyzing Big Data so that the data array can be converted
into hypotheses applicable for verification using a point-wise biochemical
experiment. The task of getting acquainted with the data accumulated within the
&#x0201c;Connectome&#x0201d; Project is bound to be the main direction of development at the
Russian subgroup of DELSA.
