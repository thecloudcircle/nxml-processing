Neuromodulatory signals are thought to be critical for establishing stable behavioral states and for orchestrating transitions between them. However, we have only a limited understanding of how neuromodulatory systems act <italic>in vivo</italic> to alter circuit performance and shape behavior. To address these questions, we have investigated neuromodulatory signaling in the context of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> egg-laying. Egg-laying activity cycles between discrete states&#x02013;short bursts of egg deposition (active phases) that alternate with prolonged quiescent periods (inactive phases). Here using genetic, pharmacological and optogenetic approaches for cell-specific activation and inhibition, we show that a group of neurosecretory cells (uv1) located in close spatial proximity to the egg-laying neuromusculature direct the temporal organization of egg-laying by prolonging the duration of inactive phases. We demonstrate that the modulatory effects of the uv1 cells are mediated by peptides encoded by the <italic>nlp-7</italic> and <italic>flp-11</italic> genes that act locally to inhibit circuit activity, primarily by inhibiting vesicular release of serotonin from HSN motor neurons. This peptidergic inhibition is achieved, at least in part, by reducing synaptic vesicle abundance in the HSN motor neurons. By linking the <italic>in vivo</italic> actions of specific neuropeptide signaling systems with the generation of stable behavioral outcomes, our study reveals how cycles of neuromodulation emanating from non-neuronal cells can fundamentally shape the organization of a behavioral program.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Animals have robust mechanisms in place to shape their behavior in a manner that is beneficial both for their survival and for the survival of their progeny.

In many cases behaviors are composed from discrete, opposing behavioral states. Examples of behaviors that are organized in this manner range from the motor programs underlying feeding or locomotion to more complex behaviors such as mood or arousal [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In each of these cases, animals adapt their behavior in response to either changes in environmental conditions or internal physiological signals by modifying the duration of component behavioral states.</p><p>How the nervous system establishes the duration of particular behavioral states and executes transitions between them, however, is largely unclear. Neuromodulators such as neuropeptides are attractive candidates for orchestrating these processes [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pharmacological, biochemical, and electrophysiological studies have shed light on how neuropeptide signaling can modify the activity of neural circuits [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Neuropeptide signals typically activate or refine patterns of neural activity that are generated from the actions of fast-acting transmitters by altering cellular excitability or by modifying the efficiency of synaptic communication between neurons. However, precisely linking <italic>in vivo</italic> activation of specific neuromodulatory systems with changes in circuit performance and the generation of alternate behavioral outcomes remains a challenge. Uncovering basic principles by which neuromodulators influence circuit activity and behavior in more simple systems provides an important framework for tackling similar questions in the mammalian brain. In particular, the neural circuit controlling egg-laying behavior in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> provides a relatively simple and experimentally tractable system to address these questions.</p><p>Under favorable conditions, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> egg-laying behavior cycles probabilistically between two alternative states: active phases containing short bursts of egg-laying and prolonged periods of quiescence (inactive phases) [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This temporal organization of egg-laying allows for spatial dispersal of eggs, and may be beneficial for survival of progeny by limiting local overcrowding and competition for food. The core circuitry and signaling machinery controlling egg-laying is well described, but the mechanisms responsible for this temporal organization have remained unclear. Egg-laying occurs when specialized sex-specific muscles contract, opening the vulva and allowing for deposition of eggs. Two serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSN) and two cholinergic ventral C class motor neurons (VC4 and VC5) make excitatory synaptic contacts onto the Vm2 muscles [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Egg-laying active states are associated with serotonin release from the HSNs that increases vulval muscle excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><fig id="pgen.1006697.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006697.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Reducing the activity of neurosecretory uv1 cells increases egg-laying.</title><p>(A) Schematic diagram of the egg-laying circuit.

The uv1 cells do not form synaptic connections with the egg-laying circuitry, but express candidate neuromodulators (e.g. FMRFamide peptides, tyramine), raising the possibility that secretion of neuromodulators from the uv1 cells may allow for temporal coordination of egg-laying activity [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. By linking acute cell-specific activation to alternate behavioral outcomes, we demonstrate that uv1 secretion of neuropeptides encoded by the <italic>nlp-7</italic> and <italic>flp-11</italic> genes inhibits HSN-vulval muscle transmission, setting the duration of inactive phases during egg-laying. Unlike the other neurotransmitter systems described to date involved in the inhibition of egg laying, NLP-7 and FLP-11 peptides do not strictly depend on G<sub>i/o</sub> G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Instead, inhibition involves redundant functions of G<sub>i/o</sub> and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory receptor-like protein EGL-47. Our studies support a model where neuropeptide signaling controls the temporal organization of opposing behavioral states by altering synaptic vesicle abundance in motor output neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Altering uv1 activity affects the timing of egg-laying events</title><p>To begin to address the role of the uv1 cells in neuromodulatory control of egg-laying, we first asked whether manipulations that alter uv1 activity affect the retention of eggs <italic>in utero</italic>, an indirect measure of egg-laying activity. Wild type adults typically retain about 15 eggs <italic>in utero</italic> under normal laboratory conditions. We used cell-specific expression of a histamine-gated chloride channel (HisCl1) to selectively hyperpolarize the uv1 cells [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The <italic>ocr-2</italic> promoter region and 3&#x02019; UTR regions provide for selective expression in the uv1 cells and a few additional head and tail neurons [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Using these regulatory regions to drive HisCl1 expression, we silenced uv1 cells with exposure to exogenous histamine (6 hrs) and then measured the number of eggs retained in the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Transgenic animals expressing HisCl1 without exposure to exogenous histamine retain a similar number of eggs to wild type. Histamine-mediated hyperpolarization of the uv1 cells causes a significant reduction in the number of eggs <italic>in utero</italic> (31%, p &#x0003c; 0.0001), consistent with an increased rate of egg-laying. To investigate this further, we next asked whether hyperpolarization of the uv1 cells altered the temporal organization of egg-laying events by monitoring egg-laying in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Under favorable growth conditions, bouts of egg-laying (clusters) are separated by prolonged inactive phases (15&#x02013;60 mins) in which eggs are retained in the uterus. We found that uv1 hyperpolarization causes a significant shift towards shorter inactive phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to determine whether uv1 activation is sufficient to inhibit egg-laying. To address this question, we expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in uv1 cells using the regulatory regions of <italic>ocr-2</italic> as above. Light stimulation immediately following the initial egg-laying event of an active phase (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>) significantly delays subsequent egg-laying events, and also significantly reduces the total number of egg-laying events within an active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g002">Fig 2</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s008">S1 Movie</xref>). For example, under control conditions a majority (~80%) of animals show a delay between the first and second egg-laying events within an active phase of &#x0003c;20 s (light stimulation, -ATR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This proportion is reduced dramatically (to around 10%) when uv1 cells are activated (light stimulation, +ATR). In addition, a significant fraction of uv1 activated animals (~33%, compared with 11% of controls) halt egg-laying for &#x0003e;5 mins following light stimulation, likely indicating termination of the active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Of the animals that progress to a second egg-laying event, the average time interval between the first and second egg-laying events increases from roughly 12 s under control conditions to nearly 38 s with uv1 depolarization. Approximately 30% of the animals tested lay 5 or more eggs within an active phase under control conditions, but active phases with &#x0003e;5 events are not observed with uv1 depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Moreover, about 60% of uv1-activated animals lay &#x02264;2 eggs after light stimulation compared to just 22% of animals under control conditions. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that uv1-mediated inhibition of egg-laying promotes periods of quiescence in the egg-laying program and plays a key role in setting their duration.</p><fig id="pgen.1006697.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006697.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Acute stimulation of uv1 cells inhibits egg-laying activity.</title><p>(A) Temporal analysis of egg-laying behavior for 400 s immediately following photostimulation of animals stably expressing ChR2 in the uv1 cells (<italic>vsIs189</italic>; <italic>Pocr-2</italic>::<italic>ChR2</italic>::<italic>YFP</italic>::<italic>ocr-2</italic> 3&#x02019;UTR) under control conditions (-ATR) or with exposure to exogenous retinal (+ATR).

To test whether NLP-7 and FLP-11 may be acting cooperatively to regulate egg-laying, we investigated egg-laying behavior in <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic> double mutants. Strikingly, we found that the double mutants retain significantly fewer eggs <italic>in utero</italic> than either wild type or the respective single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).

Thus, our findings suggest that either class of peptides, if present at sufficient levels, is capable of slowing the rate of egg-laying. Indeed, transgenic expression of <italic>nlp-7</italic> increases the retention of eggs <italic>in utero</italic> beyond wild type levels, suggesting that a chronic increase in circulating levels of NLP-7 peptides may be sufficient to produce prolonged inhibition of the egg-laying circuit and deficits in egg-laying.</p><p>To address whether specific peptide expression in the uv1 cells is sufficient to rescue constitutive egg-laying in <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic> mutants, we expressed either <italic>nlp-7</italic> or <italic>flp-11</italic> under the control of <italic>ocr-2</italic> regulatory sequence. uv1-specific expression of either peptide precursor completely reverses hyperactive egg-laying, supporting the idea that the uv1 cells are an important endogenous source of these peptides for regulation of egg-laying (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g002">Fig 2</xref>, uv1 stimulation in control animals increases the interval between egg-laying events and reduces the number of events during an active phase. For depolarization of uv1 cells in <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic> double mutants, the interval between consecutive egg-laying events is significantly decreased compared to uv1 stimulation in controls. Moreover, 90% of <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic> double mutants perform &#x02265;3 egg-laying events following light stimulation compared with 40% of controls that perform &#x02265;3 events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>). These results support the idea that secretion of NLP-<italic>7</italic> and FLP-11 peptides in response to stimulation of the uv1 cells is sufficient to inhibit egg-laying. However, we note that the effects of uv1 stimulation are not completely reversed in <italic>nlp-7;flp-11</italic> double mutants, consistent with the possibility that other modulatory signals may also contribute to uv1 regulation of egg-laying.</p><p>To determine which aspects of the egg-laying behavioral program may be subject to modulation by NLP-7 and FLP-11 peptides, we monitored the timing of egg-laying events in freely moving animals.

These findings demonstrate that an acute rise in NLP-7 peptide levels is sufficient to block egg-laying in adult animals, and the time course of these effects suggests that the actions of NLP-7 are transient, consistent with the predicted modulatory effects of a neuropeptide.</p><p>We next pursued cell type-specific overexpression of <italic>nlp-7</italic> to decipher where peptide expression may be required for modulation of egg-laying. Our prior expression studies revealed that <italic>nlp-7</italic> is expressed in cells proximal to the vulva (uv1 and VC4/5) as well as in neurons near the head and tail that are distal to the core egg-laying circuit. An analysis of the <italic>nlp-7</italic> promoter region revealed a 2.5 kb fragment that drove predominant expression in the head and tail neurons, but provided more limited expression in the egg-laying circuit (fluorescence in egg-laying cells was visible in roughly 60% of animals). Using this 2.5 kb promoter to drive expression, we investigated egg-laying in the group of animals where we were able to confirm <italic>nlp-7</italic> expression was restricted to head and tail neurons. Selective expression in head and tail neurons does not produce an appreciable difference in the developmental stage of embryos at the time of egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), indicating that expression in these neurons alone is not sufficient for modulation of egg-laying activity. We also analyzed egg-laying in the group of animals for which we observed <italic>nlp-7</italic> expression in both head and tail neurons and the egg-laying cells (uv1 as well as more variable expression in the VC4 and VC5 neurons) using the shorter 2.5 kb <italic>nlp-7</italic> promoter fragment. We noted a significant increase in the fraction of eggs laid at later developmental stages in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). To decipher which cells may be most critical, we used cell-specific promoters to drive overexpression of <italic>nlp-7</italic>. Surprisingly, despite the spatial proximity of the VC4 and VC5 neurons to the HSNs and vulval muscles, specific expression of <italic>nlp-7</italic> in the VC neurons (<italic>lin-11</italic> promoter fragment) does not alter egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). In contrast, specific expression in the uv1 cells (using <italic>ocr-2</italic> promoter and 3&#x02019; UTR) produces a striking shift in the developmental stage of eggs at the time of egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g005">Fig 5I</xref>), similar to that observed using the 3.5 kb native <italic>nlp-7</italic> promoter. Together, our results support the idea that local NLP-7 release from uv1 cells is required for modulation of egg-laying activity. Further, the inability to elicit changes in egg-laying activity with expression in neighboring VC neurons may point toward a specialized role for the uv1 cells within the circuit.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>NLP-7 and FLP-11 reduce the activity of the egg-laying circuit</title><p>Synaptic release from the HSN neurons onto vulval muscles is a key factor in the control of egg-laying activity. Therefore, to begin to address the question of how the behavioral effects of peptide modulation may be encoded within the egg-laying circuit, we next investigated whether neuropeptide signaling altered responsiveness in this core egg-laying pathway. Prior work showed that photostimulation of transgenic animals that express ChR2 in the HSNs is sufficient to elicit an active period of egg-laying [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We therefore asked whether neuropeptide signaling affected bouts of egg-laying elicited by HSN photostimulation. We quantified egg-laying events in response to a 60 s period of light stimulation, measuring the time interval between the onset of light exposure and the initial egg-laying event as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>](<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s010">S3 Movie</xref>). As expected, control animals expressing ChR2 respond in a dose-dependent manner to blue light stimulation&#x02013;the time interval to the initial egg-laying event decreased with increasing light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>nlp-7</italic> overexpression completely blocks egg-laying responses to HSN photostimulation. Whereas almost 60% of wild type animals respond within 20 secs of blue light exposure, NLP-7 OE animals show no response within the 60 s period of light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Likewise, higher light intensities (up to 200 W/m<sup>2</sup>) do not elicit egg-laying responses in NLP-7 OE animals (none of the animals tested respond within 60 s, n = 30). Thus, altering peptide levels can have profound effects in this core HSN-muscle pathway, suggesting that NLP-7 and FLP-11 peptides likely inhibit egg-laying behavior either by acting to inhibit neurotransmitter release from the HSN neurons or by reducing responsiveness of egg-laying muscles.</p><fig id="pgen.1006697.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006697.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>NLP-7 and FLP-11 regulate the activity of the egg-laying circuit.</title><p>(A) Schematic diagram depicting optogenetic stimulation of the HSN neurons.

Prior work demonstrated that the egg-laying defects produced by serotonin deficiency are reversed by supplying exogenous serotonin [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Egg-laying responses elicited by ChR2 activation of the HSNs approach wild type levels in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), providing additional evidence that NLP-7 inhibition of egg-laying is reversible with increases in HSN signaling. Finally, we asked whether increasing muscle synaptic activation could suppress NLP-7 mediated inhibition of egg laying. Cholinergic transmission at synapses between VC neurons and egg-laying muscles operates in parallel with HSN signaling onto muscles to control their excitability. Vulval muscles express acetylcholine receptors that are responsive to the nematode-specific cholinergic agonist levamisole, and exposure to exogenous levamisole stimulates egg-laying [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We increased cholinergic synaptic activation of muscles by expressing a gain-of-function muscle acetylcholine receptor (L-AChR<italic>(gf)</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Transgenic expression of L-AChR<italic>(gf)</italic> in otherwise wild type animals increases egg-laying activity, producing a constitutive phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). In contrast, expression of L-AChR<italic>(gf)</italic> in NLP-7 OE animals does not appreciably change the rate of egg-laying, indicating that elevated cholinergic synaptic activation of muscles cannot reverse the inhibition produced by increased levels of NLP-7 signaling.

Therefore, we were unable to pursue a similar genetic analysis of FLP-11 signaling. This could be due to a functional property of the FLP-11 signaling pathway or may indicate that our strategies for increasing neuropeptide expression were less effective for FLP-11. Nonetheless, our findings for NLP-7 argue that these peptides act primarily to control levels of serotonin secretion from the HSNs. Prior work showed that HSNs exhibit spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations even in the absence of synaptic inputs [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, our findings suggest a model where local neuropeptide release from the uv1 cells may control circuit activity, in part by shaping the timing of vesicular serotonin release from the HSNs.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>NLP-7 regulates synaptic vesicle abundance in the HSN neurons</title><p>To gain additional support for peptide regulation of HSN transmission, we next examined the distribution of synaptic vesicles at HSN synapses onto vulval muscles.

We did not observe significant changes in the morphological features of the HSN neurons in either of the neuropeptide single mutants or in <italic>nlp-7;flp-11</italic> double mutants. Likewise, the total synaptic volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) and the number of synaptic varicosities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) within the HSN process are unaffected by single or combined deletion of the <italic>flp-11</italic> and <italic>nlp-7</italic> neuropeptide precursors, suggesting that the sizes of the synaptic region are not altered.

In principle, the increase in vesicle abundance could affect either egg-laying activity during the active phase or the length of the quiescent period. Despite increased SNB-1::GFP, we did not observe a significant change in the number of egg-laying events/active phase for either <italic>nlp-7(lf)</italic> single mutants and <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic> double mutants (wild type: 3.8&#x000b1;0.3; <italic>nlp-7(lf)</italic>: 4.1&#x000b1;0.3; <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic>: 3.2&#x000b1;0.2), supporting the idea these peptides act primarily to increase the length of the quiescent period. Deletion of <italic>flp-11</italic> did not produce an appreciable difference in SNB-1::GFP intensity, suggesting that HSN regulation may be primarily mediated through NLP-7 peptides, while FLP-11 peptides may modulate egg-laying activity via another mechanism. Conversely, we noted a significant decrease in SNB-1::GFP fluorescent intensity in NLP-7 OE animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>), though the total volume of the synaptic region remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Finally, DsRed2 fluorescent intensity (expressed under the same promoter as SNB-1::GFP) in either the synaptic region or the HSN cell body is not significantly affected by combined peptide deletion or by NLP-7 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006697.g008">Fig 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s005">S5E Fig</xref>), providing evidence that the changes in SNB-1::GFP fluorescence we observe do not arise via transcriptional regulation of the reporter.

Our work supports this model and extends it in several important aspects. First, we show that activating or inhibiting the uv1 cells produces predictable changes in the periodicity of egg-laying. Second, we identify two neuropeptide precursors, NLP-7 and FLP-11, that are expressed in uv1 cells and work cooperatively to set the duration of inactive phases during egg-laying. For both neuropeptide precursors, specific expression in the uv1 cells is sufficient to slow the rate of egg-laying, suggesting that local secretion solely from uv1 cells can account for their effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. Third, we show that <italic>nlp-7</italic> overexpression produces robust and sustained inhibition of egg-laying, and provide evidence that this occurs through negative regulation of serotonin signaling from the HSN neurons. Finally, genetic ablation or overexpression of <italic>nlp-7</italic> produce opposing effects on synaptic vesicle abundance in the HSN neurons. Genetic alteration of <italic>flp-11</italic> levels does not reproduce these effects, suggesting <italic>flp-11</italic> may act via another mechanism or target another cell type in the circuit. Together, our findings support a model where peptides derived from NLP-7 and FLP-11 are coordinately secreted from uv1 cells to modify egg-laying circuit activity and shape the temporal organization of egg-laying behavior. We propose that the secretion of NLP-7 and FLP-11 peptides from uv1 cells promote egg-laying quiescent periods by reducing serotonin release from the HSN neurons. This is achieved, at least in part, by regulating the abundance of serotonergic synaptic vesicles in the HSN neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006697.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Prior work showed that neuropeptides encoded by the <italic>flp-1</italic> gene promote the onset of egg-laying active phases [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is therefore appealing to speculate that the NLP-7/FLP-11 and FLP-1 neurotransmitter systems act antagonistically to shape egg-laying behavior. One intriguing possibility is that FLP-1 peptides primarily act in response to sensory stimuli (such as food availability) to alter an intrinsic rhythm established through the actions of NLP-7/FLP-11 signaling.</p><p>Our studies indicate that local neuropeptide signaling plays a central role in establishing behavioral rhythmicity during egg-laying. In particular, we find that cell-specific expression of <italic>flp-11</italic> or <italic>nlp-7</italic> is sufficient to rescue egg-laying defects or, in the case of <italic>nlp-7</italic>, produce sustained inhibition of egg-laying. Interestingly, cell-specific expression of <italic>nlp-7</italic> in VC motor neurons did not reproduce these effects, even though these neurons are located in close proximity to both HSN neurons and egg-laying muscles. This finding points toward the idea that the uv1 cells perform specialized neurosecretory functions in halting egg-laying. For example, uv1 cells may be specialized for properly coordinating the timing of neuropeptide release with egg-laying activity or perhaps possess expanded capacity for neuropeptide release compared with neighboring neurons. Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to assess uv1 function directly. These cells are an essential structural component of the egg-laying anatomy, limiting the value of ablation studies or mutants deficient in uv1 development for addressing questions about function [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Prior studies exploited a dominant mutation in the TRPV channel <italic>ocr-2</italic> to strongly implicate uv1 cells in the regulation of egg-laying, but mechanistic interpretation of these studies is complicated by our limited understanding of the effects of the mutation on channel functional properties [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We used expression of a histamine gated chloride channel to inhibit uv1 activity. Prolonged inhibition of the uv1 cells in adult animals significantly reduces the length of the inactive phase of egg-laying. A recent study found that calcium transients occur in uv1 cells immediately following egg-laying events during an active phase [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting that repetitive stimulation of uv1 cells may be required for inhibition of egg-laying. We speculate that each egg-laying event may trigger release from the uv1 cells, ultimately leading to local increases in peptide levels sufficient to terminate the active phase and delay re-entry into the subsequent active phase. This model is supported by several observations: (1) ChR2 depolarization of uv1 cells delays subsequent egg-laying events in an active phase and even terminates the active phase in a subset of animals. (2) The effects of uv1 stimulation are almost completely eliminated in double mutants lacking NLP-7 and FLP-11 peptides. (3) uv1-specific rescue or overexpression of <italic>flp-11</italic> and <italic>nlp-7</italic> demonstrate that high levels of either peptide are sufficient to inhibit egg-laying. Moreover, induced expression of NLP-7 peptides in adults slows egg-laying within two hours and these effects begin to reverse by four hours. uv1 cells may share interesting parallels with oxytocin (OT) neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus that are involved in the control of lactation. Secretion of OT (and subsequently milk ejection) is not temporally locked to the initiation of suckling but instead must surpass a certain threshold during suckling for a burst of OT release and milk ejection to occur [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similarly, we speculate that uv1 cells require a buildup of egg-laying events during an active phase to achieve sufficient levels of NLP-7 and FLP-11 peptides to terminate an active phase. These neuropeptides may also work in concert with other modes of uv1 signaling. For example, genetic disruption of tyraminergic signaling produces defects in egg-laying and prior work showed that tyramine was present in the uv1 cells [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As is the case for <italic>nlp-7;flp-11</italic> double mutants, the effects of tyramine deficiency are incomplete, suggesting that these signals may cooperate to alter circuit performance in complex ways.</p><p>While our work supports the idea that neuropeptide secretion from uv1 cells is key for proper temporal organization of egg-laying, the nature of the sensor that triggers peptide secretion remains an open question. All of our studies are performed under constant favorable external conditions. Therefore, peptide secretion from uv1 cells is likely triggered by sensing a change in the internal state of the organism, perhaps by sensing egg-laying status. Based on their anatomical position and expression of mechanosensory TRPV channels, the uv1 cells have been proposed to sense the mechanical load of the uterus [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consistent with this idea, recent evidence indicates that uv1 cells are mechanically deformed with the passage of eggs through the vulva [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, mechanical deformation of the uv1 cells may directly trigger rises in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and peptide secretion.</p><p>Our genetic analysis of <italic>nlp-7</italic> overexpression provides evidence that NLP-7 peptides act primarily at the level of the HSNs to inhibit egg-laying. We found that combined mutation of <italic>egl-47</italic> and <italic>goa-1</italic> completely suppress the effects of <italic>nlp-7</italic> overexpression. Prior work demonstrated that each of these genes mediate their effects on egg-laying by acting primarily in the HSN neurons [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], although <italic>goa-1</italic> expression in vulval muscles or uv1 cells may also contribute [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is difficult to conclusively demonstrate that the HSN neurons are the sole site of action for these peptides in the egg-laying circuit because high-affinity receptors for NLP-7 peptides have not yet been identified, and the cellular expression of several putative FLP-11 receptors remains uncharacterized. <italic>egl-6</italic> encodes the sole GPCR that has been previously demonstrated to show expression in the HSN neurons, but NLP-7 peptides do not activate EGL-6 <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Though a precise mechanism for EGL-47 action remains unclear, our finding that mutation of <italic>egl-47</italic> partially restores egg-laying in NLP-7 OE animals raises the intriguing possibility that EGL-47 may act directly as a receptor for NLP-7 peptides. <italic>egl-47</italic> encodes a seven-transmembrane protein related to <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory receptors [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Initial studies suggested that <italic>egl-47</italic> may be an orphan GPCR [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], while more recent studies suggest that EGL-47 inhibition of egg-laying may occur through activation of an associated chloride channel [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. While gain-of-function <italic>egl-47</italic> mutation inhibits egg-laying, our studies here are the first to demonstrate a phenotype associated with <italic>egl-47</italic> loss of function. In addition, our findings reveal that the egg-laying defects of NLP-7 overexpressing animals are completely suppressed only by combined mutation of <italic>egl-47</italic> and <italic>goa-1</italic>. This observation points towards the interesting possibility that multiple receptors might act downstream of NLP-7 signaling&#x02013;perhaps EGL-47 in combination with GOA-1 (G<sub>i/o</sub>)-coupled GPCR(s). Further characterization of EGL-47 and other potential NLP-7 receptors is an important subject for future studies. Several potential FLP-11 receptors have been identified to date [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], but expression of these receptors in the egg-laying circuit has not yet been demonstrated. In our studies, FLP-11 expression in the uv1 cells was sufficient for rescue of constitutive egg-laying in <italic>nlp-7;flp-11</italic> double mutants, but overexpression did not produce obvious defects, preventing pursuit of a genetic suppressor approach to identify the GPCR(s) involved.</p><p>Our studies also address the question of how peptides secreted from the uv1 cells modulate egg-laying. Our analysis of SNB-1::GFP fluorescence in the HSN neurons offers support for the idea that NLP-7 peptides act, at least partially, by modulating HSN transmission onto egg-laying muscles. We observed an increase in SNB-1::GFP fluorescence at HSN synapses in <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic> mutants, and a strong decrease with <italic>nlp-7</italic> overexpression. Because the total synaptic volume and number of varicosities are unaffected, we propose that these fluorescence changes reflect altered synaptic vesicle density. We therefore interpret our findings to indicate that peptidergic signaling alters synaptic vesicle abundance in the HSN neurons. This interpretation is supported by our HSN photostimulation studies where we found that <italic>nlp-7(lf);flp-11(lf)</italic> double mutants exhibit enhanced egg-laying responsiveness to HSN depolarization, while NLP-7 OE animals are resistant. Prior work has identified mechanisms for intrinsic regulation of HSN activity [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In particular, the potassium channel IRK-1 is important for inhibition of HSN activity by the EGL-6 GPCR. Although acting independently of EGL-6, NLP-7 and FLP-11 peptides might similarly exert their effects by inhibiting HSN activity. Our analysis of SNB-1::GFP fluorescence is not however consistent with the peptides acting solely via this mechanism. For example, if NLP-7 peptides inhibited egg-laying simply by decreasing HSN activity, we might expect an increase in SNB-1::GFP fluorescence at synapses due to a reduced rate of vesicular release. Surprisingly, we observe that NLP-7 mediated inhibition of egg-laying is associated with a strong decrease in SNB-1::GFP intensity, suggesting other processes contribute. One possibility is that chronic peptidergic inhibition of the HSNs leads to a compensatory decrease in the production of synaptic vesicles. Alternatively, neuropeptide signaling may directly modulate the rate of synaptic vesicle trafficking to HSN synapses. This possibility appears unlikely because we do not observe increased SNB-1::GFP intensity in the HSN cell bodies of NLP-7 OE animals, as would be expected if vesicles were accumulating in the HSN soma. Finally, peptidergic signaling may directly alter rates of HSN synaptic vesicle recycling or biogenesis. A previous report demonstrated that serotonin expression in the HSNs is altered by G-protein signaling [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our findings may suggest the presence of a parallel mechanism in the HSNs for regulating vesicle production. This would be consistent with our observation that SNB-1::GFP intensity is decreased at both HSN synapses and in HSN cell bodies of NLP-7 OE animals. Interestingly, we also observed that SNB-1::GFP fluorescent intensity is significantly increased at HSN synapses in <italic>nlp-7</italic> single mutants, but these animals do not display significant egg-laying defects and likewise are not hypersensitive to HSN photostimulation. These results argue that changes in HSN synaptic vesicle abundance alone cannot fully account for the actions of FLP-11 and NLP-7 peptides in the egg-laying circuit.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate a mechanism by which local neuropeptide secretion from a group of non-neuronal cells produces relatively long-lived inhibition of circuit activity and behavioral quiescence by modulating serotonergic transmission. HSN motor neurons exhibit spontaneous activity, and serotonin release from the HSNs is associated with a transition from the inactive to active phase of egg-laying [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We propose that cycles of neuropeptide release from the uv1 cells reversibly inhibit HSN transmission and structure the timing of egg-laying by both promoting inactive phases and preventing rapid re-entry into active phases. More broadly, our studies elucidate a mechanism by which neuromodulatory systems modify circuit activity to specify the timing of transitions between opposing behavioral states. Advancing our knowledge of how neuropeptides and other modulators act in the context of the circuits in which they are endogenously released will be critical in ongoing efforts to understand how alternate behavioral states, for example those underlying mood or arousal, are encoded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Strains</title><p>All nematode strains were maintained at 20&#x000b0;C on agar nematode growth media plates seeded with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>Coli</italic> OP50.

Total SNB-1::GFP volume, number of SNB-1::GFP varicosities and GFP::SYD-2 clusters in the HSN synaptic regions were determined as described in [<xref rid="pgen.1006697.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Mean SNB-1::GFP and SYD-2::GFP intensities at HSN synapses were determined by averaging the mean GFP fluorescence intensities from all SNB-1::GFP and SYD-2::GFP varicosities in a single HSN process (within 10 &#x003bc;m of the vulval slit) and subtracting the threshold value (1000 units or 1500 units above mean background fluorescence for SNB-1::GFP or SYD-2::GFP respectively). DsRed2 intensities were measured similarly in the same exact regions occupied by SNB-1::GFP.</p><p>SNB-1::GFP and DsRed2 intensities in HSN cell bodies were determined by calculating their mean intensities within each cell body and subtracting the threshold value (1500 units above background).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1006697.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title><italic>nlp-7</italic> gene structure, mutation and expression.</title><p>(A) Representative confocal images showing distribution of the dense core vesicle marker IDA-1::GFP (green) in a single uv1 cell.
