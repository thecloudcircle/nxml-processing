It is fifth in popularity and third in cancer-related deaths worldwide <xref rid="pone.0018878-Farazi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Prognosis and treatment of HCC remains unsatisfactory due to tumor recurrence, metastasis of the primary tumor and poor therapeutic response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy <xref rid="pone.0018878-Mathurin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Kawano1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Metastasis is not only a complex process but also the major cause of cancer-related deaths <xref rid="pone.0018878-Liotta1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Transformation of cells to a fibroblastic phenotype is important for the cancer cells to successfully metastasize <xref rid="pone.0018878-Stracke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Several lines of evidences suggested that the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in cancer cell transformation <xref rid="pone.0018878-Larue1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Thiery1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It contributes significantly to metazoan embryogenesis and pathogenesis such as tissue fibrosis and cancer progression <xref rid="pone.0018878-Moustakas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. On the other hand, the process of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) may promote the growth of the metastatic cancer cells in secondary sites <xref rid="pone.0018878-Chaffer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The critical hallmarks of EMT include the down-regulation of E-cadherin which is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene <xref rid="pone.0018878-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, activation of Rho small GTPases such as Rac1/RhoA which may increase cell motility by up-regulating actin turnover and formation of focal adhesion <xref rid="pone.0018878-Boivin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, cytoskeletal rearrangement and nuclear translocation of several transcription factors such as Snail and Twist <xref rid="pone.0018878-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Teng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Understanding the mechanism of HCC cell migration and metastasis may have great value to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for treatment of HCC patients.</p><p>Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family. Our previous study had shown that up-regulation of Pyk2 in tumor tissues of HCC patients is significantly associated to poor prognosis <xref rid="pone.0018878-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Moreover, forced overexpression of Pyk2 in HCC cells promotes cell proliferation, invasion and migration via the activation of the c-Src and ERK/MAPK pathways which can be attenuated by forced overexpression of its C-terminal non-kinase region (PRNK)<xref rid="pone.0018878-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, Pyk2 up-regulates the formation of lamellipodia and actin stress fiber polymerization of HCC cells <xref rid="pone.0018878-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, the underlying mechanism of Pyk2 on regulation of cell transformation and motility of HCC cells is poorly understood. Recently, some of the signaling molecules associated with Pyk2 (Hic-5 and STAT5b) have been reported to promote EMT <xref rid="pone.0018878-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Avraamides1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Therefore, it is valuable to investigate the effect of Pyk2 on regulating these molecular in the process of cell transformation of HCC cells.</p><p>Hydrogen peroxide inducible clone-5 (Hic-5) is a 55 kDa protein that serves as an adaptor protein in focal adhesion and possesses the ability to translocate to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor <xref rid="pone.0018878-Shibanuma1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It maintains the general structure of paxillin with 4 N-terminal LD motifs and 4 C-terminal LIM domains <xref rid="pone.0018878-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Tumbarello1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The LIM domain of Hic-5 is able to bind with DNA fragments in a zinc-finger-dependent manner <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting its possible role as a transcription factor <xref rid="pone.0018878-Nishiya1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Pyk2 can physically interact with Hic-5 and subsequently phosphorylate Hic-5 <xref rid="pone.0018878-Matsuya1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It has been reported that activated Pyk2 phosphorylates Hic-5 at tyrosine residue 60 resulting in up-regulation of LPA-mediated cell migration and the induction of EMT through a RhoA/ROCK-dependent pathway <xref rid="pone.0018878-Avraamides1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Ishino1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Tumbarello2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. So far the interaction between Pyk2 and Hic-5 in HCC is still unknown.</p><p>STAT5b belongs to the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) family which are activated by cytokines and transcription factors via its dimerization and nuclear translocation. They are involved in a variety of cell processes including cell proliferation, cells survival and differentiation <xref rid="pone.0018878-Klampfer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Quesnelle1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Bunting1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. STAT5b has been reported to promote EMT in HCC by the transformation of HCC cells into an aggressive phenotype. It has been shown that the activation of STAT5b is closely associated with the X protein of the Hepatitis B virus <xref rid="pone.0018878-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we hypothesize that Pyk2 transformed HCC cells to a fibroblastoid phenotype through regulation of genes associated with EMT. To validate the hypothesis, Hep3B cells were stably overexpressed with full length Pyk2 and MHCC97L cells were stably transfected with PRNK to suppress the Pyk2 activation.

Suppression of Pyk2 in MHCC97L-PRNK cells resulted in a loss of nuclear staining of STAT5b. Positive staining of STAT5b was observed in the peri-nuclear region and the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018878-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed the down-regulation of STAT5b expression in MHCC97L-PRNK cells compared to that in MHCC97L-vector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018878-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). In MHCC97L cells, suppression of Pyk2 activation by PRNK resulted in down-regulation of other mesenchymal genes such as Twist, N-cadherin and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018878-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0018878-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0018878.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Effects of Pyk2 on the activation of STAT5b.</title><p>(A) Pyk2 over-expression did not increase activation of STAT5b in Hep3B cells (green, white arrow).

In this study, the role and underlying molecular mechanism of Pyk2 on transformation of HCC cells to undergo EMT were investigated. Forced overexpression of Pyk2 in Hep3B cells transformed the cells from an epithelial phenotype to a migratory phenotype which is commonly acquired by cancer cells to induce EMT leading to the increase of metastatic potential <xref rid="pone.0018878-Tse1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Enhanced formation of membrane ruffles and migration ability in Pyk2-overexpressing Hep3B cells suggested the promoting effect of Pyk2 on cell motility of HCC cells. Increased activation of Rac1/RhoA in Hep3B-Pyk2 cells indicated that Pyk2 might promote cell motility of HCC cells via regulation of Rac1/RhoA activity. Suppression of Pyk2 in a metastatic HCC cell line MHCC97L showing a repression of EMT and cell migratory ability of the cells also indicated the importance of Pyk2 in regulation of cell motility of HCC cells.</p><p>The constitutive expression of E-cadherin in both normal and cancer cells may help to maintain adherence junctions and subsequently decrease the cell's capacity to invade or migrate through the extracellular matrix <xref rid="pone.0018878-Vleminckx1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Frixen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. E-cadherin is frequently down-regulated during tumor progression. Loss of E-cadherin is associated with increased tumorigenecity and metastasis of cancer cells, providing a close correlation between metastasis and EMT <xref rid="pone.0018878-Birchmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Down-regulation of E-cadherin is usually coupled with an up-regulation of N-cadherin <xref rid="pone.0018878-Agiostratidou1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this study, overexpression of Pyk2 in Hep3B cells resulted in a down-regulation of E-cadherin expression while suppression of Pyk2 by PRNK in MHCC97L cells significantly up-regulated the expression of E-cadherin, suggesting the important mechanism of Pyk2 on the regulation of adhesiveness of HCC cell via regulation of E-cadherin expression.</p><p>The transcription factor, Hic-5, plays important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis of human cancers including prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0018878-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0018878-Deakin1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Hic-5 is also a crucial EMT regulator of cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0018878-Tumbarello1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Tumbarello2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of Pyk2 in Hep3B cells up-regulated the activation of Hic-5 and its focal adhesion localization. Moreover, suppression of Pyk2 activation in MHCC97L cells down-regulated the membrane localization of Hic-5. Hic-5 is a Pyk2-binding protein which is phosphorylated by Pyk2 at tyrosine residue 60 upon physical interaction <xref rid="pone.0018878-Matsuya1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Ishino1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Given the role of Hic-5 on cell transformation as reported by other investigators <xref rid="pone.0018878-Avraamides1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Tumbarello2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it may be one of contributing factors to the Pyk2-mediated cell transformation in HCC. STAT5b and Twist have been reported to promote aggressiveness and EMT of cancer cells in HCC <xref rid="pone.0018878-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrated that Pyk2 also regulated the expression of STAT5b and Twist in HCC cells, suggesting a multiple regulatory roles of Pyk2 on EMT associated genes.</p><p>In this study, forced overexpression of Pyk2 in epithelial cancer cell line Hep3B up-regulated the mesenchymal gene expression. However, some of the mesenchymal genes were not up-regulated in this study. This may be explained by the partial mesenchymal characteristics of the Hep3B cells, which resulted in an incomplete induction of EMT by Pyk2. In contrast, suppression of Pyk2 activation in MHCC97L cells resulted in the down-regulation of the expression a series of mesenchymal genes including STAT5b, Twist, N-cadherin and fibroectin. These results showed that Pyk2 regulated the expression of mesenchymal genes and promoted the migratory characteristics of HCC cells which can be attenuated by the forced expression of PRNK to suppress Pyk2 activation. For cells with a mesenchymal phenotype (MHCC97L cells), transfection of PRNK successfully transformed the cells to an epithelial phenotype, with the down-regulation of mesenchymal gene expression and up-regulation of epithelial gene expression. E-cadherin was up-regulated with the down-regulation of N-cadherin. The results showed that suppression of Pyk2 by PRNK transformed the cells from a mesenchymal phenotype, to an epithelial phenotype, by undergoing mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). These results confirmed the involvement of Pyk2 in the regulation of EMT of HCC cells.</p><p>Both EMT and MET are important processes in cancer progression. The induction of EMT in cancer cells may enhance their cell motility and invasiveness so that to facilitate the development of metastasis <xref rid="pone.0018878-Teng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018878-Hay1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Subsequently, circulating tumor cells must undergo MET to initiate growth in a secondary site <xref rid="pone.0018878-Hugo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Failure of MET induction in bladder cancer cells resulted in micrometastasis, instead of secondary tumors, as shown by experimental models <xref rid="pone.0018878-Chaffer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the MET process could be made to inhibit the development of cancer metastasis by preventing secondary tumor formation. In this study, we had shown that the process of both EMT and MET are regulated by the alternation of Pyk2 activation. Overexpression of Pyk2 in Hep3B cells resulted in the induction of EMT. On the other hand, transfection of PRNK in MHCC97L cells resulted in the induction of MET, suggesting that prevention of focal adhesion by targeting of Pyk2 may transform HCC cells from a mesenchymal phenotype to an epithelial phenotype. However, its underlying mechanism is still unclear and thus considered to be worthwhile for further study. Our previous study also demonstrated that the suppression of Pyk2 by PRNK domain in MHCC97L cells can suppress <italic>in vivo</italic> intrahepatic tumor growth and venous invasion as well as extrahepatic lung metastasis <xref rid="pone.0018878-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Together, our data suggested the possible role of Pyk2 in the regulation of EMT, MET and metastasis in HCC cells.</p><p>Our study demonstrated the important role of Pyk2 on controlling cell motility of HCC cells through regulation of genes associated with both mesenchymal and epithelial transformations.
