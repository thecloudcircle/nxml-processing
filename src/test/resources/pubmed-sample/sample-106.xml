Hence, considering the most recent publications (2017&#x02013;2019),<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> we have systematically carried out this analysis.</p><p>Our current analysis showed that maternal complications such as pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, fetal loss, stillbirth, and abortion were significantly higher in pregnant women with SLE. The risk for cesarean section was also increased in such patients.</p><p>In addition, fetal complications such as preterm birth, infants who were small for gestational age, infants who had a low birth weight, newborns admitted to the NICU and newborns with an APGAR score &#x0003c;7 within 1 and 5 minutes, respectively were significantly higher in infants born from mothers with SLE.</p><p>Our current analysis has complete support from other recently published studies. A retrospective study conducted in Southern China also showed with full evidence, the association of adverse pregnancy outcomes including pregnancy loss and preterm delivery in women with SLE.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> The authors also stated that umbilical artery Doppler was a good method to monitor these adverse pregnancy complications during the third trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>Apart from these pregnancy outcomes, other studies have shown maternal SLE to be associated with dyslexia, attention deficit, and speech disorders in offspring due to developmental issues.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>Because reproductive issues are common in women with SLE, pre-pregnancy assessment to identify highly at risk women, and counseling advice should be given to women if pregnancy is to be avoided.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>Even if updated guidelines were published for the management of pregnant SLE patients, another recent study showed that even with low molecular weight heparin and aspirin use during pregnancy, maternal and perinatal complications occurred frequently<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> which might not be a positive response to therapy. However, other measures such as a predictive model for fetal loss to identify high risk pregnancies, as shown in a Chinese retrospective study might be helpful to these women with SLE.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>This analysis had the following limitations: several baseline features of the participants were not listed since they were not reported in the original studies. Therefore, important information such as the duration of disease were not available. There was insufficient information about the follow-up of these patients and the medications used during this pregnancy period, and this might have had an impact on the outcomes. In addition, since this analysis involved observational data, confounding variables and bias were observed. Because this analysis was based on studies which were published after the year 2016, the total number of studies that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria was less. However, we could not include studies that were published during or before the year 2016 since another previous meta-analysis was already based on studies published before the year 2016.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the most recent studies (2017&#x02013;2019), we could conclude that maternal and fetal complications were significantly higher in SLE-associated pregnancy. Therefore, SLE should still be considered a severe risk factor for pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Validation:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Visualization:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Wen Rong He, Hua Wei.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: APS = antiphospholipid syndrome, CI = confidence intervals, PIH = pregnancy induced hypertension, RR = risk ratios, SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>How to cite this article: He WR, Wei H.
