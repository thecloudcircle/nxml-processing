Here, we study the role of ACh in the transition of corneal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and in consequence its role in the onset of fibrosis, in an in vitro human corneal fibrosis model. Primary human keratocytes were obtained from healthy corneas. Vitamin C (VitC) and transforming growth factor&#x02010;&#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x02010;&#x003b2;1) were used to induce fibrosis in corneal fibroblasts. qRT&#x02010;PCR and ELISA analyses showed that gene expression and production of collagen I, collagen III, collagen V, lumican, fibronectin (FN) and alpha&#x02010;smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA) were reduced by ACh in quiescent keratocytes. ACh treatment furthermore decreased gene expression and production of collagen I, collagen III, collagen V, lumican, FN and &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA during the transition of corneal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, after induction of fibrotic process. ACh inhibited corneal fibroblasts from developing contractile activity during the process of fibrosis, as assessed with collagen gel contraction assay. Moreover, the effect of ACh was dependent on activation of muscarinic ACh receptors. These results show that ACh has an anti&#x02010;fibrotic effect in an in vitro human corneal fibrosis model, as it negatively affects the transition of corneal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Therefore, ACh might play a role in the onset of fibrosis in the corneal stroma.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd id="jcmm15168-kwd-0001">collagens</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15168-kwd-0002">cornea</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15168-kwd-0003">fibrotic markers</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15168-kwd-0004">keratocytes</kwd><kwd id="jcmm15168-kwd-0005">scarring</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source>V&#x000e4;sterbotten County Council &#x02018;Spjutspetsmedel&#x02019;</funding-source><award-id>VLL&#x02010;363161</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-0002"><funding-source>V&#x000e4;sterbotten County Council&#x000a0;ALF</funding-source><award-id>VLL&#x02010;549761</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-0003"><funding-source>Kronprinsessan Margaretas Arbetsn&#x000e4;mnd f&#x000f6;r synskadade KMA</funding-source><award-id>2013/10</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-0004"><funding-source>Swedish Society of Medicine</funding-source><award-id>SLS&#x02010;504541</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-0005"><funding-source>Cronqvist foundation</funding-source><award-id>SLS&#x02010; 691711</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-0006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>&#x000d6;gonfonden </institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/100010810</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-0007"><funding-source>Swedish Research Council</funding-source><award-id>2017&#x02010;01138</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="8743"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>April 2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:5.8.1 mode:remove_FC converted:23.04.2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

</p><p>Transforming growth factor&#x02010;&#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x02010;&#x003b2;1) is a cytokine essential for the induction of the fibrotic response.

Additionally, cells were pre&#x02010;treated with 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>M atropine to examine whether mAChR activation is necessary to carry the ACh effect. The results showed that ACh effect was no longer present when mAChRs were blocked. Secretion of collagen III was not affected by ACh treatment during the fibrosis process. Interestingly, secretion of collagen V increased after treatment with both 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>M and 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>M ACh at days 2 and 4.

Based on our previous studies on ACh and keratocytes,<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> we tested two concentrations of ACh: 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>M and 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>M. Our results showed that ACh decreased gene expression of all markers tested, with 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>M of ACh having bigger effect at earlier time point. Moreover, ACh also decreased secretion of pro&#x02010;collagen I. We chose to determine the secretion of pro&#x02010;collagen I instead of collagen I as it has been reported that keratocytes in cell culture are not able to process all pro&#x02010;collagen I to mature collagen I, and as a result, pro&#x02010;collagen I accumulates in the cell medium with only a small portion being processed to mature collagen I.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> Moreover, ACh had no effect on collagen III secretion and we could not detect secreted collagen V. Interestingly, we have shown that ACh stimulates keratocytes to proliferate<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>; therefore, we hypothesized that ACh would possibly increase expression of ECM and fibrotic markers. Surprisingly, our results showed the contrary, and the reason for that should be studied.</p><p>The role of ACh in fibrosis has been investigated in airway diseases and in liver fibrosis, for which it has been shown that ACh is involved in ECM remodelling and proliferation of myofibroblasts,<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> but no data exist on its possible role in corneal fibrosis. We have adapted an in vitro human corneal fibrosis model from Karamichos et al<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> in order to study the role of ACh in the onset of fibrosis and its effect on the transition of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. In this model, vitamin C and TGF&#x02010;&#x003b2;1 are used to induce fibrotic process in corneal fibroblasts. Vitamin C has been shown to induce synthesis and secretion of ECM components,<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> especially collagen I, without altering non&#x02010;collagen protein synthesis such as fibronectin.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> Transforming growth factor&#x02010;&#x003b2;1 stimulates overproduction and deposition of ECM.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Using this model, we were able to induce overproduction of ECM components (collagen I, collagen III, collagen V and lumican) and expression of the fibrotic markers FN and &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA in newly formed myofibroblasts, which presence was confirmed by gel contraction assay.</p><p>Again, our results showed that ACh had an inhibitory effect on the formation of fibrosis and myofibroblasts in our model. It down&#x02010;regulated gene expression of collagen I, collagen III, collagen V and lumican. Secretion of pro&#x02010;collagen I and lumican was decreased; however, secretion of collagen III was unaffected by ACh. Interestingly, secretion of collagen V was enhanced by ACh. However, the results showed that the intracellular content of collagen V was decreased by ACh. Perhaps, the ACh&#x02010;treated cells were able to secrete collagen V more rapidly, but the total content of collagen V (intracellular&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;secreted) was unaffected by ACh treatment, as was the case for collagen III, for which ACh had no effect on either its secretion or its intracellular levels. Moreover, ACh decreased gene expression and secretion of FN, which might explain the lower levels of secreted collagen I, as FN is responsible for its deposition during fibrosis.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> We have found no apparent difference in action between the two concentrations of ACh used. Our results also suggest that the anti&#x02010;fibrotic effect of ACh is mediated by activation of mAChRs. In our previous study, we found that ACh treatment in keratocytes activates mAChRs rather than nAChRs,<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> in order to enhance keratocyte proliferation. Perhaps, the activation of mAChRs, rather than nAChRs, in keratocytes and corneal myofibroblasts leads to an anti&#x02010;fibrotic response, rather than a pro&#x02010;fibrotic one, as it has been reported for airways that activation of &#x003b1;7 nAChR is involved in the progression of lung fibrosis.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> Studies have shown contradicting results regarding the role of the mAChR antagonist atropine in fibrosis. Atropine has been found to have an anti&#x02010;fibrotic effect in hepatocytes isolated from rat fibrotic liver<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>; however, others have shown that atropine has pro&#x02010;fibrotic properties in rat cardiac fibroblasts.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> Our results suggest that atropine alone does not affect the fibrotic process in corneal fibroblasts. However, it is possible that it affects collagen secretion.</p><p>Finally, we showed that ACh hinders transition of corneal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, as demonstrated by down&#x02010;regulation of &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA and subsequent inhibition of development of contractile activity by the fibroblasts. Again, this effect was shown to be mediated by activation of mAChRs, since the usage of atropine increased the contractile activity of the cells. The effect of ACh was dose&#x02010;dependent with higher concentration inhibiting the contraction more. Importantly, we showed that ACh (only the lower concentration) decreased keratocyte migration, which further supports our hypothesis and shows that ACh has an effect under more physiological settings, as mechanical wounds or chemical burns are one of the most common reasons for corneal injury. We think that during injury, ACh affects the keratocytes in a way that they remain quiescent or that they are activated in a slower manner. The reason for ACh not having an effect on fibroblast migration during the onset of fibrosis is perhaps because of the experimental settings, that is very high amount of FBS, which under physiological conditions would be omitted.</p><p>The small, but significant, decrease in fibrotic markers by ACh observed in this study could have potential clinical application. The physiological conditions differ greatly from the in vitro settings, and at least up to this date, it is hard to reproduce the physiological conditions. Issues such as substrate stiffness will affect the in vitro experiments, and isolation of the cells from their natural environment will, to a degree, change them too.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> We expected to see a significantly bigger decrease in &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA expression, as contraction of the collagen gels, in which the corneal fibroblasts are embedded, was decreased greatly by the ACh&#x02010;treated cells. Perhaps, &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA removal from the stress fibres is somehow deficient, or &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA is not properly degraded. One study showed that when inducing apoptosis in fibroblasts, &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA was degraded by caspase&#x02010;3.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> We have previously shown that ACh has an anti&#x02010;apoptotic effect on keratocytes.<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> Therefore, we could speculate that a similar mechanism inhibits &#x003b1;&#x02010;SMA degradation in this study. Additionally, as ACh increases proliferation of corneal fibroblasts during the onset of fibrosis, the small changes observed could be a result of that. Perhaps treating the cells with ACh after arresting the cell cycle could result in a bigger and clearer change.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that ACh displays anti&#x02010;fibrotic characteristics in an in vitro human corneal fibrosis model. ACh impedes overproduction of ECM components and hampers expression of fibrotic markers, and this effect is driven by activation of mAChRs. Therefore, ACh not only might play a regulating role during the initial stages of corneal fibrosis, but also might decrease an already&#x02010;existing fibrosis. Hence, perhaps it contributes to reduced scarring of the cornea. Our findings are promising, as it has been reported by Uberti et al<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> that kinetically energized ultra&#x02010;low doses of ACh show remarkably great wound healing properties both in vitro in human keratinocytes and in vivo in mice. Even though our results cannot be directly compared with Uberti's findings, throughout our studies on ACh in corneal wound healing, we have observed that the lower dose of ACh exerts stronger wound healing and anti&#x02010;fibrotic effects. Moreover, it seems that the kinetically energized ultra&#x02013;low&#x02010;dose ACh is safe for topical applications to skin in pre&#x02010;clinical studies, which would be very promising and beneficial for treating corneal wounds. Additionally, it might be interesting to study whether application of anti&#x02010;cholinergic drugs such as tropicamide, atropine or cyclopentolate, which are commonly administered for the purpose of ocular examination in order to dilate the pupil,<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> or application of cholinergic drugs such a pilocarpine, which is used to constrict the pupil in the treatment of angle closure glaucoma,<xref rid="jcmm15168-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> will have a negative or positive effect, respectively, on persons with wounded corneas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="jcmm15168-sec-0025"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="jcmm15168-sec-0026"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>MS and PD participated in research design.
