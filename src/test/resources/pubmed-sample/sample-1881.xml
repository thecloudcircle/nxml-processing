This is especially true for such ones containing <italic>Stevia</italic> leaves, <italic>Stevia</italic> extracts, or steviol glycosides. A multi-imaging profiling was developed exploiting hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). A minimalistic sample preparation, different mixtures of acetonitrile and water/buffer on the silica gel phase as well as derivatization reagents and optional hyphenation with high-resolution mass spectrometry were exploited. The hydrophilic interaction high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HI-HPTLC) development took 10&#x000a0;min for 48 analyses. It was used to screen <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf extracts and 20 different food products. For the first time, the biological and biochemical profiling of <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf products by HI-HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD-assay pointed to 19 different bioactive compound bands found in the more natural multicomponent <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf extracts, whereas most of these activities were not existent for the steviol glycosides. The chemically isolated, purified, and EU-regulated steviol glycosides ease risk assessment and food product development. However, multipotent botanicals may have subtle impact on homeostasis via several metabolic pathways, providing benefits for the consumer&#x02019;s health. Analyzed side by side by means of the effect-directed profiling, their individual activity profiles were visualized as image and individual substances of importance were pointed out. Multi-imaging (comprehensive detection) plus non-targeted bioprofiling (focus on known and unknown bioactivity) allows for a fast detection of questionable product changes that occur along the global food chain and are particularly related to food safety.</p><p id="Par2">

It is known that official methods may lack in detecting adulterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], as most analytical methods are tailored with regard to extraction, separation, and detection to the analysis of selected target compounds. The status quo methods by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS or -MRM) confirm such target compounds, but do not necessarily point to other compounds that matter. Often, it is forgotten that not every compound is ionizable by electrospray ionization (ESI) under standard MS settings. This makes, without prior knowledge on potential changes along the global product chain, most analytical mainstream techniques blind for contaminations, residues, adulterations, or other unauthorized additions. Only holistic methods are capable to solve this gap. However, most analytical techniques in this respect are time-consuming, complicated, analyze only a selected part of the sample (due to the required sample preparation), or are not robust for transfer to other laboratories.</p><p id="Par4">Until now, various analytical techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] have been used for the determination of steviol glycosides in food and <italic>Stevia</italic> leaves. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] is considered to be powerful for its unbiased overview on most, but not all metabolites present in a sample. Routine NMR lacks in the relevant ability to detect (ultra) trace components, but these do matter when coming along with strong biological or biochemical effects. Furthermore, enzymatic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], electroanalytical techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], capillary electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], desorption electrospray ionization MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], paper spray-MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], near infrared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and Raman spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were exploited as analytical tools. However, mainly HPLC with different detectors (UV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], ELSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) or high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) with different derivatization reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] were used. Among these, a fast reversed phase HPLC-MS/MS method was reported for analysis of seven steviol glycosides (not all baseline separated), isosteviol, and steviol in <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf extracts, with a total run time of 9&#x000a0;min per sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A good resolution of up to 13 steviol glycosides was obtained within 20&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Samples of a simple composition like table top sweeteners and beverages were directly analyzed after dilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In more complex food, however, the main challenge is the separation of the steviol glycosides from any interfering matrix of similar chemical nature. An additional, tailored sample clean-up was required for each type of food matrix, like dairy products, sauces, or biscuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The workflow strongly depended on the coeluting matrix preset. Depending on the food matrices, the otherwise powerful HILIC separation of steviol glycosides lacks in reproducibility, stable retention times, and constant peak profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Matrix-matched calibration, standard addition, or the use of an internal standard were exploited for a proper quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It is evident that research on analytical techniques is still needed to establish holistic methods for challenging food samples. Also, HPTLC-MS needs to be automated. This has been addressed to manufacturers since 2005 because in a retrospective view, all chromatographic techniques were boosted and did highly benefit upon hyphenation with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Fully automated elution head-based and desorption-based devices were built and successfully demonstrated in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], respectively. Latest innovation was a cost-effective, open-source add-on kit for automating zone elution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] which was designed to fill the longstanding scientific gap and advance HPTLC-MS.</p><p id="Par5">Presently, steviol glycosides without an off-flavor containing more saccharide moieties, and thus a higher molecular weight, are a hot topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Produced via microbial fermentation at a higher quantity, these are generally recognized as safe, though not yet in the EU. Steviol and isosteviol are less polar degradation products of steviol glycosides, which may degrade under certain processing and storage conditions. Strongly acidic or fermented heat-treated food matrices may challenge their stability. Such breakdown products should not be present in <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf and food products. Rarely, methods include the analysis of breakdown products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], although this is of high interest to confirm stability in the different food matrices.</p><p id="Par6">The reliable quantification of steviol glycosides in <italic>Stevia</italic> leaves, <italic>Stevia</italic> extracts, and food products/formulations by planar chromatography was reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, in this study, the analyte focus was extended by such representatives containing a higher number of saccharide moieties. A straightforward method for their screening in different food matrices was intended to be developed, which is able to efficiently analyze products on the global market. <italic>Stevia</italic> plants are differently cultivated and leaf extracts are diversely processed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Therefore, the composition of products can vary and a non-target effect-directed profiling was aimed to be developed for a comprehensive study of potential effects deriving from <italic>Stevia</italic> leave extracts in comparison with steviol glycosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Such assays with the most important outcome may be selected as assay candidates for future bioprofiling performed in routine with regard to quality control and safety of products.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par7">Bidistilled water was produced by a Heraeus Destamat Bi-18E (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany).

Instead of adding the chemically isolated, purified, and EU-regulated steviol glycosides to food, the addition and consumption of the more natural leaf extracts or the leaves themselves might have benefits for health. Though <italic>Stevia</italic> leaves were used in traditional medicines for diverse purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], effect-directed in vitro assays have hardly been performed so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In order to obtain more information on the individual bioactivities of <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf extracts versus steviol glycosides, a non-targeted bioprofiling was developed. This bioanalytical technique consisted of a chromatographic separation and a biological or biochemical detection. Four <italic>Stevia</italic> leave products were extracted with ethanol-water 4:1 as well as ethyl acetate for their effect-directed analysis. Each was prepared as a 1% suspension (ESM Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), which was found to be a sufficiently high concentration to start with the effect-directed analysis. The mobile phase of acetonitrile-water was perfectly suited for application of the different assays, as it contained no acid or base.</p><p id="Par34">After the HILIC separation, the chemical profiles of the four <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf extracts pointed to red fluorescent chlorophylls and blue fluorescent phenolic compounds being present (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>a&#x02013;c). The latter were confirmed to be flavonoids by derivatization of the same chromatogram with the natural product reagent (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]). Instead of immersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], piezoelectric spraying was exploited and optimized for all applied derivatization reagents regarding spray volume, nozzle, and level. Another chromatogram was subjected to the universally detecting anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent; the steviol glycosides turned green and yellow (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>e). The individual steviol glycoside colors were investigated in detail (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The three rhamnose containing glycosides (Reb N, Reb C, and Dul A) turned yellow by this derivatization on the HPTLC plate silica gel 60 F<sub>254</sub> after heating at 110&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min. This color did change to olive green for a prolonged heating period or on plates without fluorescence indicator (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> a versus c). Especially the steviol glycosides of critical pairs were colored green and yellow. This was found to be helpful, as coeluting compounds would be indicated by a yellow halo effect, in contrast to the zones of the same brown hue obtained after derivatization with the 2-naphthol sulfuric acid reagent (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>f). By these physicochemical characterizations via multi-imaging (six detection modes performed on three plates, ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), diverse information on the leaf samples was collected. All observed compounds were spread along the developing distance, which was a good precondition to proceed with the biological or biochemical detection.</p><p id="Par35">Enzyme solutions and bacteria suspensions were piezoelectrically sprayed on the plate for the first time for all nine assays. After an initial investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], the workflow was streamlined and optimized with regard to prewetting, spray volume, spray nozzle, spray level, intermediate drying, and positive controls. Nine chromatograms were prepared analogously and subjected to the nine different effect-directed assays (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These detected antibacterials (i.e., against Gram-negative <italic>A. fischeri</italic> and Gram-positive <italic>B. subtilis</italic> bacteria), various enzyme inhibitors (i.e., against tyrosinase, &#x003b1;-glucosidase, &#x003b2;-glucosidase, AChE, BChE, and &#x003b2;-glucuronidase), and radical scavenging compounds (DPPH<sup>&#x02022;</sup> assay). As proof of the proper performance of each assay, a respective positive control was selected according to importance, significance, and costs. Before the assay application, each positive control was applied bandwise at three different volumes and thus amounts on the upper plate edge (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). This general practice was found to be efficient because it did not afford an extra track and optimization of separations, but clearly proved the proper performance of the assay. The proper color formation on the plate background was considered as negative control. A blank of each extraction solvent was applied as control on an edge track, but did not contribute to the effect-directed signals discussed later. Information on a potential side reaction of the chromogenic substrate other than that with the enzyme can also be obtained. This was exemplarily performed for the chromogenic substrate Fast Blue B&#x000a0;salt solution used in the &#x003b1;-glucosidase, &#x003b2;-glucosidase, AChE, and BChE assays.

Multipotent multicomponent botanical mixtures may have subtle impact on homeostasis via several metabolic pathways. The more natural leaf extracts contained up to 19 different bioactive compounds, whereas the steviol glycosides (applied at comparable amounts) showed only a prebiotic effect for the selected Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and a comparatively weak tyrosinase inhibition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

Band 9 additionally inhibited the &#x003b2;-glucuronidase. Bands 12 and 13 in leaf extract IV were also active as &#x003b2;-glucuronidase inhibitors and radical scavengers. All nine assays revealed bioactive compounds present, among which the detected antimicrobials against Gram-positive <italic>B. subtilis</italic> bacteria were not so pronounced, as a comparatively higher application volume of the leave extracts was required to obtain a response. The total analysis time for 20 samples in parallel depended on the assay (between 1&#x000a0;h and 4&#x000a0;h). The instantly bioluminescent <italic>A. fischeri</italic> bioassay or the DPPH<sup>&#x02022;</sup> radical scavenging assay were fastest and took 3&#x000a0;min/sample, whereas due to the long incubation time (3&#x000a0;h), the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> bioassay took 12&#x000a0;min/sample. Enzyme assays took 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;min/sample depending on the total incubation time. Running costs are about 0.5 Euro/sample. For routine bioprofilings, the choice of an assay depends on what information about an effect is desired for quality control and safety of products.

In contrast to the prebiotic effect observed for the steviol glycosides (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), it proved that these 24 saccharides were not bioactive, even not&#x000a0;for application as high as 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/band (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>b). However, steviol and isosteviol showed an antibacterial activity that was stronger than that of the positive control caffeine (comparison of the 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/band applications in ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>b).</p><p id="Par47">Nevertheless, in case of saccharide interferences, the use of the highly selective primuline reagent followed by fluorescence measurement at 366/&#x0003e;&#x02009;400&#x000a0;nm is superior, as it detects vice versa the steviol aglycon site instead of the saccharide moiety. It physisorbs to the apolar site and detects steviol glycosides as blue fluorescence, but not saccharides and most derivatives in case of being present. Hence, as an example, the same analysis was performed using the primuline reagent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g&#x02013;i</xref>). The primuline reagent detects the steviol glycosides less sensitive and the applied volumes needed to be multiplied by 7. As a benefit, this reagent is compatible to direct HPTLC-HRMS recording, as it does not change the mass signals in the mass spectra recorded. In the ion source, the weakly physisorbed primuline easily separates from the steviol glycosides and is detected separately. A blue fluorescent band deformation was observed for some samples (ID 7 to 10 and 17) that interfered also with Reb A. This was observed first at the 7-fold higher volume applied (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref> versus e). In common, these five samples contained not only rebaudioside A, but also erythrit. This was also true for the erythrit-containing sample ID 11, which had a higher sweetening power. However, its lower erythrit content did not cause this interference, but it was detected now as additional blue fluorescent compound (not distorted). Hence, a higher erythrit content caused this band interference, and higher erythrit additions were easily detectable as such. Nevertheless, the blue fluorescent interference was not caused by erythrit itself, because primuline does not detect erythrit. It can be a lipophilic additive in erythrit-containing formulations, which was not clear by the given labelling. Not even showing a single steviol glycoside, the falsified sample ID 6 (ESM Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) was easily discovered by this reagent, too.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>2-Step separation of steviol, isosteviol, and steviol glycosides</title><p id="Par48">The joint detection of steviol glycosides, steviol, and isosteviol as blue fluorescent bands at UV 366&#x000a0;nm by the primuline reagent (physisorption to the lipophilic moiety) was investigated in our previous HPTLC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The plate developed up to 60&#x000a0;mm was cut in the plate middle. The lower plate part containing the steviol glycosides was detected by the 2-naphthol sulfuric acid reagent. The upper plate part containing steviol and isosteviol (near the solvent front) was developed and detected with the primuline reagent (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). This 2-step approach for baseline separation of steviol and isosteviol was transferred to the new HILIC-type separation. Steviol and isosteviol also eluted with the solvent front with the more polar HILIC solvents. However, their band shapes were&#x000a0;distorted by an apolar impurity present in the steviol glycoside mixture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>, tracks S3 and S4, better visible in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref> via the primuline reagent-detecting lipophilic compounds). This was proven by another development of steviol and isosteviol on separate tracks, for which the band shape was good. The impurity was a lipophilic bioactive (inhibited &#x003b2;-glucuronidase and AChE) compound in the standard mixture which was&#x000a0;distorted during migration in the polar mobile phase used for the steviol glycoside separation and impaired the steviol and isosteviol bands. As expected, in a more apolar mobile phase, the band shape of the impurity was even, but steviol glycosides were not resolved (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>, remained at the start zone).</p><p id="Par49">Since the band impairment increased with increasing amounts of the steviol glycoside mixture on the plate, a more sensitive derivatization reagent was considered. Analogous to the primuline reagent, steviol, isosteviol, and steviol glycosides can be detected together via the anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent. The latter was more sensitive than the primuline reagent, i.e., needed only the 4-fold (anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent) instead of 7-fold application volumes (primuline reagent) when compared with 2-naphthol sulfuric acid reagent as reference. First when heated at a higher temperature (160&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C instead of 110&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), steviol and isosteviol were detectable as blue-colored band. The additional sensitive detection of steviol and isosteviol as blue fluorescent bands was advantageously (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Also with this reagent, the falsified sample ID 6 was eye-catching und directly discovered. The six erythrit-containing samples (ID 7 to 11 and 17) that interfered with rebaudioside A were easily detected as such because the more diffuse erythrit zone was derivatized to a pink (heated 110&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, workflow I in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) or yellow zone (160&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, workflow II and III in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) when using the anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent. As the temperature of the derivatization reaction had a visible influence on the color formation of erythrit (pink or yellow) and rhamnose-containing steviol glycosides (yellow or olive green), it had to be kept constant for reproducible results. The same had to be applied for the capturing parameters and subsequent electronic treatments of the image. When individually chosen for each image (e.g., white adjust and spot amplification tools), differences were evident (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Three options for 2-step separation of steviol, isosteviol, and steviol glycosides: workflow I (20&#x000a0;min analysis time, 10&#x000a0;mL solvent consumption, but impaired by an impurity) versus workflow II (60&#x000a0;min analysis time, 14&#x000a0;mL solvent consumption) versus workflow III (20&#x000a0;min analysis time, 95&#x000a0;mL solvent consumption); after workflow I, some sample volumes were slightly reduced; ID assignment in ESM Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> (same as Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), but overspray of steviol and isosteviol on S1&#x02013;S4 (1&#x02013;6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/band, marked*), and exemplarily as proof, on ID 3 (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/band); detection at white light illumination (Vis) and UV 366&#x000a0;nm (FLD) after anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="216_2020_2618_Fig7_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par50">The immersion of cut plates was associated with special effort when using an automated immersion device due to the insufficient immersion of the reduced plate height into the liquid level. Piezoelectric spraying was newly applied and found highly advantageous for reagent application on cut plates. Both plate parts were simply put together and piezoelectrically sprayed with the anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent.</p><p id="Par51">Workflow I (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) is recommended for the 2-step separation because it is the most efficient procedure with regard to analysis time (20&#x000a0;min) and solvent consumption (10&#x000a0;mL). The impurity study is processed. However, there are further options to achieve a satisfying band shape under such circumstances. For workflow II (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), the development was first performed with <italic>n</italic>-hexane-ethyl acetate-glacial acetic acid (7:3:1) up to 85&#x000a0;mm for separation of steviol (<italic>hR</italic><sub>F</sub> 80) and isosteviol (<italic>hR</italic><sub>F</sub> 87), and secondly with acetonitrile-water (4:1) up to 60&#x000a0;mm for separation of steviol glycosides. The separation required only 14&#x000a0;mL mobile phase solvents, but took almost 1&#x000a0;h. For workflow III, the development was faster (20&#x000a0;min) but consumed a higher solvent volume (95&#x000a0;mL). The sample&#x000a0;solutions were applied at a higher position on the HPTLC plate and developed with a higher volume of the apolar mobile phase for separation of steviol and isosteviol (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12</xref>). Then, the chromatogram was cut at 70&#x000a0;mm and the lower larger plate part was turned by 180&#x000b0;. Thus, the previous application line still containing the steviol glycosides (now positioned at 10&#x000a0;mm) was developed with the polar mobile phase for separation of the steviol glycosides. Due to the high flexibility of the HPTLC technique, there are always more options to circumvent or solve a problem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions and outlook</title><p id="Par52">A HI-HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD method was developed and exemplarily applied to <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf extracts and 20 different food products. As shown, it was not only robust with regard to the different matrices but also powerful enough to provide further information in questionable cases. In a straightforward manner, the method was optionally combinable with HRMS or other derivatization reagents or bioassays. This offered a high degree of flexibility to solve the respective analytical issue. It was demonstrated to be suited as a fast screening, but can also be combined with HRMS for confirmation or quantification. The multi-imaging provided different chemical, biochemical, and biological profiles that delivered comprehensive information on bioactive components in <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf extracts. In contrast to the 19 different bioactive compounds found in the more natural leaf extracts, most activities were not existent for the steviol glycosides. This revealed that <italic>Stevia</italic> leaves may provide health benefits via subtle impact on several metabolic pathways and thus homeostasis, in contrast to the highly sweet, but otherwise poorly active steviol glycosides.</p><p id="Par53">This bioanalytical tool closes a major gap in the current analytical toolbox. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, it can better illustrate and evaluate the pros and cons that originate from multipotent multicomponent botanical mixtures. Exploiting a minimalistic sample preparation, multi-imaging and non-targeted bioprofiling, any product change, falsification, or adulteration is figured out faster compared with most less flexible status quo methods. Are we analytically on the right track? Do the mainstream techniques allow for a cost-efficient bioanalytical screening of complex food? Do we dare to ask the right questions? Do we need information on bioactive unknown unknowns (major portion of features/compounds is unidentified)? Can we discover unknown trace compounds of high activity potential with the given&#x000a0;status quo methods? In particular, the bioprofiling substantially contributes to solve the daunting challenge of food safety along the global product chain. It directly points to active compounds that matter, which should be of interest for food control and safety, but are currently out of the focus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
