This study aimed to investigate the effects of LPS on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEEC) from whole transcriptome with a special focus on genes involved in embryo-maternal interactions. Following <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, bEEC from three cows were exposed to 0, 2, and 8 &#x003bc;g/mL LPS for 24h. RNA samples extracted at 0 and 24 hours were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). At 24h, 2035 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between controls and samples treated with 2 &#x003bc;g/mL LPS. Gene ontology analysis showed that over-expressed DEGs were associated to immune response, response to stress and external stimuli, catalytic activity, and cell cycle. Genes associated with cell membrane and cell adhesion pathways were under-expressed. LPS induced changes in expression of specific genes related to embryo-maternal interactions including under-expression of eight members of the cadherin superfamily, over-expression of six members of the mucin family, and differential expression of a large set of genes binding the above molecules and of more than 20 transcripts coding for cytokines and their receptors. Type I interferon-&#x003c4; dependent genes were also over-expressed. From a sub-set of 19 genes, (biological replicates of bEEC from cows taken at time 6 (n = 3), 24 (n = 6) and 48 hours (n = 3), and 2 technical replicates per sample) differential gene expression was confirmed by RT<sup>2</sup>-qPCR (r<sup>2</sup> between fold changes at 24 hours by RT<sup>2</sup>-qPCR and RNA-seq = 0.97). These results indicate that LPS affects the function of bEEC in many ways by differential transcription, glycolytic metabolism and oxidative stress. Many transcriptomic signatures related to implantation and embryo maternal interactions were strongly affected by LPS. These results pave the way for further studies to investigate the duration of these changes and their possible impact on endometrial function and fertility.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>FORMAS</institution></funding-source><award-id>(Grant 2015-888)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Humblot</surname><given-names>Patrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>FP7 EU project &#x0201c;PROLIFIC&#x0201d;</institution></funding-source><award-id>Grant KBBE 311776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Humblot</surname><given-names>Patrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Rajamangala University of Technology Srivijaya (RMUSTSV), Thailand.&#x0201d;</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chanrot</surname><given-names>Metasu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was performed with the financial support from the FP7 EU project &#x0201c;PROLIFIC&#x0201d; (Grant KBBE 311776) to PH and FORMAS (Grant 2015-888) to PH and by a grant from Rajamangala University of Technology Srivijaya (RMUSTSV), Thailand to MC.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Our RNAseq raw data were uploaded to Nucleotide Sequence Database (ENA) with the accession number PRJEB34011.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Our RNAseq raw data were uploaded to Nucleotide Sequence Database (ENA) with the accession number PRJEB34011.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Escherichia coli (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) is commonly associated with uterine infection in post-partum cows [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), at the outer membrane of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and other Gram-negative bacteria, is one of the most powerful bacterial virulence factors triggering inflammation of the endometrium [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, LPS has been reported to induce implantation failure, and pregnancy losses in the human species [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. LPS binding to toll-like receptors trigger pathways activating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, in different cell models including epithelial cells from different species, oxidative stress and glycolysis associated also to increased proliferation have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cytokines including growth factors and their corresponding receptors expressed on endometrial cells play an important role in the processes regulating embryonic development, and in the interactions between the embryo and maternal cells, especially at time of implantation [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Successful implantation is the result of a very precise balance between cytokines which are necessary to the induction of uterine remodeling (such as LIF, IL-6, IL-17) and cytokines such as TGF&#x003b2;, IL-10, IL-27, G-CSF limiting the inflammatory processes and driving the response of the maternal endometrium to embryo towards immune-tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In human and mice, it has been shown that other molecules such as Galectin-1 (Gal-1) are involved in the regulation of the differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are key effectors in orientating the innate immune response mechanisms towards immune-tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In ruminants, due to essential for maternal recognition of pregnancy and maintenance, a special attention has been paid to IFN-&#x003c4; [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The data obtained here provide additional results on gene expression changes as a complement to former published information on the phenotypic response in terms of proliferation and survival of cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and on the changes in proteomic profiles induced by LPS [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in the same cell model. The present results show a wide range of responses of these cells to LPS, confirming the high pro-inflammatory role of this molecule and former information obtained on the corresponding pathways in endometrial cells and other types of epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, we provide novel information regarding the impact of LPS on sets of specific genes related to embyromaternal interactions and corresponding pathways which were here specifically scrutinized. Although incomplete due to the nature of this model based on a single cell type, these results contribute to understand the potential role of LPS on persistence of inflammation in the endometrium and its possible unfavorable effects on endometrial function possibly impairing fertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Isolation of bovine endometrial epithelial cells (EEC)</title><p>The uterine horns from three Swedish Red Breed (SRB) cows were collected from slaughterhouse (L&#x000f6;vsta SLU, Uppsala, Sweden). Endometrial epithelial cells were separated then cultured according to procedures previously described [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Within one hour after slaughter, the endometrium was dissected into 5&#x02013;6 cm long and 4&#x02013;5 mm depth pieces. Tissue pieces were incubated for two hours at 39&#x000b0;C with collagenase IV (C5138, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and hyaluronidase (250 U/mL) (H3506, Sigma) in PBS containing 2% BSA (Sigma). The suspension was then filtered through 250 &#x003bc;m gauze to remove mucus and undigested tissue. The filtrate was then passed through a 40 &#x003bc;m nylon sieve, which allowed the fibroblasts and blood cells to pass through while epithelial cells were retained. Epithelial cells were collected from the filter by backwashing with 30 mL PBS. Cells were centrifuged at 170 &#x000d7;g for six minutes and the pellet re-suspended in three mL of PBS. Pellets were dispersed into a single cell suspension by passing through a fine gauge needle (20G). Cells were then cultured in F-12 medium (Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium, D6434, Sigma) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.5% Liquid Media Supplement (ITS), and gentamycin (5 &#x003bc;g/mL) and nystatin (100 U/mL). Cells were seeded into a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> ventilation flask. Cell cultures were kept in a water-jacked incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 39&#x000b0;C. Medium was changed every 1&#x02013;2 days. Sub-cultivations were performed when epithelial cells attained 80 to 90% confluence [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The purity of bovine endometrial epithelial cell (bEEC) culture was estimated by morphological observation following three to five passages. Potential residual contamination of fibroblasts was eliminated between each passage by detaching with 3 mL tryp<sup>LETM</sup> express (Gibco 12605) for two min at 39&#x000b0;C, and aspiration of the supernatant. Cells retained in the bottom were then viewed under the microscope to determine the presence of fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

that the treatment did not alter cell viability and stimulated the proliferation of cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite that the stimulation of proliferation was higher with 8 &#x003bc;g/mL LPS at 72 h after treatment, significant differences in gene expression at 24 hours after treatment between 2 and 8 &#x003bc;g/mL LPS were not observed. In addition, we found numerous changes in protein expression 72 hours after challenge indicating strong alterations of several cell functions [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The changes included de-regulation of proteins related to translation, metabolism, glycolysis and related oxidative stress which were over-expressed and down regulation of proteins related to cell structure and adhesion and specific proteins involved in immune-tolerance (such as GAL-1 and TGF&#x003b2;). Samples from the present experiment were taken at an earlier time than for the proteomic experiment to detect changes in mRNA expression. The pathway analysis of the present study, showing differential gene expression leading to a stimulation of cell metabolism, accompanied by activation of the glycolytic and oxidative stress pathways was fully consistent with the changes observed from our proteomic analysis [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The down regulation of cell structure and cell adhesion pathways was also observed from both proteomics [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the present RNA sequencing results. When compared to other studies made in the cow [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], human [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and mouse [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] endometrium, our results fully confirm that a high number of differentially expressed genes relates to immune response, response to infection and inflammation and also to cell metabolism and oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Former studies in the cow, reported changes in genes involved in embryo maternal interaction, notably interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes <italic>RSAD2</italic>, <italic>MX2</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic>, <italic>ISG15</italic>, <italic>BST2;</italic> as well as several molecules involved in the intracellular recognition of pathogens or their ligands, including <italic>IFIH1</italic>, <italic>MDA5</italic>, <italic>DEXH Asp-Glu-X-His box polypeptide 58 (DHX58)</italic>, and up-regulation of a large number of chemokines such as <italic>IL8</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, <italic>CCL20</italic>, <italic>CXCL2</italic>, <italic>CXCL3</italic>, <italic>CSCL10</italic>, <italic>CXCL11</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, <italic>CCL11</italic>, and <italic>CCL20</italic>.

In addition, gene changes in <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP3</italic>, and <italic>MMP13</italic> in response to LPS were also reported [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>We confirm here changes in expression for most/all these genes. However, results from this data set enlarge the list of gene expression changes corresponding to specific key molecules for embryo-maternal interaction and implantation. As cows previously infected by gram negative bacteria present infertility and high culling rate after infection [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] the significance of the above changes in relation with persistent inflammation and establishment of pregnancy will be discussed.</p><p>Our data indicate that epithelial cells are highly sensitive to LPS and activate strongly the corresponding inflammatory pathways. In particular, the toll-like receptor-signaling pathway was significantly affected by LPS treatment, and 19 of the over-expressed DEGs were associated with this pathway including many genes encoding cytokines and chemokines. This is in full agreement with former information showing that LPS provokes the activation of the host&#x02019;s innate immune response by increasing TLR4- and MyD88-dependent signaling [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines following binding of TLR4 [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] The toll-like receptor signaling pathway activates key molecules to drive immune-related responses towards infectious agents and attracts immune cells by the site of infection [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In a first step, this represents one of the main defense mechanisms of the mucosal epithelium. It has also been suggested that the increased expression of cytokine and chemokine genes leads to a persistent presence of immune cells in the endometrium possibly altering implantation [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Chemokines can promote or inhibit human trophoblast cell migration and invasion in first-trimester placenta [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For instance, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) has pleiotropic effects on cell growth, inflammation and innate immunity in the endometrium and is strongly involved in embryo development and implantation [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These effects can be either beneficial or detrimental and high concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; has been reported to be the source of implantation failures and pregnancy loss [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Chemokines like CXCL1 and CXCL6 contribute to neutrophil recruitment and are associated with pathways involved in inflammation and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>From this bEEC <italic>in vitro</italic> model, despite the fact that cells were exposed to relatively low dosages of LPS [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and for a short time when compared to the in vivo situation, we observed very strong changes in expression of both cytokines and chemokines. The duration of these changes in gene expression should be evaluated further from <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Such changes may alter the uterine environment and may not be favorable to the transit of spermatozoa and their survival through the female genital tract [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, due to the very delicate immune balance necessary for the establishment of pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and to the very high fold change for some of the genes, it may be speculated that in cows which have been exposed to endometritis, changes in gene expression may also contribute to alter embryo-maternal relationships after infection has disappeared [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Undiagnosed persistent inflammation may also represent a limitation in case of embryo transfer.</p><p>Complementary to the above mechanisms related to infection and associated immune response, this study shows that many molecules specifically related to embryo development and implantation are strongly de-regulated by LPS. It has been established for a long time that in ruminants, Interferon-&#x003c4; (IFNT) is the main signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy which prevents prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; induced luteolysis [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This molecule is also critical for implantation by regulating the function of a large number of genes called IFNT-induced genes, which are regulated through the STAT-dependent signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which is activated at the beginning of pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Activation of this pathway is driven by the developing embryo through secretion of IFNT which induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1, -2 and -3 [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition, leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF)-dependent STAT activation is critical for embryo-endometrial interaction and trophoblast invasion [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. LIF is highly expressed in mouse uterus during receptivity phase and essential for embryo implantation [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Without LIF, the downstream signal transduction pathways may be crippled [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Decreased expression or complete lack of LIF production is linked to implantation failure [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Contrary to what was reported above, the present experiment shows that after a short exposure of endometrial cells to LPS, both <italic>LIF</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> genes exhibited a strong increase in mRNA expression at 6 hours post LPS. Despite the amplitude of differential expression for these genes decreased with time, <italic>LIF</italic> mRNA remained strongly overexpressed by 48 hours and many downstream genes such as <italic>MUC1</italic>, <italic>MUC13</italic>, <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP7</italic> and <italic>MMP13 w</italic>ere shown to be strongly over-expressed at 48 hours. As reported above for the immune response, these results indicate that it would be useful to study the duration of these changes and their amplitude, and compare them with what is happening in response to a living embryo at the beginning of pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The LPS-induced changes, if persistent, may also disturb responses of the endometrial cells to IFNT and possibly impair the success of implantation.</p><p>In addition to those referred above, our results suggest that LPS activates mechanisms altering specifically cell structure and cell adhesion properties of endometrial epithelial cells which could also be unfavorable to subsequent implantation. Successful embryo implantation requires a subtle regulation of tissue remodeling by adhesion molecules (cadherins, integrins, selectins, and MMPs) [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The members of the cadherin superfamily mediate cell-cell interactions though calcium binding, and any possible changes could impair implantation [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Our results clearly show that all DEGs encoding proteins involved in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton which are important for the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors were down-regulated after LPS challenge. Furthermore, MMPs and its tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are enzymes that mediate immune response to infection, and are involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during pregnancy and parturition [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Their activities must be well balanced for successful implantation. Decreased expression of MMP2 and TIMP3 were detected in the endometrium of women experiencing implantation failure [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The significance of such changes should be more documented from further functional studies in the cow. However, since TIMP3 exerts a function as the major modulator of extracellular matrix degradation during implantation [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], the LPS-induced down-regulation of <italic>TIMP3</italic> mRNA, as observed here may be unfavorable to interactions between the conceptus and the endometrium.</p><p>We also found that a group of genes coding for proteins belonging to the galectin (Gal) family was de-regulated by LPS suggesting that LPS may alter early embryo&#x02013;maternal communication [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that Gal-1, 3 and 9 play a crucial role in the cell proliferation, adhesion processes, and modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, pro-inflammation and/or regulation of immunosuppressive activity. Gal-1 is required for establishing an immune-privileged local environment for implantation and early fetal development which relates especially from its immunosuppressive activities and key role for maternal-fetal tolerance as documented in humans and rodents [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Gal-1 is up-regulated during normal pregnancy and expressed also in human preimplantation embryos. This protein stimulates FOXP3 which controls the differentiation of T naive cells into T regulatory cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Gal-1 also positively regulates the expression of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) which inhibits NK cells and modulates cytokine secretion to control trophoblast cell invasion and to maintain a local immunotolerance during implantation [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Probably as the result of the above, low expression in the endometrium has been associated with an increased frequency of early pregnancy failures and miscarriages [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222081.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. It has been reported that Gal-1 was present in the bovine endometrium, mainly in the lamina propria [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], but the exact roles of Gal-1 and how it regulates <italic>BOLA</italic> gene expression during pregnancy is not known in this species. The decreased expression of Gal-1 mRNA as observed here corroborates the decreased expression of Gal-1 protein following LPS challenge [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which has been observed at a later stage.</p><p>In the cow, Gal-3 has been identified to be expressed in the uterus, cervix, oviduct, atretic follicles, and regressing corpus luteum [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Gal-3 down-regulation may be involved in the changes observed in cell adhesion as these proteins bind to a large set of molecules including integrins, laminin and fibronectin [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Gal-9 is expressed in all uterine cell types, including endometrial epithelia and endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Over-expression of Gal-9 associated with the increase of expression of many genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines suggest that Gal-9 may control positively the production of these molecules in the absence of immune cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned above for other signals, the correlation of the length of the changes in galectins would be useful to evaluate the duration of possible alterations in endometrial function.</p><p>In this study, the expression of the <italic>PTHLH</italic> gene encoding parathyroid hormone-like hormone, presented the most significantly decreased expression level following exposure to LPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222081.s010">S9 Table</xref>). PTHLH has been localized in the cyclic endometrium in both the glandular and stromal compartments [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and exerts multiple biological functions in both normal and pathological conditions. A recent study showed that significantly decreased blastocyst formation rate of Pthlh-depleted embryos, and this effect can be overturned by injection of recombinant PTHLH [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent signaling activates PTHLH expression by increasing transcription from the P3 promoter through a synergistic interaction of the transcription factors Smad3 and Ets1 [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], and p38 MAPK-dependent signaling controls PTHLH expression in metastatic colon cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Few studies have investigated the characteristics of its expression following LPS exposure [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], however, the strong under expression observed here is very consistent with the up-stream under expression of TGF-&#x003b2; both contributing to impairments of cell adhesion processes.</p><p>Finally, the changes observed in genes susceptible to influence the methylation and acetylation profiles of bEECs suggest that LPS may globally induce lower methylation due to under- expression of a set of methyl transferases concomitant with effects on MBD4 which binds DNMTs to DNA. On the contrary, acetylation may be maintained through under-expression of a set of histone deacetylases and over-expression of numerous acetyl transferases. These results are consistent previous results showing that bacterial infections and viral infections induces de-methylation changes in host cells [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] and with the overall methylation patterns observed from Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0222081.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The high number of DEGs and multiple pathways affected by LPS observed in this study confirms that this molecule affects in a complex manner multiple functions of endometrial epithelial cells. Changes in proliferation, general metabolism, glycolysis, oxidative stress and immune response have been extensively described in the literature. The present study gives more insight in the way LPS affects specifically key molecules and pathways involved in embryo-maternal interactions and immuno-tolerance.</p><p>These results indicate clearly that most cellular events necessary at time of implantation for the establishment of a successful crosstalk between the endometrium and the developing embryo are perturbed. In addition, changes in expression for genes that control methylation may be the cause of long term consequences of previous infection on uterine function. These findings provide new insights regarding the mechanisms by which LPS and induced inflammation may alter uterine receptivity. This information showing a multiplicity of differential gene expression patterns in response to LPS treatment suggest to perform additional studies to evaluate further, the persistence of those changes and their functional impact on fertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0222081.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Overrepresented KEGG pathways in relation with immune response.</title><p>A.
