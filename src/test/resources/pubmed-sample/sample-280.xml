Humans are generally risk averse when faced with a choice between safe and risky gains [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Non-human animals ranging from insects to primates also sometimes exhibit risk aversion for amounts of food reward [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] but are instead risk seeking when faced with variable delays [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or negative energy budgets ([<xref rid="RSBL20140451C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but see [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Moreover, chimpanzees (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and pigeons (<italic>Columba livia</italic>) [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSBL20140451C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] can even be risk seeking for amounts of food reward. Here, we attempt to reconcile these conflicting findings by testing pigeons and humans in formally identical procedures.</p><p>One prominent difference in how risky choice is assessed in humans and non-human animals is the manner in which information is conveyed [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whereas humans are typically presented with described odds, animals, by necessity, are tested through repeated experience with the rewards. This experience-based choice more closely resembles the natural environments of animals and the ancestral environment for humans. Recent research has revealed that this information format influences human risky choice and can even reverse risk preferences [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSBL20140451C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>For example, Hayden &#x00026; Platt [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] tested humans in a task designed to closely follow risky-choice experiments in monkeys [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Instead of the typical one-shot described choices [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], they gave humans multiple trials to learn the outcomes. Under these conditions, humans did not show consistent risk aversion, but rather showed a win&#x02013;stay, lose&#x02013;shift strategy similar to monkeys [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we took the opposite strategy and transformed an experimental protocol used for evaluating learned decisions in humans [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] into a pigeon foraging analogue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSBL20140451F1">figure 1</xref>). Individuals of both species learned about four options: two that led to <italic>high-value</italic> rewards and two that led to <italic>low-value</italic> rewards. For each reward level (high or low), one <italic>safe</italic> option yielded a guaranteed fixed reward, and one <italic>risky</italic> option yielded a 50/50 chance of a better or worse reward. The expected values for the safe and risky options were matched within each reward level.

(Online version in colour.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rsbl20140451-g1"/></fig></p><p>The risk-sensitive foraging literature suggests that risk sensitivity is determined by the coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation/mean) of the reward amount [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our experiment, variance was fixed across reward levels, making the CV smaller for the decisions with high-value rewards. Therefore, individuals should show lower risk sensitivity for these high-value decisions than for the low-value decisions. By contrast, prior behavioural results with humans suggest that the extreme outcomes (highest and lowest rewards) are overweighted in decisions from experience [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As a result, more risk seeking should be observed in high-value decisions than low-value decisions.</p><p>Thus, both the risk-sensitive foraging literature and the human risky-choice literature lead us to predict an effect of reward value on risky choice, but the foraging literature predicts an effect on risk sensitivity, whereas the human literature predicts an effect on risk preference. In either case, our key prediction is that using choice protocols where all consequences are learned from experience should lead to similar choice patterns across species.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and method</title><sec id="s2a"><label>(a)</label><title>Subjects</title><p>Six pigeons (<italic>C. livia</italic>) were housed individually and kept at 85% of ad libitum weight through post-session feeding.

The high-value safe door always yielded 60 points, and the high-value risky door yielded either 40 or 80 points with a 50/50 chance.

This convergence suggests a phylogenetic generality of the behavioural mechanisms underlying risky choice. The results are consistent with the potential overweighting of the biggest and smallest rewards in the context in choice [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this case, overweighting the biggest loss (0 points or no food) in low-value decisions produces risk aversion, and overweighting the biggest gain (80 points or four food cups) in high-value decisions produces more risk seeking. This overweighting could be implemented through many different theoretical mechanisms, including the distortion of an internal utility function [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or changes in the samples used for relative comparisons [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These results do not support the CV hypothesis [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which predicts lower risk sensitivity for the high-value decisions than the low-value decisions. There were no reliable differences in risk sensitivity between high- and low-value decisions for either species.</p><p>These results corroborate and extend previous studies showing that risky choice in humans was influenced by the most extreme rewards in the decision context. Notably, choice between any particular safe and risky option depended on the other choices in the context. If the risky option led to the best possible outcome, people were more risk seeking and if it led to the worst outcome in the context, people were risk averse [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The risk preferences also correlated with a bias towards better remembering the most extreme outcomes [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The results presented here suggest that, similar to humans, pigeons also overweight the most extreme outcomes in a decision context.</p><p>Several alternative explanations for these results can also be ruled out. For both the high- and low-value decisions, the energy budget was equivalent as both decisions occurred during the same session and followed large or small rewards equally often. Thus, a change in local energy budget cannot explain these results. Alternatively, the risk aversion observed in the low-value case could possibly be ascribed to a strong aversion to the zero reward, rather than an aversion to the extreme value. This aversion, however, does not explain the trend towards risk seeking observed with the high-value rewards. Moreover, in previous work with humans, we found the same pattern of risky choice when all reward values were shifted so that there was no zero reward [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>These results build on a growing literature, showing that, despite superficial differences, risky choice in humans and other animals can be made similar [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSBL20140451C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The key factor appears to be use of experience-based choice procedures for humans that match those typically used in animal studies [<xref rid="RSBL20140451C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here, through such a well-matched procedure, we identified a shared behavioural process&#x02014;the overweighting of extreme outcomes&#x02014;which drives risky choice with experienced rewards.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title/><p>Procedures were approved by University of Alberta ethics committees.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Data accessibility</title><p>Additional details are available in the electronic supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Funding statement</title><p>This study was financially supported by the <funding-source>Alberta Gambling Research Institute</funding-source> (AGRI) and <funding-source>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council</funding-source> (NSERC) of Canada.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary Methods</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="rsbl20140451supp1.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e562" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="RSBL20140451C1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kahneman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Tversky</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>
