We sought to determine whether the human urinary tract also is home to viral communities whose membership might reflect urinary tract health status. We recruited and sampled urine from 20 subjects, 10 subjects with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and 10 without UTIs, and found viral communities in the urine of each subject group. Most of the identifiable viruses were bacteriophage, but eukaryotic viruses also were identified in all subjects. We found reads from human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in 95% of the subjects studied, but none were found to be high-risk genotypes that are associated with cervical and rectal cancers. We verified the presence of some HPV genotypes by quantitative PCR. Some of the HPV genotypes identified were homologous to relatively novel and uncharacterized viruses that previously have been detected on skin in association with cancerous lesions, while others may be associated with anal and genital warts. On a community level, there was no association between the membership or diversity of viral communities based on urinary tract health status. While more data are still needed, detection of HPVs as members of the human urinary virome using viral metagenomics represents a non-invasive technique that could augment current screening techniques to detect low-risk HPVs in the genitourinary tracts of humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human microbiome</kwd><kwd>urinary tract infections</kwd><kwd>virome</kwd><kwd>virobiota</kwd><kwd>HPV</kwd><kwd>papillomavirus</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="9188"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The presence of microbes inhabiting the human urinary tract has generally been associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs), but recent studies have demonstrated that the urine has its own unique microbiota even in the absence of UTIs (Nelson et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Siddiqui et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wolfe et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Many of these microbiota may not be culturable using conventional culture techniques, but the presence of a diverse microbiota in human urine has highlighted the need to understand whether there is a role for these communities of microbes in urinary tract health or disease. Healthy female urinary microbiota often include organisms also identified in the vagina (Fouts et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wolfe et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hilt et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), while healthy male microbiota may resemble the vagina, gut, and skin (Nelson et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Dong et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Fouts et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). There are numerous lower urinary tract symptoms that often do not have known infectious etiologies, so understanding whether these conditions may be influenced by disturbances to the urinary microbiota is of substantial interest.</p><p>UTIs are among the most common urological disorders in the health care settings, and are diagnosed using a combination of both symptoms and culture tests. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is recognized as the most common etiological agent of UTI, responsible for more than 80% of reported cases in females (Foxman and Brown, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), but there are numerous other microbes capable of causing UTIs (Stamm, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Pour et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Volkow-Fernandez et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). While a threshold concentration of 10<sup>3</sup> Colony Forming Units (CFU) per ml of urine accompanied with lower urinary tract symptoms is required for a UTI diagnosis, there are some pathogens that are not detected by standard microbiological culture techniques (Rubin et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Disturbances to the urinary tract microbiota can be recognized in the presence of pathogens (Pearce et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), but it is not yet clear how long it takes for the urinary tract to recover its normal microbiota after both pathogen-mediated disturbances and antibiotic therapy.</p><p>While there is a substantial cellular microbiota indigenous to the human urinary tract, little is known about viruses. There are viral pathogens of the human urinary tract, such as adenovirus (Echavarria et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Echavarria, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and BK virus (Shinohara et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Paduch, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Egli et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), but these viruses generally are only pathogenic in subjects with compromised immune systems. There are other viruses such as Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) that inhabit human genital and rectal areas, and have previously also been found in urine (Pathak et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Because HPVs can be associated with both warts and cancer in humans (Wylie et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), the diagnosis of its presence and particular subtypes associated with infection can be critical in the care of individual subjects who are infected. Previous studies have demonstrated that robust communities of cellular microbiota on human body surfaces are generally accompanied by communities of viruses. There are vast communities of viruses that inhabit the human oral cavity (Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the human gut (Minot et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), the human respiratory tract (Willner et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and human skin (Foulongne et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), which suggests that there likely would be communities of viruses that also are indigenous to the human urinary tract. One prior study identified a unique viral community in the subgingival crevice of individuals with severe periodontal disease (Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which suggests that viruses could play a role in health and disease. There are many subjects with lower urinary tract symptoms, with no known cellular microbial etiologies, yet viral communities in these subjects are completely unexplored (Enerly et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>We sought to decipher whether there is a population of viruses indigenous to the human urinary tract and whether urine viral community membership may be affected by urinary tract health status. Our goals were to: (1) identify and quantify viral populations in human urine, (2) determine whether trends in urine bacterial biota might also be reflected in the virobiota of urine, (3) elucidate whether the presence of urinary pathogens affects viral community membership, (4) decipher whether human viruses populate the urinary tract, or whether viruses encountered are primarily bacteriophage, and (5) characterize differences between the virobiota of the male and female urinary tracts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Human subjects and culture conditions</title><p>Human subject involvement in this study was approved by the University of California, San Diego Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research. The study was certified as category 4 exempt, which includes research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if the information is recorded in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects. We sampled the urine from 20 human subjects, with 10 having urinary tract infections, and another 10 testing negative for UTIs. None of the female subjects had prior abnormal PAP smears and therefore had never been tested for the presence of cervical HPV. None of the male subjects had anal PAP smears and were not previously tested for HPV. No subjects reported any prior history of anal or genital warts. The diagnosis of UTI was based on the clinical laboratory standards institute definition, and includes the presence of &#x02265;10<sup>3</sup> CFU of bacteria and &#x02265;10 leukocytes per high powered field (Stamm, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). All specimens were planted on Sheep's blood agar, McConkey, and Chocolate agar plates. Each of the patients in this study was symptomatic and had at least 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml of bacteria in their urine specimens. Bacteria were identified to the species level using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry, which is a mass spectrometry technique for the identification of bacteria with sensitivity and specificity similar to that of conventional biochemical techniques (Neville et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). For the <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates, their identification also was verified by the presence of lactose fermentation and mobility to ensure that they could not be <italic>Shigella</italic> species. Urine specimens were processed within 2 h of their collection and the bacteria were identified within 24 h of their collection. All specimens from both UTI+ and UTI&#x02212; subjects had their viromes processed within 48 h of their collection. All cultures from UTI&#x02212; subjects were held for a minimum of 72 h to ensure they were truly negative. All urine specimens were stored at 4&#x000b0;C prior to processing of viromes.</p></sec><sec><title>Virome preparation and sequencing</title><p>Urine samples were processed according to our previously described protocols for processing viruses from saliva (Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Urine (1 ml) was filtered sequentially using 0.45 and 0.2 &#x003bc;m filters (VWR, Radnor, PA) and purified on a cesium chloride density gradient, with the fraction corresponding to most known bacteriophage (Murphy et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) retained. The purified virions were further purified on Amicon YM-100 protein columns (Millipore, Inc., Bellerica, MA), treated with DNase I, and their DNA purified using a Qiagen UltraSens virus kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA then was amplified using GenomiPhi V2 MDA amplification (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA), fragmented to 200&#x02013;400 bp using a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville, NJ), and libraries created using the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit. Libraries then were sequenced using 314 chips on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) (Rothberg et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) producing an average read length of approximately 206 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>Virome analysis</title><p>We trimmed the resulting reads according to modified Phred scores of 0.5 using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65 (CLC bio USA, Cambridge, MA), removed any low complexity reads (where &#x0003e;25% of the length were due to homopolymer tracts), and removed any reads with substantial length variation (&#x0003c;50 nucleotides or &#x0003e;300 nucleotides) or ambiguous characters prior to further analysis. Each virome was screened for contaminating bacterial and human nucleic acids using BLASTN analysis (E-score &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) against the Ribosomal Database Project 16S rRNA database (Cole et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and the human reference database available at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/</ext-link>. Any reads homologous to human sequences were removed prior to further analysis. GC content variation among contigs was assessed using Box and Whiskers plots created using Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redman, WA). Remaining reads were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65 based on 98% identity with a minimum of 50% read overlap, which were more stringent than criteria developed to discriminate between highly related viruses (Breitbart et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Because the shortest reads were 50 nucleotides, the minimum tolerable overlap was 25 nucleotides, and the average overlap was no less than 103 nucleotides depending on the characteristics of each virome. The consensus sequence for each contig was constructed according to majority rule, and any contigs &#x0003c;200 nucleotides or with ambiguous characters were removed prior to further analysis. Contigs were annotated using BLASTX against the NCBI Non-redundant (NR) database with an E-score cutoff value of 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. Specific viral homologs were determined by parsing BLASTX results for known viral genes including replication, structural, transposition, restriction/modification, hypothetical, and other genes previously found in viruses for which the E-score was at least 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. Each individual virome contig was annotated using this technique; however, if the best hit for any portion of the contig was to a gene with no known function, lower level hits were used as long as they had known function and still met the E-score cutoff. The annotation data were compiled for each subject and used to determine the relative proportions of assembled contigs that contained viral homologs. Analysis of shared homologs present in each virome was performed by creating custom BLAST databases for each virome, comparing each database with all other viromes using BLASTN analysis (E-score &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>). Beta diversity between viromes was determined using binary Sorensen distances, and was determined by randomly sampling 1000 contigs between viromes. Principal coordinates analysis (PCOA) was performed with the estimated distances using Qiime (Caporaso et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). Read mappings of viromes to a database of phage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phantome.org">www.phantome.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/</ext-link>) and a database of viruses (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/</ext-link>) was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65 (CLC bio USA, Cambridge, MA), and were mapped using 98% identity over a minimum of 50% of the read length. Virome sequences are available for download in the MG-RAST database (metagenomics.anl.gov/) under the project &#x0201c;UrineViromeProject,&#x0201d; or under project #9680.</p></sec><sec><title>Viral diversity</title><p>To measure alpha diversity in the viral communities, we utilized a technique termed the Homologous Virus Diversity Index (HVDI). The technique is based on finding high levels of homology amongst contigs within viromes that likely belong to the same virus but were placed into separate contigs due to the limitations of the assembly process (Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Virome reads were assembled using 98% identify over a minimum of 50% of the read length using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65 (CLC bio USA, Cambridge, MA), and the resulting contig spectra utilized as the primary input for the index. We created custom nucleotide BLAST databases for each subject that contained all their contigs. We then used BLASTN analysis to find high levels of homology (E-score &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>) between different contigs within the same subject. We accepted only high levels of homology that spanned at least 50% of the length of the shorter contig being compared. All contigs in each subject were treated as nodes and those contigs that had high homology to other contigs in the same subject were added to a network by directing edges between the nodes. After evaluating homologies among all intra-subject contigs, networks formed from directed edges/nodes were assigned to individual viruses and nodes with no associations were considered singular viruses. For each resulting network, we added the number of reads assigned to each node on the network and the combined number of reads was used to represent the relative abundance of the virus represented by that network. The relative abundances of all viruses were calculated using this technique, and a new contig spectra representing the viral population in each subject was formed. The contig spectra from each subject then were used as surrogates for population structures and input directly into the Shannon Index (Gotelli and Colwell, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) to estimate diversity. We also utilized the relative numbers of viral contigs created from only a single read (singleton) or from only two reads (doubleton) as input for the chao1 index (Chao, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). The results of the corrected contig spectra in each case were compared with uncorrected contig spectra, and in each case resulted in an approximate 10% reduction in diversity calculations.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>We designed primers HPV49F (GTGATTCAAATGCAAGGG) and HPV49R (TTTACAATCTCAGACCAGTG) to target HPV genotype 49 and HPV178F (TGTTTGGAAGGGATCTAGT) and HPV178R (TCATTAAAAAGCGCCAGG) to target HPV genotype 178. Primers for both genotypes were based on early gene 1 sequences. We performed quantitative PCR in 20 &#x003bc;l reactions using 10 &#x003bc;l of SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 1 &#x003bc;l of template viral DNA (10 ng/&#x003bc;l), 7 &#x003bc;l of ultrapure water, and 1 &#x003bc;l (0.5 pmol) of each of the forward and reverse primers. The following cycling parameters were used: an initial denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s, annealing at 54&#x000b0;C for 15 s, and final extension at 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min on an Eppendorf Mastercycler Realplex2. Each reaction was run in triplicate and results were only considered positive if each replicate had a <italic>Ct</italic>-value =35 with a product at the expected size. One of the products was verified by Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplicon and produced a product identical to the reads matching HPV already found.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of 16S rRNA</title><p>Genomic DNA was prepared from the urine of each subject and time point using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA MINI kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Each sample was subjected to a bead beating step prior to nucleic acid extraction using Lysing Matrix-B (MP Bio, Santa Ana, CA). We amplified the bacterial 16S rRNA V3 hypervariable region using the forward primer 341F (CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG) fused with the Ion Torrent Adaptor A sequence and one of 23 unique 10 base pair barcodes, and reverse primer 514R (ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) fused with the Ion Torrent Adaptor P1 from the urine of each subject (Whiteley et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). PCR reactions were performed using Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with the following cycling parameters: 94&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 53&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and a final elongation step of 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Resulting amplicons were purified on a 2% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Amplicons were further purified with Ampure beads (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA), and molar equivalents were determined for each sample using a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were pooled into equimolar proportions and sequenced on 314 chips using an Ion Torrent PGM according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) (Rothberg et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Resulting sequence reads were removed from the analysis if they were &#x0003c;130 nucleotide, had any barcode or primer errors, contained any ambiguous characters, or contained any stretch of &#x0003e;6 homopolymers. Sequences were assigned to their respective samples based on their 10 nucleotide barcode sequence, and were analyzed further using the Qiime pipeline (Caporaso et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). Briefly, representative OTUs from each set were chosen at a minimum sequence identity of 97% using UClust (Edgar, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and aligned using PyNast (Caporaso et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>) against the Greengenes database (Desantis et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Multiple alignments then were used to create phylogenies using FastTree (Li and Godzik, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and taxonomy was assigned to each OTU using the RDP classifier (Wang et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Price et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). PCOA was performed based on Beta Diversity using weighted Unifrac distances (Lozupone et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Alpha diversity based on the Shannon Index and the chao1 index also were performed using the Qiime pipeline. Differences in the relative abundances of taxa between subject groups were determined using student's <italic>t</italic>-test. 16S rRNA sequences are available for download in the MG-RAST database (metagenomics.anl.gov/) under the project &#x0201c;UrineViromeProject,&#x0201d; or under project #9680.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To assess whether viromes had significant overlap between subjects and subject groups, we performed a permutation test based on resampling (10,000 iteration) (Robles-Sikisaka et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Naidu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We simulated the distribution of the fraction of shared virome homologs from two different time points within individual subjects that were randomly chosen across all time points. For each set, we computed the summed fraction of shared homologs using 1000 random contigs between randomly chosen individual time points within different subjects, and from these computed an empirical null distribution of our statistic of interest (the fraction of shared homologs). The simulated statistics within each subject group were referred to the null distribution of inter-group comparisons, and the <italic>p</italic>-value was computed as the fraction of times the simulated statistic for the each exceeded the observed statistic. An identical analysis was performed at the OTU level for the16S rRNA taxonomic assignments. For analysis of sex specific characteristics within the viromes, a randomly chosen subject and time point from the male sex was compared with a randomly chosen subject and time from the female sex to determine the null distribution of fraction of shared contigs based on opposite sexes. We then estimated the fraction of shared homologs from randomly chosen subjects and time points within each sex and compared with the empirical null distribution from simulated inter-sex values. We estimated the <italic>p</italic>-value based on the fraction of times the intra-sex statistic exceeded that for the observed statistic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Human subject characteristics</title><p>We recruited 20 human subjects, 10 that were diagnosed with UTIs and 10 with negative urine cultures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

microscopy</title><p>Because viral communities in human urine have not previously been characterized, we first utilized epifluorescence microscopy to determine whether viral communities were present and to estimate their concentrations. We found that there were approximately 10<sup>7</sup> virus-like particles (VLPs) per ml of urine present in each of the subjects in this study (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">1</xref>). No differences in VLP concentrations were observed between subjects with or without UTIs. Comparatively, there generally are 10<sup>8</sup> VLPs per ml of saliva (Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> VLPs per ml of human feces (Haynes and Rohwer, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The relatively low concentrations of viruses in urine may reflect the lower relative abundance of the microbiota in the human urinary tract when compared to the oral cavity and the gut. These data suggest that there are communities of viruses present in the human urinary tract whose relative abundance are not affected by the presence of urinary pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>Urine virome sequence characteristics</title><p>We isolated viral communities from the urine of our cohort using our previously described methods (Robles-Sikisaka et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Naidu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We sequenced a total of 14,542,349 reads, 6,734,864 from subjects with UTIs and 7,807,485 from subjects without UTIs (Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>). The mean number of reads per subject was 727,117, with a mean length of 206 nucleotides, and a mean GC content of 40.1%. Viromes were screened for contaminating cellular DNA by BLASTN (E-score &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) analyses against the Ribosomal Database Project 16S rRNA database (Cole et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and a Human Reference Genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/</ext-link>). None of the viromes had identifiable 16S rRNA, and 0.42% of the reads were homologous to human DNA. Reads homologous to human DNA were removed prior to further analysis. We assembled the viral reads into contigs, as the larger contigs generally result in more productive BLAST searches. We obtained an average of 2285 contigs per subject with a mean length of 1209 nucleotides and a mean GC content of 41.4%. No significant differences were observed in GC content between subjects with and without UTIs (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of human papillomaviruses (HPVs)</title><p>To decipher whether there may be individual viruses in this cohort that have high similarity to known viruses, we mapped the reads from each virome to the NCBI virus database. We found reads in both UTI+ and UTI&#x02212; subjects that matched herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, and human papillomaviruses. The HPVs were much more prevalent than any other eukaryotic viruses identified in these subjects, and many of the viromes had reads that mapped specifically across most of the genomes of the HPVs. Nineteen of the 20 (95%) subjects mapped across different HPV viromes, which included all UTI&#x02212; subjects and nine of 10 (90%) of the UTI+ subjects (Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). For subject URN2, 1.7% (14,647 reads) of the reads mapped to HPV Type 96 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and in subject URN6, 1.8% (13,948 reads) of the virome reads mapped to HPV Type 49 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Different reads from these subjects also mapped to HPV Types 92, and 121 (data not shown). In subject URP12, 3.7% (25,389 reads) of the reads mapped to HPV Type 178 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and Type 121 (data not shown). None of the subjects participating in this study had previously been diagnosed with genital warts or HPV infections, so the presence of HPV in the urine of these subjects suggests that urine may be a reasonable specimen type for screening for urogenital HPV infections. None of the females had previously had abnormal PAP smears or cervical HPV testing, but the types of HPVs identified by commercially available tests would not have identified the genotypes present in this study. To confirm the presence of some HPV types in the urine, we developed primers for HPV Types 49 and 178, as several subjects had reads that mapped specifically to these viruses. We confirmed the presence of nucleic acids matching HPV Type 49 in the urine of five of the 20 subjects (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">3</xref>), while 10% of the subjects had nucleic acids matching HPV Type 178 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Read mappings of select viromes to Human papillomaviruses (HPVs).

We found many viral reads that mapped to individual viruses, however, many only mapped to single genes often involved in viral replication. We did find some that mapped across much of the genomes of known viruses, including subject URN2 mapping to Lambda phage (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">4A</xref>), URN12 mapping to <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> phage PH15 (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">4B</xref>), URP1 mapping to <italic>E. coli</italic> phage phiV10 (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">4C</xref>), and URP2 mapping to <italic>Enterococcus</italic> phage phiFL4A (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">4D</xref>).</p><p>To further aid in deciphering the contents of the viromes, we subjected all the assembled contigs to BLASTX analysis against the NCBI NR database to identify homologous sequences. We identified numerous contigs with homologous sequences in the NR database, with most of those sequences homologous to phage. Approximately 27 percent of the contigs were homologous to known viruses, with the majority (&#x0003e;99%) representing bacteriophage (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">5</xref>). We identified contigs with homologs to viral hypothetical proteins, structural genes (head, capsid, collar, portal tail, tail fibers), restriction modification enzymes, virulence and DNA replication and integration genes (DNA polymerases, helicases, integrases, and primases) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). No significant differences were noted for the viral gene categories in association with urological health status. The high proportions of integrases identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) suggests that viruses with primarily lysogenic lifestyles were abundant in the urine viromes.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Bar graphs of the mean percentages of contigs (&#x000b1; standard error) with viral homologs in the NR database from all of the subjects</bold>.

We performed rarefaction analysis on the urinary viromes based on the Homologous Virus Diversity Index (HVDI) (Santiago-Rodriguez et al., under review) to determine the adequacy of our sequencing depth. We first calculated the HVDI based on the Shannon Index (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), which indicated that most of the diverse viruses present in the community had been sampled with relatively minimal sequencing efforts. The index calculated based on the chao1 index (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) approached asymptote for most urine samples, which corroborates that the sequencing depth for these urinary viromes was adequate.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Rarefaction analysis based on the Homologous Virus Diversity Index using the Shannon Index (A) and the chao1 Index (B) for urine viral communities</bold>.

There were no observed differences in viral community diversity based on urinary tract health status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.729); however, bacterial diversity was substantially lower in subjects with UTIs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.059), probably reflecting the relative abundance of the urinary pathogens present. That viral diversity is unaffected despite differences in bacterial biota, suggests that the urinary pathogens may not contribute substantially to overall viral diversity.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Plots of alpha diversity for urine viromes (A) and bacteria biota using 16S rRNA (B)</bold>.

We did not observe any patterns of variation in the viromes that were attributable to health status. We did, however, identify substantial differences when examining the bacterial biota, where those subjects with UTIs formed a somewhat homogenous cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). We previously have identified host-sex specific characteristics of viral communities in human saliva (Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and we tested whether there may be specific traits of the virobiota of urine that might also be host-sex specific.

The urine was once believed to constitute a sterile environment, but studies now have determined that both the male and female genitourinary tracts are home to viable bacterial communities. We hypothesized that because these communities are home to cellular microbes that they would also have indigenous communities of viruses, and this study is the first to demonstrate that urine indeed has a robust community of viruses. We found that there were approximately 10<sup>7</sup> VLPs in the urine of UTI+ and UTI&#x02212; subjects, which is an order of magnitude lower than we have previously found in human saliva (Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This may reflect differences in the relative abundances of bacteria in the urine compared to the oral cavity, as the healthy human oral cavity has many cultivable bacterial biota, while few are found in healthy urine. While many of the viruses identified were bacteriophage, as has been demonstrated in many prior studies (Breitbart et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Willner et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Reyes et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Minot et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Naidu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Robles-Sikisaka et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the presence of HPVs, which are eukaryotic viruses of the human host, suggests that human urine is a complex community with numerous different indigenous virus genotypes. Our methods to characterize viral communities generally have not identified many enveloped viruses; however, we previously have identified herpesviruses in the human oral cavity using these methods (Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), so the extent of any biases imposed by using CsCl density gradient centrifugation remains unclear. We focused our analysis of phage on the contigs assembled from the virome reads because the longer contigs allowed for more productive searches for homologous sequences, but 73% of the contigs had no identifiable homologs. The analysis of contigs did not identify many eukaryotic viruses because their relatively low abundance and probable low diversity resulted in few assembled contigs.</p><p>Many of our studies have found few eukaryotic viruses in the oral microbiome when compared to the abundance and diversity of bacteriophage (Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Robles-Sikisaka et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), suggesting that eukaryotic viruses represent a relatively small proportion of the human virome (Wylie et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In the present study we showed that HPVs comprise a portion of the urine virome in some subjects regardless of urinary tract health status. We were able to detect HPV Types in 19 of the 20 (95%) subjects studied, suggesting that HPV may be relatively common urinary virobiota. The HPV genotypes identified in this study have not been associated with high risks for cervical carcinomas, but Type 9 identified in some subjects may be associated with the development of cutaneous cancers (Andersson et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Other subjects mapped to Type 49, which has been isolated from warts in renal transplant patients (Favre et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>), and Type 178, which was isolated from skin adjacent to actinic keratosis (Johansson and Forslund, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Martin et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Our results are among the first to demonstrate the presence of these HPV genotypes in urine, presenting the opportunity to further investigate their role in urological health and diverse urological diseases. Unfortunately, the cohort of subjects studied was not ideal for characterizing potential pathogenic effects of the HPV genotypes identified because none had prior cystoscopies, culposcopies, or body imaging to document bladder or cervical pathology. Because the HPV genotypes in this study were not high risk genotypes, cystoscopies and culposcopies were not clinically indicated. Typical protocols for identifying HPV in women are based on the presence of atypical cervical pathology (Nobbenhuis et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), although primary HPV screening is now becoming more prevalent (Whitlock et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). None of the females in this study had prior abnormal PAP smears, and thus had not been tested for HPV infections. HPV diagnostic tests in clinical laboratories test for high risk genotypes (Ronco et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and would not have identified the genotypes found in this study. We believe that most of the genotypes we identified probably may be associated with genital warts, although none of the subjects previously reported having genital warts.</p><p>We characterized the human urinary virome in association with UTIs, as they are the most frequent cause of genitourinary morbidity in adults (Resnick and Older, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Foxman, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). It was somewhat surprising that the bacterial communities were significantly altered in UTI+ subjects (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), while there were no obvious differences observed in urine viral communities. In the human oral cavity, we previously found that both bacterial and viral communities were altered in subjects with moderate/severe periodontal disease (Ly et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, even when viral communities are composed mostly of bacteriophage, their membership does not necessarily reflect that of their host communities, likely due to different dynamic relationships present for different host/phage pairs (Pride et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). We believe that the lack of differences observed in UTI+ subjects may be secondary to the pathogens in these infections contributing relatively few viruses to the urinary microbiota. Further work would be necessary to decipher the contribution of phage from the pathogens in these subjects' urine microbiomes.</p><p>Similar to previous studies, there were identifiable differences in bacteria taxa in association with urological health status (Pearce et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Urine from UTI&#x02212; subjects exhibited higher bacterial diversity when compared to UTI+ subjects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These differences were not observed for viral communities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), as the pattern of BLASTX homologs in UTI+ and UTI&#x02212; subjects suggests that much of the viral community is conserved regardless of urinary tract health status (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>). Recent work has demonstrated that phage are capable of attaching to mucosal surfaces (Barr et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), so it is possible that the viruses observed in UTI+ patients could reflect viruses swept into the urine from mucosal surfaces rather than actively replicating urine viruses. Study of the urinary tract transcriptome in a cohort of UTI+ and UTI&#x02212; patients could help elucidate whether the viruses observed were actively transcribing/replicating.</p><p>The majority of the studies characterizing the urine microbiome in association with urological disorders focus on female subjects, as lower urinary tract symptoms are more common in adult females than males. Given anatomical differences in male and female urinary tracts, it is feasible to hypothesize that there would also be differences in the urinary microbiota. While not meeting statistical significance, it was interesting that there were differences identified in the bacterial biota of males and females regardless of infection status (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">6</xref>). Much of the differences may reflect the uniqueness of the female genitourinary tract, where the vagina also has its own unique microbiota (Srinivasan et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) that potentially overlaps with the urinary tract. Unlike our prior studies in the human oral cavity (Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), there was no association between host-sex and urine viral community membership (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">6</xref>). This study included only 20 subjects, which we used to screen for potential differences in virome contents between the sexes. It remains a possibility that a much larger cohort could identify differences urine viromes differences based on host sex. There appeared to be substantial inter-individual variability between the viromes of the subjects studied, however, we believe that longitudinal rather than cross-sectional studies of human viromes provide a better overview of variation observed between individuals (Abeles et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite specific HPV types being associated with low and high-health risks, just a fraction of the over 170 types have been directly implicated with disease, and many may not be detected using routine methods (Chaturvedi et al., <xref rid="B8a" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Negative results may lead to undiagnosed illnesses such as cancerous lesions; yet, negative results have also been implicated with the existence of novel HPV types that remain to be characterized and associated with diverse disease phenotypes (Johansson et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). High-throughput sequencing has been shown to successfully detect several different HPV types in HPV-negative condylomas, suggesting that it may be a reasonable approach to detect HPV in HPV-negative specimens (Johansson et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Our detection of HPV genotypes in the urine viromes of 19 subjects whom previously had not been diagnosed with HPV infections suggests that HPV colonization of the urine may be relatively common. That most viromes mapped across different HPVs, suggests the viruses in our subjects share common features with multiple known HPV genotypes. The data presented in this study indicate that viral metagenomics on urine could augment current HPV diagnostic approaches (Pathak et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.frontiersin.org/journal/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00014/abstract">http://www.frontiersin.org/journal/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00014/abstract</ext-link></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="Table1.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><media xlink:href="Presentation1.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abeles</surname><given-names>S.
