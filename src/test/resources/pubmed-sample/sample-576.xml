PHs isolated from livers that are unacceptable for transplantation have limited expansion and culture viability <italic>in vitro</italic>, in addition to rapidly deteriorating enzymatic functions. The unsuitability of immortalized hepato-carcinoma cell lines for this function has prompted studies to develop hepatocyte-like cells from alternative sources like ESC, iPS, and other stem cell types using differentiation protocols. This study describes a novel technique to produce expandable and functional hepatocyte-like cells from the fusion of an immortalized human umbilical cord blood derived cell line (E12 MLPC) to normal human primary hepatocytes. Multi-lineage progenitor cells (MLPC) comprise a small subset of mesenchymal-like cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood. MLPC are distinguishable from other mesenchymal-like cells by their extended expansion capacity (up to 80 cell doublings before senescence) and the ability to be differentiated into cells representative of endo-, meso- and ectodermal origins. Transfection of MLPC with the gene for telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) resulted in clonal cell lines that were capable of differentiation to different cellular outcomes while maintaining their functional immortality. A methodology for the development of immortalized hepatocyte-like hybrid cells by the <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion of human MLPC with normal human primary hepatocytes is reported. The resultant hybrid cells exhibited homology with hepatocytes by morphology, immunohistochemistry, urea and albumin production and gene expression. A medium that allows stable long-term expansion of hepatocyte-like fusion cells is described.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>CytoMedical Design Group, LLC (CMDG) provided funding for this study in the form of salaries for DPC and JHH.

Currently the source of primary hepatocytes for these studies are obtained from donor liver deemed unsuitable for transplantation. Limitations of the use of PH include (i) brief <italic>in vitro</italic> viability with diminishing enzymatic activity over time; and (ii) large variability between donor hepatocytes with regards to plate-ability, enzymatic activity, and toxicological reactivity. Additionally, PH have limited proliferative capacity, thus significantly reducing the availability of specific donor cells [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A stable cell line with the functionality of hepatocytes and the proliferative capacity to be greatly expanded <italic>in vitro</italic>, in combination with the potential for large-scale applications could be a useful tool for <italic>in vitro</italic> hepatocyte studies. In this study we report a novel methodology to create a long-lived cell line with the functional characteristics of PH by the <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion of an immortalized cord blood-derived stem cell with a primary human hepatocyte.</p><p>Multi-lineage stem cells (MLPC) are a primitive subset of mesenchymal-like stem cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. MLPC distinguish themselves from other mesenchymal-like cells by their ability to (i) be extensively expanded in culture (up to 80 population doublings); (ii) develop non-transformed clonal cell lines; and (iii) be differentiated to endo- and ectodermal lineages in addition to the mesodermal lineages attributed to other mesenchymal stem cell types.</p><p>Establishment of clonal cell lines from polyclonal MSC-like cells isolated from umbilical cord blood suggested that only 5&#x02013;10% of MSC-like cells could be cloned and grown to significant quantities for study. The cells that were cloned and expanded demonstrated the ability to differentiate to non-mesodermal lineages while the non-clonable cells were restricted to mesodermal lineages only. Those cells that exhibited the qualities of expansion and differentiation were named MLPC (multi-lineage progenitor cells) [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. After transfection of non-cloned MSC-like cord blood cells with the gene for hTERT and subsequent cloning, it was observed again that only 5&#x02013;10% of cells were capable of differentiation to non-mesodermal cell types. They, however, were shown to be functionally immortalized and have been grown for over 12 years, while retaining their ability to be differentiated to endo-, meso- and ectodermal outcomes. The E12 clonal cell line that demonstrated the most differential capacity, was used throughout this study.</p><p>Using a methodology initially developed for to make monoclonal antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], immortalized E12 MLPCs were fused to normal human primary hepatocytes. This resulted in the establishment of a unique hybrid cell line that was expandable and capable of continuous culture while exhibiting the phenotype and biological activity of well-differentiated and mature human hepatocytes. This methodology could provide a pathway for the development of organ-, disease- or person-specific cells and organoids for drug or therapy development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Isolation of MLPC</title><p>Umbilical cord blood was collected as part of a study to develop PrepaCyte-CB, an FDA-allowed product to de-bulk cord blood for cryo-banking and transplantation for hematopoietic reconstruction after myeloablation. IRB approval of the studies was conducted by the University of Minnesota and the Saint Louis Cord Blood Bank. The cord blood samples were collected by the American Red Cross Cord Blood Program in Saint Paul, Minnesota and Ridgeview Medical Center (Waconia, MN). Donations were collected with donor consent for research use only with no identifiers available for the donors. Collection of human umbilical cord blood was IRB approved by Quorum Review Protocol #800, March 3, 2005. MLPC were a commercially available product market by BioE from 2006&#x02013;2010.</p><p>Briefly, post-partum human cord blood was mixed at a one-to-one ratio with PrepaCyte-MSC (CMDG, LLC, Saint Paul, MN) for 30 minutes at room temperature and then allowed to sediment for 30 minutes in the same container. The sediment consisted of erythrocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. The supernatant containing lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal-like cells was removed and sedimented at 400 x g for 7 minutes. Cells were plated in MSCGM medium (Lonza, Walkerville, MD) at a concentration of 1.33 x 10<sup>6</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> and allowed to culture for 24 hours. After 24 hours the non-adherent cells were removed by washing and the medium was replaced with fresh MSCGM 3 times per week. Cells were harvested when cultures were 80&#x02013;90% composed of cells with a fibroblastic morphology, and used to establish the clonal cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Development of clonal cell lines</title><p>Generation of clonal populations of cells was achieved by serial dilution. Plastic-adherent cord blood-derived cells with a fibroblastic appearance were grown to ~ 90% purity. These cells were detached by trypsin or Tryp-LE and diluted to a concentration of 30 cells/20 ml of MSCGM. Cells were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate (200 &#x003bc;l per well) and were left to adhere overnight. Those wells with a single cell were expanded to 60&#x02013;80% confluence, harvested and further expanded. Upon expansion, cultures were examined for a variety of surface markers to distinguish between MSC (bright CD90, negative for CD106 and CD31), MLPC (dull bimodal CD90, positive CD106, negative for CD31) and endothelial precursor cells (positive for CD90, CD106 and CD31). Establishment of clonal lines demonstrated the difference between MLPC and other mesenchymal-like cells found in cord blood. Non-MLPC mesenchymal-like cells senesced by 20 population doublings and were not capable of differentiation beyond mesodermal outcomes, while MLPC clones were capable of up to 80 population doublings and endo-, meso-, and ectodermal outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>hTERT vector production</title><p>pRRLsin.hCMV hTERT lentiviral expression plasmid was the kind gift of Dr. Noriyuki Kasahara, Department of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA.

Cells are washed twice with 10 ml RPMI + 0.01% EDTA. Cells are again pelleted and the supernatant removed. One ml of 50% polyethylene glycol in RMPI + 0.01% EDTA was added to the cells and the cells are gently resuspended. After one minute, 1 ml of RPMI+0.01% EDTA was added, and then after another minute 4 ml of RPMI + 0.01% EDTA was added both without mixing. After an additional 2 minutes 4 ml of RPMI + 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 50 x g for 10 minutes, diluted with 30 ml of RPMI + 20% FBS and resuspended. Fifteen ml of cell suspension were added to 75 cm<sup>2</sup> collagen-coated tissue culture flasks. Cells adhered to the culture flask overnight and were cultured for 1 week in RPMI + 20% FBS with culture medium exchanged every other day. After 7 days, cells were examined by confocal microscopy for co-expression of TERT and albumin by immunohistochemistry, as described below. Unfused primary hepatocytes were non-viable after 7 days and did not contribute to resultant cell lines. If 100% of the cells were double positive for TERT and albumin, no further selection was performed. If less than 100% of the cells were double positive for TERT and albumin, cells were passaged by limiting dilution and re-tested for TERT and albumin until 100% of the cells were double positive. Of the 5 fusions performed, 2 fusions required no further selection, 3 fusions required only 2 passages before 100% expression of TERT and albumin. These cells were expanded by the method described in the following section and were used in the functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Expansion of fusion cells</title><p>After stabilization of the fusion cells at 1 week of culture in RPMI + 20% FBS, cells isolated from the culture vessel were incubated with Tryp-LE (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and then pelleted at 300 x g for 5 minutes.

E12 MLPC cells are characterized by a typically spindle fibroblast-like morphology, single nucleus, obligate adhesion culture and a doubling time of ~ 24&#x02013;27 hours. Primary hepatocytes are characterized by a roundish to square shaped morphology that appears like a cobblestone when cultured at high culture densities. PH are viable under recommended culture conditions for 5&#x02013;7 days. Hepatocytes exhibited multiple nuclei in a significant proportion of plated cells. Fusion cells exhibited a cobblestone culture pattern with round, square and trapezoidal shaped cells. Individual cells were mainly mononuclear, or multi-nuclear with 2, 3 or 4 nuclei. A few individual cells expressed as many as 13 nuclei, but they did not appear to survive cryo-preservation and expansion. The multi-nuclear appearance of fusion cells was maintained through all freeze-thaw and expansion cycles.

The need for both livers and hepatocytes is underserved by the lack of sufficient donors for both organs and cells. Simply stated, there is a critical shortage of donor livers suitable for transplantation. Additionally, livers found unsuitable for transplantation are used as the sources for isolated hepatocytes. This results in primary hepatocytes that have limited viability, decreasing functionality with age, inability to expand <italic>in vitro</italic>, significant variability on biological functions between different donor hepatocytes and finite supplies of quality hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

The E12-TERT MLPC clonal cell line, possessing the best characteristics of both proliferative and differentiation capacity, were used throughout this study as the fusion partner for the primary hepatocytes.</p><p>MLPC are a subset of mesenchymal-like cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood. Experiments designed to develop clonal lines of MSC-like cells showed that only a small proportion of the cells were able to proliferate to quantities suitable for study. These clonal cells were capable of up to 80-population doublings and capable of differentiation to ecto-, endo- and mesodermal outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The remaining cell population was limited in their proliferative capacity (18&#x02013;25 population doublings) and their ability to be differentiated to non-mesodermal outcomes. Over-expression of the TERT gene product by transfection resulted in a cell (E12 cell line) that has been cultured for over 12 years and maintains its capacity for differentiation to non-mesodermal outcomes. A study describing the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of TERT-immortalized E12 cells into proliferative cells with hepatocytes functions is the subject of a separate report.</p><p>Previous publications have suggested that transfection with the TERT gene can functionally immortalize fetal liver cells or bone marrow-derived MSC without affecting their differentiation capacity. This was in contrast to more mature cell types that lost their proliferative capacity or their biological function with age [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It appears that inherent qualities present in fetal cells or stem cells enable them to achieve functional immortality via a single TERT gene. The E12 cell line exhibits those desirable qualities of proliferative and differentiation capacity with insertion of the TERT gene.</p><p>The results presented in this study demonstrate the advantage of fusion between the two cell types. E12 cells are negative for all hepatocyte-specific markers and positive for TERT. Hepatocytes are uniformly positive for hepatocyte-specific markers and mainly negative for TERT. The resultant fusion cells are uniformly positive for hepatocyte markers and TERT. This was further confirmed by PCR analysis where E12 MLPC were negative for all hepatocyte-specific RNA and the E12/HC10-3 fusion cells were uniformly positive for the hepatocytes-specific RNA as compared to human primary hepatocytes.</p><p>Functionality of resultant fusion cells was compared to the parental cell types, E12 MLPC and primary hepatocytes, by examining production of both urea and albumin. The E12 MLPC displayed very low levels of both urea and albumin production when compared to normal primary hepatocytes. In contrast, the E12/primary hepatocyte fusion cells produced significant levels of both urea and albumin, almost comparable for albumin, and in this limited study even higher levels of urea when compared to primary hepatocytes.</p><p>Bone marrow and cord blood cells have been suggested as potential sources of cells for liver regeneration based on several observations.

A number of studies were designed to determine whether the transformation of the donor stem cells was due to transdifferentiation of the stem cells to a hepatocyte phenotype, or due to fusion of the donor cells with the recipient&#x02019;s liver cells [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

In that same study, the successful implantation rate was less than 1% of the injected cells (possibly reflecting the rarity of these cells within the MSC population). Nevertheless, the results suggested that trandifferentiation was a legitimate mechanism for appearance of donor-originated hepatocytes in the recipient.

If the E12 TERT MLPC, described herein, are reflective of a small population of stem cells with characteristics of MSC-like cells within bone marrow, then both transdifferentiation and fusion are possible and not necessarily exclusive to the occurrence of functional donor cells in the liver of recipients.</p><p>Our results provide a basis for the development of immortalized liver cell lines with large-scale production capabilities for general drug metabolism and toxicology studies. In addition, it is conceivable that this methodology could be employed to create immortalized hepatocyte-like cell lines with specific pathologies to provide a renewable source of cells for research and development of new therapies. Immortalized and potentially infinitely expandable populations of clonally-derived disease-specific hepatocytes could provide an important tool for the development of new therapies for those diseases.</p><p>The successful fusion of primary hepatocytes with an immortalized cord blood-derived stem cell line (E12) resulting in a stable proliferative cell with the characteristics of hepatocytes might provide a procedural pathway for the development of other organ/cell-specific immortalized cell lines. Studies describing the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of various stem cells to functional organ-specific cells (like hepatocytes) are characterized by large variances in the time to differentiation, growth factor compositions, viability and more. <italic>In vitro</italic> differentiation protocols suffer from the current inability to mimic all of the tissue-specific and time-dependent differentiation signals that occur during the development of the fetus. The ability to by-pass those complicated and time-consuming experiments necessary to clearly define the proper sequences of growth factors, culture conditions and the contributions of extra-cellular matrices could speed the development of organ and cell-specific immortalized cell lines. The application of a four decades-old simple and highly repeatable methodology that has been successfully applied to generate monoclonal antibodies could shortcut the development time for differentiated cells, and tissues. Employment of this methodology could enable similar cell fusions with other cell types creating immortalized cell lines with the characteristics of pancreas, neurons, and numerous other cell types.</p><p>Finally, a renewable source of functional hepatocyte-like cells could contribute significantly to the development of artificial liver support systems. One could imagine an extracorporeal system containing cells that would enable patients with liver failure to regenerate their own livers or survive as a bridge to transplant [<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report observations with regards to TERT-immortalized MLPC. They were capable of conferring immortality upon fusion with human primary hepatocytes. The resultant fusion cells retained the biological activity of the primary hepatocytes and the immortality of the TERT-immortalized MLPC. Fusion cells retained 100% expression of hTERT as well as expression of mRNA, urea and albumin production, and intracellular marker expression characteristic of primary hepatocytes. These cells have been serially cultured for an extensive period without loss of hepatocyte biological activity nor their immortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0234002.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0234002.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0234002.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primer sequences for PCR.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0234002.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Noriyuki Kashara, Department of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA for contributing the hTERT expression plasmid; Dr. Eve Kelland, Department of Neurology, Keck School of Medicine, USC, Los Angeles, CA for transfection of MLPC cells with the hTERT gene and LeAnn Oseth, Cytogenetics Core Laboratory, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota for karyotypic analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0234002.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Katsura</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ikai</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mitaka</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shiotani</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yamanokuchi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sugimoto</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
