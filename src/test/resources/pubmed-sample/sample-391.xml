Some properties of aptamers that make them promising therapeutic reagents include the intermediate size of aptamers, ease of development, and absence of synthesis constraints associated with small molecule inhibitors and protein-based drugs (e.g., antibodies). Aptamers routinely achieve binding affinities and specificities comparable to therapeutic antibodies. In addition, due to their amenability to modification by medicinal chemistry, aptamers avoid the immunogenicity concerns of protein-based drugs and can be engineered to have optimized pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Keefe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, aptamers can be generated to a range of therapeutic targets more efficiently than is the case for small molecules, high-throughput drug screens or cell-based antibody production.</p><p>Isolation of aptamers with affinity and specificity for a target of interest involves iterative rounds of affinity purification and amplification <italic>via</italic> a process termed SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) <xref rid="pone.0043836-Tuerk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Ellington1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In a typical SELEX experiment, a random sequence oligonucleotide library (with approximately 1&#x000d7;10<sup>15</sup> sequences) is incubated with a protein target. The protein-bound aptamers are then specifically recovered and amplified by PCR. Single stranded DNA or RNA sequences are then generated from the amplified product and used in a subsequent round of selection. Since the invention of the SELEX process around 1990, many high affinity aptamers that target a wide-range of proteins including transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0043836-Martell1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, cytokines <xref rid="pone.0043836-Kubik1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, growth factors <xref rid="pone.0043836-Jellinek1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Ruckman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, proteases <xref rid="pone.0043836-Fukuda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Charlton1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, serum proteins <xref rid="pone.0043836-Bock1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Ahmad1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, cell-surface receptors <xref rid="pone.0043836-Lupold1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, cell-adhesion molecules <xref rid="pone.0043836-Theis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Hicke1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and viral proteins <xref rid="pone.0043836-Tuerk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Khati1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> have been identified.</p><p>Although the traditional SELEX method utilizes a soluble, pure form of the target protein (i.e., recombinant protein), different methods have also been developed that target aptamers to membrane-associated cell surface proteins, termed whole-cell SELEX) <xref rid="pone.0043836-Cerchia1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Blank1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Like traditional SELEX, whole-cell SELEX is an evolutionary approach, yet whole-cell SELEX allows the selection of aptamers without prior knowledge of specific targets <xref rid="pone.0043836-Shangguan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Cerchia2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, whole-cell SELEX can, in principle, generate aptamers to multiple targets in parallel while favoring accessible cell surface epitopes. A major advantage of the whole-cell SELEX method over the traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> SELEX approach is that it facilitates the identification of aptamer sequences that recognize the target (e.g. membrane receptor) in its native milieu; that is, in the context of the cellular membrane. Importantly, this approach overcomes the difficulties in obtaining purified preparations of recombinant membrane proteins <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In addition, whole-cell SELEX eliminates the risk that one could select aptamers that will only bind to the purified protein and do not recognize the native form of the protein on living cells.</p><p>Aptamers that bind to extracellular targets have high potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. For diagnostics, aptamers are used to differentiate among different cell types, such as normal and tumor cells <xref rid="pone.0043836-Hicke1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For therapeutic applications, aptamers that bind to the cell surface can be used directly as activators or inhibitors, or indirectly to direct therapeutics, including small molecule drugs, radioisotopes, toxins or siRNAs, to persist in the vicinity of a specific cell or tissue type <xref rid="pone.0043836-Keefe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The latter strategy is likely to increase efficacy as well as reduce potential unwanted toxic effects of the therapy. In addition, these reagents can also potentially be used to deliver therapeutics into the cells by increasing the rate of receptor-mediated endocytosis <xref rid="pone.0043836-Wullner1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>While whole cell-SELEX has increased the repertoire of aptamers that bind to membrane receptors <xref rid="pone.0043836-Cerchia1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Daniels1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, this methodology does not necessarily select for aptamers capable of accessing intracellular compartments for delivering macromolecules into cells. To isolate RNA aptamers that internalize into target cells, we have recently developed a novel cell-based selection strategy that we refer to as <italic>cell-internalization SELEX</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our approach has several advantages over the traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> SELEX approach: (1) it favors the isolation of RNAs that bind to receptors in their native state; and (2) it enriches for RNAs that are internalized by the target cell. Using the cell-internalization SELEX approach, we enriched for aptamers that selectively bind to and internalize into HER2<sup>+</sup>-breast cancer cells for delivering therapeutic siRNAs to the cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>A potential downside to the cell-based SELEX approaches as compared to traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> SELEX is that cells are much more complex targets than single recombinant proteins. Two major challenges for cell-based aptamer selections are 1) insufficient methods to monitor the progression of a cell-based selection, and 2) the complexity of aptamer sequences derived from this type of selection. We address these issues by applying a combination of HTS and bioinformatics analysis to the cell-internalization SELEX approach. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by identifying vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-specific internalizing aptamers. We also demonstrate the importance of categorizing aptamers based on structural similarity (structure families), in addition to sequence similarity (sequence families), in order to encourage the identification of functional sequences. In summary, these studies demonstrate the utility of HTS and bioinformatics analysis for facilitating the rapid identification of &#x02018;winner&#x02019; sequences from an aptamer selection performed against a complex target. Furthermore, these studies have resulted in several VSMC-specific internalizing RNA sequences that could be used to deliver siRNAs or other small molecule drugs specifically to VSMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Enrichment of VSMC-specific internalizing RNA aptamers</title><p>Aptamers that selectively internalize into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs; A7r5) were enriched using the <italic>cell-internalization SELEX protocol</italic>

<bold>Figure 1B-D</bold>
</xref>). The DNA melt assay allows for rapid and cost-effective analysis of selection progression and can be easily applied to complex cell-based selections. In this assay, the DNA from a given selection round (from the PCR amplification SELEX step) is heated at high temperatures (melted) and, as the temperature is decreased, the efficiency of re-annealing of the melted DNA is measured by SYBR green fluorescence. A relative loss in library complexity is indicative of a shift in the DNA melt curve towards higher temperatures. A significant drop in library complexity was observed between rounds 2 and 3 of selection as evidenced by the shift in the round 3 DNA melt curve towards higher temperatures, compared to the DNA melt curves of rounds 0 through 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043836-g001">
<bold>Figure 1B</bold>
</xref>). This initial drop in library complexity was an indication that additional selective pressures could be introduced to further enrich for VSMCs-specific RNA aptamers. Thus, a negative-selection step (pre-clear against YPEN-1 cells) was introduced at round 4 of selection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043836-t001">

In spite of this trend towards more sophisticated aptamer identification approaches, the computational tools for the downstream analysis of millions of sequence reads, which result from HTS efforts, are still being streamlined. Here we describe a novel approach that couples HTS with bioinformatics tools to facilitate the identification of over 30 &#x02018;winner&#x02019; RNA sequences from a complex, cell-internalization aptamer selection. To identify candidate aptamer sequences, high-throughput sequence data from eight rounds of negative and positive selection were analyzed using these novel methods. Metrics for determining % Enrichment confirmed the experimental cell-internalization data suggesting the selection was complete after eight rounds of selection. Millions of &#x02018;true-selected&#x02019; sequences were separated from the non-selected ones using metrics based on the <italic>number of rounds</italic> a sequence was present in and on the <italic>cluster size</italic> for each sequence. The metrics analysis for selection enrichment made it possible to sort through millions of reads and rapidly eliminate those sequences that were not selected or were present in the dataset as a result of sequencing errors. All the unique reads that comprised the &#x02018;true-selected&#x02019; sequences were then clustered based on either sequence similarity using edit distance analysis or structural similarity using tree distance analysis. Importantly, these analyses resulted in the identification of sequences that would otherwise have been missed by conventional means, that is, by selecting only the top sequence reads.</p><p>The approach described herein, is of importance in light of the rise in complex target SELEX, in which aptamers are directly selected against complex protein mixtures, cells, or even whole organisms <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Daniels1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Shangguan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Layzer1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Mi2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Although these methods are still in their infancy relative to the original <italic>in vitro</italic> SELEX method, many of the cell-specific aptamers generated so far have served well as neutralizing ligands <xref rid="pone.0043836-Cerchia1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, real-time detection probes <xref rid="pone.0043836-Mallikaratchy1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, as well as internalizing escorts <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Particularly impressive, are selections performed against whole organisms (<italic>in vivo</italic>-SELEX) that include the isolation of RNA aptamers that recognize African trypanosomes <xref rid="pone.0043836-Homann1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043836-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. These aptamers have the potential to target biomarkers on the surface of the parasite or bacterium and as such might be modified to function as novel drugs against these unicellular organisms. While African trypanosomes and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> are examples of simple, unicellular organisms, complex <italic>in vivo-</italic>selections have also been attempted in order to isolate aptamers against intrahepatic carcinomas in mice <xref rid="pone.0043836-Mi2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In this work, the authors performed intravenous injections of chemically modified RNA pools into tumor bearing mice. Those aptamers that localized to the tumors were extracted and amplified. These efforts resulted in two RNA sequences that target an intracellular, RNA binding protein (P68) overexpressed in the hepatic tumor.</p><p>Despite the complex nature of published aptamer selections, the resulting &#x02018;winner&#x02019; aptamer sequences are typically few in number and, in most cases, only one sequence is identified and further characterized. The likely reason for the &#x0201c;one selection-one aptamer&#x0201d; phenomenon is that only the most highly represented sequences are sequenced using the traditional chain terminator method, i.e., Sanger sequencing <xref rid="pone.0043836-Daniels1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Shangguan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Layzer1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043836-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Mi3" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Recently, the advent of HTS technologies has streamlined the sequencing process, allowing researchers to obtain a more comprehensive picture of all selected sequences after only a few rounds of selection <xref rid="pone.0043836-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Ahmad1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Berezhnoy1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Schutze2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Although these published studies were performed against purified, recombinant proteins, the authors observed that the sequences with the highest read number were not necessarily the highest affinity binders <xref rid="pone.0043836-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Schutze2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

These findings are in agreement with our data demonstrating that cell-specific internalization of &#x02018;winner&#x02019; sequences positively correlated with <italic>fold enrichment</italic>. Interestingly, although we also observed a positive correlation between <italic>fold internalization</italic> and <italic>read number</italic>, this association occurred only after the introduction of a negative selection step. Together, these studies highlight the importance of performing HTS on all rounds of selection in order to assess <italic>fold enrichment</italic> of specific sequences over the course of a selection. In addition, our data identify the negative-selection step as a key criterion to successfully enrich for cell-specific sequences <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>To date, bioinformatics analyses performed on aptamer selections have relied predominantly on an arbitrary cutoff, typically based on <italic>read number</italic>, to identify aptamers sequences that are subsequently analyzed experimentally <xref rid="pone.0043836-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043836-Berezhnoy1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. While this strategy has proven effective, candidate sequences with a low read number are have a high probability of being missed or disregarded. In order to identify all possible &#x02018;winner&#x02019; sequences, including those that were not highly-represented, we performed pairwise comparisons using <italic>edit distance</italic> and <italic>tree distance</italic> analyses to identify sequences that are related based on sequence or structure. These analyses resulted in the identification of 27 sequences (out of 32) that were among the best cell-specific internalizing aptamers (fold internalization &#x02265;4). Of particular importance, the aptamer with the highest fold internalization (#51) was not among the aptamers with the highest read number. Aptamer #51 was identified only through the <italic>tree distance</italic> analysis, highlighting that RNA structure should also be considered when choosing sequences for experimental validations.</p><p>A potential current limitation of the <italic>tree distance</italic> analysis is that it is based on the assumption that each sequence has only a single predicted structure. While RNA molecules can assume multiple breathing dynamics, our data seem to indicate that structural diversity decreases over the course of a selection. However, the inclusion of all possible RNA structures may improve the outcome of current tree distance analyses, though this type of analysis is currently hindered by the existing algorithms for structure prediction. Indeed, we anticipate these multi-structure analyses are likely to become more feasible as predictive RNA structural algorithms evolve and as computational algorithms become more complex.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies highlight the utility of combining HTS with bioinformatics analysis for the identification of &#x02018;winner&#x02019; sequences from an aptamer selection performed against a complex target. These efforts have yielded (1) predictive tools that are broadly applicable to all aptamer selections for target sequence identification; and (2) several VSMC-specific RNA aptamers that can subsequently be used for targeted delivery. Thus, as the aptamer field enters an exciting new chapter in which HTS and bioinformatics tools become a critical component of aptamer discovery, methodologies such as the one described herein both complement and add to existing approaches for sifting through millions of sequence reads generated from high-throughput sequencing data of aptamer selections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>All cell lines were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
