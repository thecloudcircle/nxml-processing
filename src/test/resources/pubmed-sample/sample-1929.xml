HBV infection affects approximately 350 million people in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and is strongly associated with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Even though multiple factors have been implicated in HBV-associated pathogenesis and carcinogenesis, the exact molecular mechanism underlying chronic HBV-induced liver cancer remains largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Data from HBV-infected individuals and <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments have shown that activation of the intrahepatic cytokine network may play an important role in pathogenesis of acute and chronic liver inflammation and injury caused by HBV infection. Expression of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], interleukin-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], inducible nitric oxide synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and cyclooxygenase-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] are increased in response to HBV infection, or are involved in HBV-associated HCC development.</p><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible COX isoform required for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, such as PGE2, and is primarily involved in pathological processes such as inflammation, fibrogenesis, and carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Increases in COX-2 and PGE2 have been reported in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. COX-2 is induced at the transcriptional level by a variety of stimuli including cytokines, mitogens, and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Its promoter region contains a TATA box, an E box, and binding sites for a number of transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B, NF-AT/AP1, NF-IL6/C/EBP, and CREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>It is well accepted that viral proteins stimulate COX-2 expression, such as latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Gp120 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and Tat of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and core and NS5A of human hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that NS3 of HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] induce COX-2 expression in virus infected cells. Upregulation of COX-2 was also observed in liver tissues chronically infected with HBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that HBx, a 17.5 kDa multifunctional transactivator encoded by the HBV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], is likely the most important determinant of COX-2 induction in human cells infected with HBV. Importantly, this of COX-2 expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>DNA methylation and histone modifications represent the major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the regulation of gene transcription in mammals. DNA methylation is a predominant mechanism employed to inactivate relevant genes during tumorigenesis associated with HCC. DNA methylation occurs at carbon 5 of cytosine, primarily in the context of the CpG dinucleotide. Recent findings support the hypothesis that hypomethylation of the DNA surrounding the proximal promoter region is a prerequisite for gene activation, whereas hypermethylation leads to gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Mechanistically, there are a number of ways in which DNA methylation can repress transcription. For example, many of the <italic>trans </italic>factors known to bind to sequences containing CpG dinucleotides do not bind when the CpG doublets are methylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Identification of methylated regions in the COX-2 promoter during HBV infection will aid in understanding the mechanisms by which this gene is regulated.</p><p>To study the influence of HBV on the expression of COX-2, we first examined the amount of PGE2 in the peripheral blood serum of patients with chronic hepatitis B. We also analyzed the mechanism of COX-2 upregulation in HBV-positive cells as well as in HBx-transfected cells. Our results showed that COX-2 expression was induced in both HBV-positive and HBx-expressing cells, and that activation of the COX-2 promoter by HBx depended on C/EBP and CREB binding sites, in which C/EBP&#x003b2; played an important role. HBx directly interacted with C/EBP&#x003b2;, and enhanced its binding to the COX-2 promoter. DNA methylation analysis revealed that global hypomethylation of the COX-2 promoter and specific demethylation of the NF-AT binding sites occurred in HBV-positive cells. Among the three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) present in mammalian cells, DNMT3B played a key role in COX-2 promoter methylation, and its decreased affinity for the promoter was responsible for the specific regional demethylation and the increased binding of transcription factors. Together, this study shows that both aberrant epigenetic modifications and transcription factors contribute to the HBV-induced COX-2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Elevated serum PGE2 in HBV patients</title><p>High level expression of circulating PGE2 was observed in patients with chronic HBV infection.

To test if expression of HBV influences COX-2, expression of COX-2 in HepG2 human hepatoma cells was compared with that in HepG2.2.15 cells, which contain an integrated HBV genome. We analyzed COX-2 mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR, and detected an increase in COX-2 mRNA in HepG2.2.15 cells as compared to HepG2 cells, which do not express HBV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The amount of COX-2 protein was next estimated by Western blot analysis, and endogenous COX-2 protein was increased in HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), suggesting that the presence of HBV regulates COX-2 expression. To test if the upregulation of COX-2 correlates with the expression of HBx, a reporter plasmid in which the COX-2 promoter was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene (pCOX-2-Luc) was transfected with pHBV-1.2 or pHBV-1.2*7 and the control plasmid pRL-TK into HepG2 human hepatoma cells, which support HBV replication. pHBV-1.2 contains 1.2-fold length of the HBV genome and retains the ability to produce mature HBV virions. pHBV-1.2*7 is an HBV mutant that does not express HBx. Luciferase activity was measured in each sample, and results showed that wild-type HBV activated COX-2 promoter whereas the HBV mutant failed to induce COX-2 promoter activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Since expression of luciferase in these cells could only come from activity at the COX-2 promoter in the reporter plasmid, it is likely that COX-2 expression is regulated by HBx at the level of transcription. We next transfected HepG2 cells with pCOX-2-Luc and increasing concentrations of the pCMV-HBx plasmid, and found that HBx stimulated the COX-2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To further confirm the effects of HBx on COX-2 expression, the pCMV-HBx plasmid was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis showed elevated level of COX-2 mRNA and protein in HBx transfeted cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>COX-2 is upregulated in HBV-positive cells</bold>.

Elevated COX-2 activity in HBV or HBx expressing cells was next monitored by measuring the accumulation of secreted PGE2 in culture supernatants from HepG2.2.15 cells, or from HepG2 cells transfected with pCMV-HBx. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, the concentration of PGE2 was higher in HBV-positive or HBx-expressing cells as opposed to control cells. We next confirmed the specificity of COX-2 regulation for PGE2 secretion by treating the cells with NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2. We found that treatment with NS-398 significantly reduced the amount of secreted PGE2 as compared to untreated cells, confirming the specific relationship between HBV- and HBx-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><p>To show the consistency of the above results with clinical manifestations of hepatitis B, we performed qRT-PCR analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hepatitis B patients.

As expected, LIP inhibited HBx-induced COX-2 promoter activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), likely due to the absence of a DNA-binding domain.

HepG2 cells were transfected with these plasmids, in addition to the control plasmid pRL-TK, and our results showed that luciferase expression in cells transfected with both pM-HBx and pVP16-LAP was much higher than in control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), confirming a direct interaction between HBx and C/EBP&#x003b2;.</p><p>Prior studies have suggested that HBx may interact with bZip factors through the bZip domain, which promotes the binding to and activation of target promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Supershifted complexes were observed when C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody was added (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lane 6), confirming that HBx induces the binding of C/EBP&#x003b2; to the COX-2 promoter.</p><p>We next confirmed the HBx-induced C/EBP&#x003b2; binding to the COX-2 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP).

The COX-2 promoter region, consisting of nucleotides -155 to -2 relative to the transcription start site and containing C/EBP binding sequences, was amplified from the chromatin precipitates by PCR. We observed that the amount of C/EBP&#x003b2; bound to the COX-2 promoter was higher in the presence of HBx (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, lane 3) as opposed to cells not expressing HBx (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, lane 4).

Importantly, two known NF-AT motifs (-73 and -165), both of which contain a CpG site, were demethylated on the COX-2 promoter in HBV-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells, indicating that site-specific demethylation of NF-AT sites are essential for NF-AT binding and COX-2 promoter activation.</p><p>We next tested the influence of methylation on the affinity of NF-AT to its binding motif on the COX-2 promoter.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, methylation of these nucleotides inhibited the formation of DNA-protein complexes, suggesting that the binding affinity between NF-AT and the COX-2 promoter after demethylation of the CpG dinucleotide on its binding motif was enhanced.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, COX-2 promoter activity was downregulated after knock-down of DNMT3A, and was upregulated by knock-down of DNMT3B. Co-transfection of DNMT expression plasmids with pCOX-2-Luc revealed that DNMT3B decreased COX-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas DNMT3A increased in activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We next investigated the recruitment of these three DNMTs to the COX-2 promoter by ChIP assay. Chromatin fragments were prepared from HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells and were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for DNMT1, DNMT3A, or DNMT3B. The COX-2 promoter was then amplified by PCR, and we found that DNMT3B binding to the COX-2 promoter was reduced in HBV-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells, whereas that of DNMT3A and DNMT1 was increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).

So the different DNA binding affinities may due to different expressions of DNMTs. These findings, combined with previous results that the COX-2 promoter is demethylated in HBV-expressing cells, suggest that DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A plays a key role in COX-2 promoter methylation, and that the decreased activity of DNMT3B in the nucleus is likely responsible for hypomethylation of the COX-2 promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we observed significant increases in PEG2 synthesis in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, and also detected elevated COX-2 expression in HBV and HBx-expressing liver cells. We demonstrated a previously unrecognized mechanism of COX-2 regulation, where demethylation-linked recruitment of multiple transcription factors to the COX-2 promoter activated HBV-induced COX-2 expression. Demethylation of CpG dinucleotides within the NF-AT binding sites in the COX-2 promoter resulted in the increased binding affinity of NF-AT to the cognate sites in the promoter, followed by increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 accumulation. The association of HBx with C/EBP&#x003b2; also contributed to the induction of COX-2. Likewise, DNMT3B played a key role in the methylation of the COX-2 promoter, as the reduced binding between DNMT3B and the COX-2 promoter was responsible for the regional demethylation of the CpG sites, and for the increased binding of transcription factors in HBV-positive cells.</p><p>COX-2, the inducible isoform of COX, is highly expressed in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli and other cellular stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and previous studies have shown increased levels of COX-2 in a variety of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Importantly, overexpression of COX-2 is closely linked to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Chronic infection with HBV or HCV is the leading cause of liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and elevated expression of COX-2 has been described in different liver cirrhosis animal models and liver tissue from cancer patients with chronic HBV or HCV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. HBx is a transcriptional activator that is required for viral infection and contributes to HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that HBx activates a large number of cellular genes related to HBV-associated HCC, including the COX-2 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Coexpression of HBx and COX-2 was detected in chronic liver diseases associated with HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and HBx also promotes tumor cell invasion by inducing membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase and COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the molecular details of COX-2 activation during chronic HBV infection remain to be defined.</p><p>It has been well established that NF-&#x003ba;B, C/EBP, and CREB are the primary transcription factors responsible for the regulation of COX-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study we demonstrated that the C/EBP and CRE binding sites, but not those of NF-&#x003ba;B, were critical for HBx-induced COX-2 promoter activation. It is possible that NF-&#x003ba;B might be involved in COX-2 expression, but that it is not directly responsible for that induced by HBx.</p><p>We investigated the effect of HBx and the C/EBP&#x003b2; isoform on COX-2 promoter activity, as C/EBP&#x003b2; is widely involved in inflammation and cellular proliferation of a number of cell types, including hepatocytes, and regulates gene transcription in response to a varity of stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We found that the effects of different isoforms of C/EBP&#x003b2; played diverse roles in this process. LAP (transcription activator) and HBx had a synergistic effect on COX-2 promoter activation, whereas LIP (transcription repressor) led to a decrease in HBx-induced COX-2 expression. These data suggest that C/EBP&#x003b2;, cooperatively with HBx, activates COX-2 transcription through the transactivation domain of C/EBP&#x003b2;. Likewise, bZip transcription factors, such as CREB and C/EBP, were reported to interact with HBx and target a variety of promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We detected a direct interaction between HBx and C/EBP&#x003b2;, which may contribute to the reinforcement of C/EBP&#x003b2; binding to the COX-2 promoter, and the subsequent upregulation of COX-2 expression.</p><p>Others have confirmed a direct correlation between the expression of a given gene and its methylation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and previous studies have proposed promoter methylation as a mechanism to regulate COX-2 expression in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Likewise, other studies have shown that DNA methylation of certain promoters is associated with HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Since many of the <italic>trans </italic>factors known to bind to sequences containing CpG dinucleotides do not bind when such regions are methylated, we looked for relationships between transcription factor binding and aberrant epigenetic modifications in the COX-2 promoter during HBV infection. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the CpG island in the promoter (nucleotides -204 to +57) revealed the hypomethylation of the COX-2 promoter in HBV-expressing cells. More importantly, demethylation of two NF-AT motifs, which contained CpG sites, was detected in these cells, and EMSA data indicated a higher affinity of NF-AT for the demethylated motif of the COX-2 promoter. As a previous report found that HBx activates the COX-2 promoter in an NF-AT dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], our results describe a possible mechanism for the role of NF-AT in this process. Considering the complex interactions of HBx, C/EBP&#x003b2; and NF-AT, demethylation of NF-AT sites might lead to the binding of different <italic>trans </italic>factors. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the C/EBP&#x003b2;- and NF-AT-dependent COX-2 activation by HBV and HBx.</p><p>DNMT1 is activated by the Ras-AP-1 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes are mediated by DNMT3A or DNMT3B, and diminished expression of DNMT3B was detected in HBx-expressing liver cell lines, resulting in genomic hypomethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We investigated the role of these three DNMTs in the epigenetic modifications of the COX-2 promoter. We found that DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A was critical for methylation of the COX-2 promoter, and ChIP assays showed that the binding of DNMT3B to the COX-2 promoter was decreased in HBV-expressing cells. A recent study demonstrated the interaction of HBx with DNMT3A and unraveled a possible mechanism involved in HBx-mediated epigenetic modifications and gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In our study, we investigated the role of three DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNM3B) in the epigenetic modifications of the COX-2 promoter through overexpression and siRNA technology. Considering both the binding of DNMT3B and the total DNMTs activities in the nucleus of HBV-expressing cells were decreased, our results indicate that DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A plays a major role in COX-2 promoter methylation. The increased binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3A to COX-2 promoter in HBV-expressing cells indicates the complex situation in HBV-mediated epigenetic modifications and gene regulation. It is possible that DNMT3A may play a minor role in controlling COX-2 expression through another mechanism. Other researches have showed the importance of mitochondrial pathway in HBx-induced COX-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. We are more concerned about the aberrant epigenetic modifications induced by HBx and its role as a transcriptional coactivator in HBV induced COX-2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>All the data above are consistent with the finding that the COX-2 promoter is hypomethylated in HBV-expressing cells, and suggests a possible mechanism for transcriptional activation of COX-2 by HBV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In normal cells, the COX-2 promoter is hypermethylated and transcription repressors, such as DNMT3B, bind to the methylated CpG sites and repress its activity. After HBV infection, the expression of the virus and HBx trigger demethylation of the COX-2 promoter by down-regulating DNMT3B, which is responsible for the methylation of the promoter. Methylation relieves repression of the promoter and transcription factors such as NF-AT and C/EBP&#x003b2; are able to bind. Interactions between HBx and C/EBP&#x003b2;, NF-AT enhance the recruitment of the complex to the COX-2 promoter, the transcription machinery is assembled, and the COX-2 gene is expressed.

Primers used to generate the primary PCR product were: COX-2-nest up 5'-GGAGGGATTAGATAGGAGAG-3' and COX-2-nest down 5'-AAATAAACTTTACTATCTAA-3'. To obtain products for sequencing, a secondary round of PCR was performed using the primary PCR products and the primers COX-2-up 5'-TTTAAATTGGGGTAGTTTTT-3' and COX-2-down 5'-CTACTAAAAAATTCCTAAA-3'. Secondary PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into a TA cloning vector (Promega). Individual plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)</title><p>Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells according to methods described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

Each probe was end-labeled with [&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Biotech). EMSA was performed by incubating 2 &#x003bc;g of nuclear extract with labeled probes (15,000 cpm; 10 fmol) in binding buffer (4 mM Tris-HCl, 12 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT) containing 1 &#x003bc;g of poly (dI-dC) for 25 min at room temperature. To ensure specific binding of transcription factors to the probes, the probes were chased by 100-fold molar excess of cold wild-type, mutant, or methylated oligonucleotides. Samples were electrophoresed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with running buffer (22.5 mM Tris borate and 0.5 mM EDTA), and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><p>HepG2 and HepG2.2.1.5 cells were incubated for 24 hours after transfection (if transfection was necessary), after which they were serum-starved for an additional 24 hours. One percent formaldehyde was added to the culture medium, and the cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, and lysed in buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and protease inhibitor cocktail, for 10 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated on ice and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 &#x000d7;g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. One-fourth of the supernatant was used as DNA input control. The remaining sample was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) followed by incubation with antibodies against C/EBP&#x003b2;, DNMT1, DNMT3A, or DNMT3B overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using protein A/G-sepharose. The pellets were washed for four times with dialysis buffer containing 2 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. After washing, the precipitates were incubated in an elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) at room temperature. Supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, and RNase A was added to destroy bound RNA in the sample. Samples were incubated at 65&#x000b0;C for 5 hours to reverse formaldehyde crosslinks, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol and extracted two times with phenol/chloroform. Pellets were suspended in TE buffer and subjected to PCR amplification using the COX-2 promoter detection primers C/EBP up: -155 TAAAAAACCCTGCCCCCACCGG -134, C/EBP down: -2 TCGCTAACCGAGAGAACCTTCCTT -25, DNMTs-b up: -177 CCGATTTTCTCATTTCCGTGGG -156, and DNMTs-b down: -56 CGAAATGACTGTTTCTTTCCGCC -78.</p></sec><sec><title>DNMT activity assays</title><p>Nuclear extracts and total cellular proteins from HepG2 and HepG2.2.1.5 cells were prepared and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad).
