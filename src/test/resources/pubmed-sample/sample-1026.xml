Myc is a proto-oncogene often found to be deregulated in many cancers, and thus is an attractive target for design of cancer therapy. Therefore, understanding the relationship between anti-Myc strategies and autophagy will be important for development of effective therapy. Here, we show that Myc depletion inhibits autophagosome formation and impairs clearance of autophagy substrates. Myc suppression has an inhibitory effect on autophagy via reduction of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) phosphorylation. Additionally, the decrease in JNK1 phosphorylation observed with Myc knockdown is associated with a reduction in ROS production. Our data suggest that targeting Myc in cancer therapy might have the additional benefit of inhibiting autophagy in the case of therapy resistance associated with chemotherapy-induced autophagy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved process for bulk degradation of cytoplasmic contents. It involves the sequestration of portions of cytoplasm through the formation of double-membraned autophagosomes, which are subsequently targeted for degradation after fusion with lysosomes. Under normal conditions, autophagy is maintained at a basal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C1">1</xref>), where it is essential for quality control of the cytoplasmic environment through the maintenance of energy balance and by eliminating dysfunctional organelles and aggregate-prone proteins. Under stress conditions, such as starvation and hypoxia, autophagy is induced as an adaptive response, and drives the catabolism of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates for <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of biomacromolecules, which enables cells to meet their metabolic and energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C2">2</xref>). Therefore, autophagy is crucial for conferring cytoprotective effects and promoting cell survival under various stress conditions.</p><p>Autophagy can be regulated via diverse pathways. For instance, amino acid depletion can induce autophagy by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C3">3</xref>). There are also a number of mTOR-independent autophagy pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C5">5</xref>). In one of these, nutrient depletion leads to increased JNK1 activity, which phosphorylates B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C6">6</xref>). This phosphorylation decreases the inhibitory interaction of Bcl2 with the core autophagy protein, Beclin 1, thereby increasing Beclin 1 activity. This, in turn, activates autophagy, since Beclin 1 activates the lipid kinase Vps34, vacuolar protein sorting 34, which generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate to enhance autophagosome formation.</p><p>Dysregulation of autophagy can lead to malfunction of cellular processes and thus, contribute to pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases and cancer. In fact, cancer was the first human pathology associated with autophagy, as revealed by the discovery that expression of Beclin 1 was down regulated in 40&#x02013;75% of human breast and ovarian cancers due to monoallelic deletion of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C7">7</xref>). In addition, deletion of various regulators of autophagy, including Bax interacting factor-1 (<italic>Bif-1</italic>), ultraviolet radiation resistance-associated gene (<italic>UVRAG</italic>) and <italic>Atg4</italic>, has been shown to promote the development of spontaneous tumours in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C9">9</xref>). These studies indicate that autophagy may protect against cancer development.</p><p>On the other hand, by virtue of its pro-survival function, autophagy has also been suggested to contribute to cancer progression, especially in the late stages of disease. In particular, tumour cells growing in poorly vascularized regions are deprived of nutrients and oxygen for extended periods of time. Activation of autophagy enables recycling of macromolecules and organelles, thereby accommodating the acute energy needs of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C11">11</xref>). Furthermore, autophagy has been proposed as a common mechanism mediating therapeutic resistance to various cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C13">13</xref>). Therefore, the role of autophagy in tumourigenesis appears to be context-dependent and dynamic with the evolution of tumour cells during the course of cancer progression.</p><p>Cancer encompasses a group of diseases resulting from genetic changes that lead to unregulated cell proliferation and eventually invasive transformation. Deregulated expression of c-Myc (hereafter referred to as Myc) is one of the most common lesions occurring in human cancers of diverse origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C15">15</xref>), as high levels of Myc can lead to uncontrolled cell expansion and malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C16">16</xref>). There is also emerging evidence that established tumour cells may acquire a dependency on Myc activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C17">17</xref>), and thus, inhibition of Myc could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for Myc-induced cancers. Indeed, Myc depletion by using small-interfering RNA (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides or phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) has been shown to trigger cell growth arrest and apoptosis in transformed cells as well as reduced growth of tumour xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C19">19</xref>). Similar observations were made in <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, in which inhibition of Myc in a preclinical murine model of lung adenocarcinoma induced apoptosis, breakdown of the tumour microenvironment, followed by rapid tumour regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C20">20</xref>). These data have led to the development of promising strategies to allow down regulation of Myc for cancer therapy, including the development of transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C21">21</xref>).</p><p>In situations where Myc levels were elevated, autophagy appeared to be decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C23">23</xref>). This suggests that inactivation of Myc will lead to an increase in autophagy, which may be less than optimal for treating existing cancers. Therefore, understanding the effects of Myc depletion on autophagy is relevant for the design of anti-neoplastic therapy, as autophagy modulators and inhibitors are currently being investigated as chemotherapy strategies. Accordingly, we sought to understand the effects of Myc suppression on autophagy. Contrary to our expectations, we showed that Myc knockdown or inhibition had a very clear inhibitory effect on autophagy. We further elucidated that Myc regulates autophagy through changes in JNK1 activity and phosphorylation of its downstream target, Bcl2. As conventional cancer treatment often leads to development of resistance towards therapy, it is intriguing to envisage Myc as a target in which the issue of therapy efficacy and resistance can be simultaneously addressed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Myc inhibition impairs autophagosome formation</title><p>To investigate whether Myc plays a role in autophagy, we first performed siRNA knockdown of the gene and examined its effects on microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-II) protein levels. LC3-II is the only known protein to specifically associate with autophagosomes, and thus, it is widely accepted as a marker for monitoring autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C24">24</xref>). LC3 is first synthesized as a precursor in the form of pro-LC3. It is then proteolytically processed into LC3-I, which remains as a cytoplasmic protein and does not associate with autophagosomes. LC3-I is subsequently conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosomes to form LC3-II. LC3-II levels robustly correlate with autophagosome numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C24">24</xref>). The most common method to assay for autophagy is by immunoblotting for LC3-II levels, normalized to actin or tubulin as the loading control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C25">25</xref>).</p><p>Knockdown of Myc in HeLa cells decreased LC3-II levels, and this correlated with a reduction in endogenous Myc expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F1">1</xref>A). To verify that this was not due to an off-target effect of the smartpool siRNAs, we confirmed that LC3-II levels were also decreased with two different oligos targeted against Myc (oligos 1 and 2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F1">1</xref>B). Since changes in LC3-II levels may reflect alterations in either its rate of synthesis or degradation, LC3-II levels were assessed in the presence of saturating concentrations of Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1). Baf A1 is a lysosomal inhibitor that blocks the fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes, thereby preventing LC3-II degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C26">26</xref>). This allows for specific evaluation of changes in LC3-II formation, without confounding changes in its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C25">25</xref>). Myc knockdown decreased LC3-II levels even in the presence of Baf A1, confirming that Myc affects autophagosome formation rather than its degradation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F1">1</xref>C). Similar observations were obtained in HEK293 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt381/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>A) and Myc knockout (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) rat fibroblasts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt381/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>B), in which Myc depletion decreased LC3-II levels in both the absence and the presence of Baf A1.

This compound appears to inhibit Myc both by disrupting its dimerization with its obligate partner, Max, which is required for transactivation of target genes and by reducing Myc mRNA expression in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C27">27</xref>). Consistent with the genetic data, chemical inhibition of Myc resulted in decreased LC3-II levels in both HeLa (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F1">1</xref>D) and HEK293 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt381/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>C).</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the decrease in LC3-II levels observed is due to suppression in the transcriptional activity of Myc on LC3, Atg5 knockout (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) murine embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) were used. Atg5 &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs lack the Atg5 protein that is required for the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and thus, only LC3-I can be detected in Atg5&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs. If there was less transcription of LC3 itself, then lower LC3-I levels would be detected in Atg5&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs upon Myc inhibition. We observed no change in LC3-I levels in Atg5&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs treated with an Myc inhibitor, suggesting that Myc inhibition does not result in reduced transcription of LC3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F1">1</xref>E).</p><p>In addition to immunoblotting, an alternative approach to assess autophagy is by immunofluorescence. For this, we used HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, in which GFP-LC3 associated with autophagosomes appears as green puncta. We observed that Myc knockdown decreased the number of GFP-LC3 puncta (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F1">1</xref>F).</p><p>We also assessed the numbers of double FYVE (zinc finger domain named after four cysteine-rich proteins: <bold>F</bold>ab 1 (yeast orthologue of PIKfyve), <bold>Y</bold>OTB, <bold>V</bold>ac 1 (vesicle transport protein), and <bold>E</bold>EA1) domain-containing protein (DFCP1) vesicles. DFCP1 labels phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) on autophagosome precursors, called omegasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C28">28</xref>). Consistent with an inhibition of autophagosome formation, Myc knockdown decreased the mean number of GFP-DFCP1 vesicles per cell in HEK293 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F1">1</xref>E).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Myc inhibition causes autophagy substrate accumulation</title><p>Having established that Myc inhibition impairs autophagosome formation, we next assessed the functional effects of this on autophagy substrate accumulation. p62 (SQSTM1/sequestome1) is a widely characterized endogenous autophagy substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C30">30</xref>). Consistent with a decrease in LC3-II levels, Myc knockdown in HeLa cells increased p62 levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F2">2</xref>A). p62 levels were also elevated in Myc &#x02212;/&#x02212; rat fibroblasts, compared with wild-type (WT) controls (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt381/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>). To validate that this was not predominantly a consequence of Myc on p62 transcription, U2OS cells stably expressing Halotag-p62 were used. The cells were labelled with a Halotag fluorescent ligand before they were treated with Myc-I. The Halotag ligand forms a covalent bond and binds irreversibly to the Halotag protein. This enables a fixed pool of Halotag-p62 protein to be labelled and its levels can be monitored over time after labelling in a chase period which is independent of any changes in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C31">31</xref>). Inhibition of Myc during the chase period resulted in more labelled Halotag-p62 levels remaining in comparison to controls, consistent with decreased clearance and autophagy impairment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F2">2</xref>B). To further confirm if the accumulation of p62 was due to attenuation in its clearance rate, HEK293 cells with inducible expression of GFP-p62 were subjected to knockdown experiments with Myc or control siRNAs. After siRNA transfection, the expression of GFP-p62 was induced for 24 h before being turned off and we assessed the amount of GFP-p62 that was cleared over time, at the time its expression was turned off (<italic>t</italic> = 0), and 24 h after switching-off (<italic>t</italic> = 24). Myc knockdown caused a reduction in the degradation rate of GFP-p62 over time, as evident by the ratio of GFP-p62 remaining at <italic>t</italic> = 24 relative to <italic>t</italic> = 0 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F2">2</xref>C). Similarly, impaired GFP-p62 clearance was also observed with Myc-I (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F2">2</xref>D).

In conclusion, these data suggest that the effects of Myc depletion on autophagy were mediated through changes in Bcl2 phosphorylation.</p><p>To further investigate the molecular mechanism involved in Myc-modulated autophagy, we examined potential molecular players upstream of Bcl2. Activation of JNK1 has been reported to phosphorylate Bcl2, thereby inducing autophagy in cells under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C6">6</xref>). Hence, we examined the role of JNK1 in Myc-dependent Bcl2 phosphorylation and autophagy. Specifically, we studied whether the changes in Bcl2 phosphorylation was a consequence of changes in JNK1 activity. We observed that Myc knockdown led to a reduction in JNK1 phosphorylation, and this occurred in parallel with decreased phosphorylation of Bcl2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F5">5</xref>A). Correspondingly, Myc-I treatment decreased the amount of JNK1 being phosphorylated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F5">5</xref>B). Consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C35">35</xref>), LC3-II levels were found to be lower in HeLa cells treated with a JNK inhibitor (JNK-Inh), and this was associated with decreased phospho-Bcl2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt381/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>A). JNK-Inh also decreased LC3-II levels in Myc WT rat fibroblasts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F5">5</xref>C). JNK-Inh further lowered LC3-II levels even in Myc &#x02212;/&#x02212; fibroblasts, suggesting that JNK1 acts downstream of Myc in modulating autophagy. To confirm the hypothesis that JNK1 is downstream of Myc in autophagy regulation, JNK1 knockout (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) and its control (JNK +/+) MEFs were used. Myc-I could decrease LC3-II levels in JNK +/+ MEFs, but this effect was abolished in JNK &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F5">5</xref>D). In addition, we showed that transient overexpression of constitutively active JNK1 in HeLa cells could rescue the levels of LC3-II that would otherwise be decreased in Myc knockdown cells, suggesting that constitutive JNK1 could abolish the effect of Myc depletion on autophagy, perhaps by overriding the decreased JNK phosphorylation resulting from Myc knockdown (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt381/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>B).

We therefore tested whether the decrease in autophagy observed with Myc inhibition is associated with altered Bcl2-Beclin interactions. Consistent with decreased autophagy mediated through a reduction in phospho-Bcl2 and phospho-JNK1, Myc inhibition increased the interaction between Bcl2 and Beclin 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F5">5</xref>E).</p><p>In addition, as activation of JNK1 has been shown to induce autophagy under starvation conditions, we went on to investigate if Myc inhibition has the same effect on autophagy during starvation.

The extent of autophagy inhibition caused by Myc-I treatment in starvation conditions appears to be greater than the magnitude of autophagy inhibition in full medium condition because starvation is capable of increasing autophagy.

Thus, we examined the consequences of autophagy-lysosome inhibition in the context of Myc suppression inhibition on cancer cell survival (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F6">6</xref>C) by assessing the effects of increasing dosage of Myc-I on cell viability in the absence or presence of Baf A1. Myc-I clearly decreased cell viability compared with control. The extent of reduction in cell viability in response to Myc-I treatment was dose-dependent without Baf A1. The presence of Baf A1 consistently resulted in a lower cell viability compared with cells without Baf A1 at lower concentrations of Myc-I. Intriguingly, when autophagy was inhibited with Baf A1 treatment, the presence of Myc-I only minimally decreased cell viability from 0 to 60 &#x000b5;<sc>m</sc>. Our data indicate that autophagy-lysosome attenuation with Baf A1 decreased cell viability itself and delayed the onset of response towards Myc-I in terms of inhibition of cell viability. This also implies that the effects of Myc inhibition on cell viability were at least partially dependent on the autophagy-lysosome pathway.</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest that Myc knockdown, through decreased generation of ROS, resulted in less phosphorylation of JNK1 and Bcl2, which consequently led to a reduction in autophagy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT381F6">6</xref>D).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Myc plays important roles in many fundamental aspects of cell biology, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and sensitivity to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C40">40</xref>). Our study identifies a novel function of Myc in autophagy, a process important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Myc knockdown impaired autophagy through decreased phosphorylation of JNK1 and its downstream target Bcl2. The functional relevance of this observation reinforces the attractiveness of targeting Myc as a therapeutic strategy for cancers, since autophagy promotes cell survival under stress conditions, such as nutrient depletion and hypoxia, often encountered by established tumour cells.</p><p>Previously, the anti-neoplastic effect of Myc inactivation has been associated with mechanisms such as proliferative arrest, cellular senescence, terminal differentiation and apoptosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C19">19</xref>). None has directly linked the effects of Myc depletion with decreased autophagy. In fact, earlier studies have shown that cancer cells have decreased autophagic activity and increased accumulation of the autophagic substrates p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C41">41</xref>). In addition, tumour suppressors such as Beclin 1, PTEN and DAP kinase are known to positively regulate autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C42">42</xref>). Therefore, one would expect an oncogene to have inhibitory effects on autophagy. Following this, Myc depletion would be expected to induce autophagy. On the contrary, we showed that Myc knockdown decreased autophagy. This is further confirmed by inhibition of Myc with small molecule inhibitors, 10058-F4 and 10074-G8, which target different regions of Myc, and both resulted in impaired autophagy as well as decreased Bcl2 activity.</p><p>Previously, autophagy inhibition with chloroquine has been demonstrated to promote apoptosis and tumour regression in a Myc-induced lymphoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C43">43</xref>). The study suggested that autophagy is an adaptive response to enhance the survival of tumour cells in the face of apoptotic insults. It was therefore proposed that apoptosis activators can potentially be used in combination with autophagy inhibitors to enhance its therapeutic effects in human cancers. Consistent with their data, we found that inhibition of autophagy with Baf A1 decreased cell viability compared with cells without treatment. In addition, we showed that treatment with Myc-I, which inhibits autophagy, reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Myc presents an attractive target for cancer therapy as Myc suppression by different strategies has been shown to induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis in transformed cells, as well as tumour regression in Myc-induced cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C19">19</xref>). In light of our data presented here, work by Amaravadi and colleagues lends further support to targeting Myc as an anti-neoplatic strategy, especially in Myc-induced tumours, as this might confer the additional benefit of inhibiting autophagy in the case of therapy resistance associated with chemotherapy-induced autophagy. Furthermore, our data suggest that one of the added benefits of Myc inhibition in the tumour context is autophagy compromise.</p><p>Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in Myc regulation of autophagy is important for understanding of the feasibility and potential side effects that could arise from inactivation of Myc and its affected downstream targets. The closest observation was made by Tsuneoka and colleagues using a stable inducible expression of the MycER system in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C44">44</xref>), whereby they reported that the overexpression of Myc was correlated with increased autophagic vacuoles. However, increase in autophagic vacuoles (or LC3-II) does not necessarily reflect an increase in autophagic flux&#x02013;it may be a result of a block in the autophagosome degradation step, thus leading to an accumulation of autophagosomes. In addition, overexpression of Myc to non-physiological levels may lead to artefacts and confounding results. Different from their approach and in line with the relevance of Myc inactivation as an anti-neoplastic strategy, we showed that Myc knockdown decreases autophagosome formation. We also elucidated JNK1 and Bcl2 phosphorylation as plausible effectors involved in the regulation of autophagy by Myc suppression, and that this is likely mediated through changes in downstream Bcl2&#x02013;Beclin1 interactions.</p><p>In addition to the plausible pathway that we have characterized in this study, we cannot exclude the possibility that there are other indirect pathways involved as well. Although decrease in ROS is expected to affect other members of the MAPK family, p38 MAPK and ERK were not significantly affected by Myc suppression, perhaps due to other compensatory mechanisms caused by changes in Myc activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDT381C45">45</xref>). Nonetheless, our data indicate that regulations of JNK1 and Bcl2 are key consequences impacting on autophagy that result from Myc inhibition. In conclusion, our data provide mechanistic insights not only into the association between Myc and autophagy, but also into the functional relevance that Myc suppression has in the development of potential cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa cells, HEK293 cells, WT TGR-1 (Myc WT) and c-Myc null HO15.19 (Myc &#x02212;/&#x02212;) rat fibroblast cell lines (generous gift of J.M.

To assay for p62 clearance, cells were seeded in 12-well plates and the next day, they were labelled with a diAcFam-conjugated fluorescent HaloTag ligand (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Labelled cells were subsequently treated with Myc-I (60 &#x000b5;<sc>m</sc>) or DMSO as a control for 16 h before being harvested as described above and subjected to SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Gels were scanned and fluorescence was measured with a Typhoon 8600 imager. For quantification of total protein loading, Krypton Flourescent Protein Stain (Pierce) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence levels were quantified by densitometric analysis using Image J software.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Dendra-tau clearance assay</title><p>Dendra-tau was transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h, Dendra-tau was either photoconverted from green to red by exposure of cells to a 405 nm LED light source (constructed in-house) for 2 min or left unconverted (as controls). Both converted and unconverted cells were subjected to control or Myc siRNA knockdown for 48 h before being fixed and analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACs) for Dendra-tau levels. The red fluorescent signal was assessed at excitation and emission wavelengths of 561/586 using a FACS analysis BD LSR Fortessa cell analyser (BD Biosciences). For compound treatment, cells were similarly photoconverted prior to treatment with the various drugs for 16 h before being analysed by FACS.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Cells collected for immunoprecipitation (IP) study were lysed in Buffer A (20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4, 2 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub><monospace>2</monospace></sub>, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 5 m<sc>m</sc> NaF, 1 m<sc>m</sc> Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) for 20 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 13 000<italic>g</italic> for 15 min. Cell lysates were incubated with an anti-Beclin 1 antibody (Cell Signalling) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and subsequently with Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Products of IP were boiled in Laemmli buffer and analysed by western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>ROS assay</title><p>HeLa cells were monitored for intracellular ROS generation using a peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2&#x02032;, 7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Carboxy-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA); or mitochondrial superoxide sensitive dye, MitoSOX&#x02122;. After 72 h of siRNA knockdown, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with phenol red-free complete medium (Gibco) containing 20 &#x000b5;<sc>m</sc> carboxy-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA for 20 min or 5 &#x000b5;<sc>m</sc> MitoSOX&#x02122; red (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, cells were harvested with trypsin and washed twice with phenol red-free medium. Following this, they were resuspended in phenol red-free medium. The fluorescent signal was assessed at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488/530 using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, California, USA) for carboxy-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA and using a BD LSR Fortessa cell analyser (BD Biosciences) for MitoSOX&#x02122; red. At least 10 000 cells were measured for each sample. Data were analysed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.) and presented as the geometric mean of green fluorescence for carboxy-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA or red signal for MitoSOX&#x02122; red.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>Cell viability was determined by using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 &#x000b5;l of Cell Titer-Glo reagent was added to cells grown in 100 &#x000b5;l of culture medium in a 96-well plate. The contents were mixed on a shaker for 5 min and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Luminescence was then measured with a GloMax luminometer (Promega).</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Immunoblots were quantified by densitometric analysis with the Image J program (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</uri>, 1997&#x02013;2005).
