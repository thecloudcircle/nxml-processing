Here, we performed simultaneous neuronal recordings in the frontal cortex and dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus, CN) during the production of echolocation pulses and communication calls in bats. This approach allowed us to assess the general aspects underlying vocal production in mammals and the unique evolutionary adaptations of bat echolocation. Our data indicate that before vocalization, a distinctive change in high-gamma and beta oscillations (50&#x02013;80 Hz and 12&#x02013;30 Hz, respectively) takes place in the bat frontal cortex and dorsal striatum. Such precise fine-tuning of neural oscillations could allow animals to selectively activate motor programs required for the production of either echolocation or communication vocalizations. Moreover, the functional coupling between frontal and striatal areas, occurring in the theta oscillatory band (4&#x02013;8 Hz), differs markedly at the millisecond level, depending on whether the animals are in a navigational mode (that is, emitting echolocation pulses) or in a social communication mode (emitting communication calls). Overall, this study indicates that fronto-striatal oscillations could provide a neural correlate for vocal control in bats.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In bats, rhythmic activity in frontal and striatal areas of the brain provide a neural correlate for vocal control, which can be used to predict whether the ensuing vocalizations are for echolocation or social communication.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>275755787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9277-2339</contrib-id><name><surname>Hechavarr&#x000ed;a</surname><given-names>Julio C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The project was conducted with funds provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG) to JCH (grant #275755787).

Yet, the neural circuits involved in vocal production have not been clearly delineated. Cortico-striatal networks have been identified as candidate circuits determining vocal output in mammals. Rhythmic neural activity (also known as oscillations) in striatal structures such as the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens has been linked to speech production in healthy humans, to disorders such as stuttering [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and to diseases that involve speech impairments such as Parkinson disease and Tourette syndrome [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Yet, to date, it remains largely discussed how (and if) oscillations in neural networks involving the striatum participate in the precise control of vocal motor outputs in humans and other vertebrate species.</p><p>In this article, we studied neural activity in the dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus, CN) and frontal cortex during vocalization in bats. We chose to study the fronto-striatal circuit because there is strong evidence suggesting a role of this network in vocal production across vertebrate species. Fronto-striatal networks connect different parts of the frontal lobe with various regions of the striatum, which constitute a major input structure into the basal ganglia [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Using tractographic methods, a direct connection between the CN and the prefrontal cortex has been identified in humans and other mammals [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both brain regions are highly connected to brain areas of the canonical vocal motor pathway. For example, in primates, the CN receives inputs from the laryngeal motor cortex [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is also known that the frontal cortex is connected to structures participating in vocal control, such as the periaqueductal gray in the brainstem [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, studies examining the function of frontal and striatal regions have identified their putative role in vocalization in humans [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and bats [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Likewise, in songbirds, Area X (the bird striatum) appears to be involved in vocal learning and in modulating song production in adult animals [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Together these studies support the involvement of frontal and striatal areas in mediating and predicting vocal output across vertebrate species.</p><p>To assess the neural dynamics during vocalization, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity during the production of echolocation pulses and communication calls in bats. LFPs reflect the sum of synaptic activity in neuronal populations and slow spike components, and they represent a correlate of signals obtained with noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We focused on investigating synchronized neural oscillations occurring in the LFPs before and after vocal production. Oscillations are thought to enable communication between neural populations and, at least in humans and birds, they are known to be related to vocal production [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Neural oscillations can be split into different frequency bands comprising delta (1&#x02013;3 Hz), theta (4&#x02013;8 Hz), alpha (8&#x02013;12 Hz), beta (12&#x02013;30 Hz), and gamma (30&#x02013;80 Hz). Empirical evidence indicates that LFP oscillations with different frequencies correlate well with distinct neural computations, motor control, and cognitive states [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In particular, low frequencies such as theta and alpha are known to modulate sensory processing, action selection and neuronal excitability; are implicated in cognitive control; and are involved in long-range synchrony facilitating, e.g., top-down processing [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Beta band oscillations potentially hold functions in perception, memory, and sensory processing [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; are linked to motor actions in the motor cortex and striatum [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; and are dysregulated in disorders such as Parkinson disease [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Gamma rhythms can be linked to selective attention, (local) neural computation, and motor control [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and are correlated with vocalization production [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In humans, distinct oscillatory patterns and coherence across frequency bands have been found during speech production and singing [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>We studied neural oscillatory activity during vocal production in bats of the species <italic>Carollia perspicillata</italic>. This bat species belongs to the suborder Microchiroptera, which are characterized by laryngeal echolocation, similar to human laryngeal-based speech production [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As bats heavily depend on their ability to vocalize in order to communicate and orient in the environment, they serve as a good animal model for studying the neural underpinnings of hearing and vocal production. Bat calls can be broadly split into two types of outputs, including echolocation pulses and communication calls such as distress and social calls (here classified as echolocation pulses versus communication calls) [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. At the level of the brainstem, it is has been demonstrated that the two types of vocal outputs are distinctly controlled [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, whether differences exist in the neural activity patterns leading to the production of both types of vocal outputs on a cortical/cortico-striatal level in bats is unknown. So far, only a very limited number of experiments were able to obtain electrophysiological recordings from vocalizing bats [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], even though the brain of these animals has been studied for over 50 years.</p><p>In bats, an elevated <italic>c-fos</italic> immunoreactivity was found in the CN of the striatum when comparing vocally active with silent animals [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the striatal neural activity patterns related to vocal production remain unknown. The bat frontal lobe is also a rather unexplored region. Most previous experiments in bat frontal areas evaluated the auditory responsiveness of the frontal cortex and defined the frontal auditory field (FAF) [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It remains controversial whether the FAF is an analogue to the prefrontal areas found in other mammals based on morphology and connectivity [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This work will refer to the FAF when discussing the recordings from the bats&#x02019; frontal lobe.</p><p>We hypothesized that the production of echolocation pulses and communication calls in bats could involve different fronto-striatal oscillatory dynamics. Echolocation and communication sounds have different purposes: the former are used to create an acoustic image of the environment (which depends on listening to echoes of the calls emitted), while the latter are uttered to convey information to other individuals. As neural oscillations have been demonstrated to be involved in a multitude of tasks (see above) and are altered in movement/speech disorders, we thought they could provide a neural correlate of vocal production. Our results show that fronto-striatal oscillations can be used to predict vocal output in bats. Vocal production correlates well with distinct inter-areal coupling in the theta band and specialized intra-areal processing mechanisms in the gamma and beta bands of LFPs. Taken together, our results present correlative evidence for the involvement of fronto-striatal circuits in motor action-pattern selection to produce different vocal outputs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>To assess fronto-striatal network activity during vocalization, 47 extracellular, paired recordings were acquired from the FAF and the CN of the dorsal striatum of four male bats. Striatal recordings were performed with linear tetrodes (electrode spacing: 200 &#x003bc;m), while FAF activity was measured with linear 16-channel probes (electrode spacing: 50 &#x003bc;m). The placement of chronically implanted tetrodes in the CN was confirmed histologically for each animal (see example Nissl section in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The laminar probe used for FAF measurements was introduced on each recording day. Throughout the manuscript, we will refer to different frequency bands of the LFP as theta (4&#x02013;8 Hz), alpha (8&#x02013;12 Hz), low beta (12&#x02013;20 Hz), high beta (20&#x02013;30 Hz), low gamma (30&#x02013;50 Hz), and high gamma (50&#x02013;80 Hz).</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Properties of bat vocalizations</title><p>Individual bats were placed in an acoustically and electrically isolated chamber and allowed to vocalize spontaneously while neural activity in the CN and FAF were simultaneously measured.

The main criterion used for classifying sounds into echolocation and communication was based on their spectro-temporal structure. It is known that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>perspicillata&#x02019;s</italic> echolocation pulses are short (&#x0003c;2 ms) downward frequency modulated and peak at high frequencies &#x0003e;50 kHz (see example spectrogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]), while communication calls cover a wider range of sound durations and contain most energy at lower frequencies, generally below 50 kHz (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref> and [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]).</p><p>In our dataset, at the population level, call duration of both types of isolated vocalizations did not differ statistically (<italic>p</italic> = 0.56, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; the test considered only the temporally isolated calls used for further analysis) with a median around 0.33 ms in both cases and IQR values of &#x000b1;1.73 ms for communication and &#x000b1;1.23 ms for echolocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). As expected, peak frequency differed significantly between the two call types (echolocation, 72 kHz &#x000b1; 30 kHz, and communication, 14.0 kHz &#x000b1; 6 kHz, rank-sum test <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). In the echolocation category, differences in peak frequency across calls could be due to interindividual variability in sonar pulse design and to the use of different echolocation harmonics even by the same bat. Differences between echolocation and communication calls reported here were also evident in median spectra calculated considering all calls from each call type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). As frequency was used as the main distinctive feature for characterizing the two call classes, the results described in the preceding text constitute a proof-of-principle.</p><p>Communication calls were further subdivided into those that contained pronounced power only at low frequencies (&#x0003c;50 kHz, &#x0201c;LF&#x0201d; communication calls, <italic>n</italic> = 319) and those that contained pronounced energy at both low and high frequencies (&#x0201c;LHF&#x0201d; communication calls, <italic>n</italic> = 309, see call examples and median spectra of both communication call groups in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This classification of communication calls considers only the spectral structure of the sounds but does not provide information about the function of the calls uttered. The communication call category considered in this manuscript covers a broad range of vocalizations, and it might include different sound types.</p><p>Besides neural recordings during spontaneous vocalization, bats were presented with pure tones (10&#x02013;90 kHz in steps of 5 kHz at a 60-dB sound pressure level [SPL] with a 10-ms duration) to evaluate auditory responsiveness in the neural populations recorded (see frequency tuning results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

Note that a preference towards low-frequency sounds does not necessarily imply a lack of responses to natural high-frequency sounds such as echolocation calls (see below). Within columns of the FAF, channels located at depths below 400 &#x003bc;m showed the highest auditory responsiveness, and neighboring channels had similar frequency tuning properties (see comparison of frequency tuning curves across cortical layers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s003">S3E Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Correlating LFP oscillations with vocal output</title><p>LFPs occurring 500 ms before and after call onset were analyzed to gain insights into the involvement of fronto-striatal regions in vocalization.

Briefly, the <italic>d</italic>-metric describes the effect size of group comparisons and ranges from &#x02212;1 to 1, with identical groups rendering values around zero [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This measure was designed for nonparametric tests (in contrast to Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>), and it quantifies how often values in one distribution are larger than values in a second distribution.</p><p>Cliff&#x02019;s Delta matrices revealed higher power in the gamma range of the LFP (especially frequencies &#x0003e;70 Hz) before communication call production in relation to the time before emission of echolocation pulses (blue areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Differences in the gamma range prior to vocalization had a medium size effect (gray contour lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) following values proposed in previous studies [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In contrast, power in the beta range (12&#x02013;30 Hz) was found to be more pronounced before and during echolocation than during communication emission. Both effects observed suggest that the power in distinct striatal LFP frequencies can be correlated with the production of different types of vocalization (beta is higher for echolocation, and gamma for communication).

To test this possibility, spectral analyses were performed comparing LFPs recorded during the emission of communication calls with low- and high-frequency components (LHF calls) versus echolocation calls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

In bats, differences related to the production and processing of different types of vocalizations encompass neural oscillations in the theta, beta, and gamma bands. This study presents only correlative evidence linking vocal production to neural oscillations in the fronto-striatal network. The latter does not imply a causal role of neural oscillations in vocal control.</p><p>Neural oscillations are a generalized phenomenon in the nervous system, and they have been studied extensively in past years (for reviews see [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). The current consensus is that oscillations represent different excitability states in neural populations. Oscillatory activity differs across brain structures and it participates in processes such as inter-areal synchronization, local information binding, selective attention, and memory formation, among others [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The neural mechanisms by which oscillations are generated in the brain are still under debate. At least gamma oscillations observed in the neocortex and hippocampus seem to originate from an interplay between excitatory and inhibitory activity in pyramidal cells and interneurons (&#x0201c;pyramidal-interneuron gamma&#x0201d; [PING] networks, for review see [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]). It has been postulated that oscillations in other frequency bands could also be linked to pyramidal-interneuron networks (PIN) that oscillate with different time constants (see for example the PIN-theta networks proposed for the auditory cortex [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). Low-frequency oscillations (i.e., alpha and theta) also have been linked to pace-making pyramidal neurons, although it is not clear if the underlying mechanism for pace-making relates to pyramidal-interneuron networks as well [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In humans, beta oscillations found in the striatum also seem to involve inhibitory interactions between neurons [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. With our current data, we cannot assess the cellular mechanisms responsible for the oscillations observed in the bat striatum and frontal cortex during vocalization. Regardless of the cellular origin of fronto-striatal oscillations, our data show that, at least in bats, neural rhythms in these two structures correlate well with vocal output.</p><p>In the present study, we focused on analyzing oscillatory activity related to vocalizations that were surrounded by silent periods to avoid possible confounds related to the production of call trains (except in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, where calls with contaminated post-vocalization times were used as control for the prediction analysis). We reasoned that situations in which bats produced vocalization trains with mixtures of echolocation and communication calls could render misleading results. Future studies could assess whether pre-vocalization activity carries information about the physical parameters of vocalization trains.</p><p>Overall, the observed electrophysiological effects during communication call production need to be considered cautiously. Bats produce communication calls in numerous situations such as, e.g., distress calling, courtship, and territorial disputes, among others [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The most common way to parse communication calls into different subcategories is to score the behavior/context during which the calls are produced [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. As we recorded in head-fixed animals, it is difficult to assess what type of communication calls were broadcasted. Pooling vocalization trials from many types of communication calls together could potentially hide call-specific effects.</p><p>Based on spectro-temporal features, we identified two types of communication vocalizations (containing either only low-frequency or high- and low-frequency components, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Even communication calls containing pronounced power at high frequency differed markedly from echolocation vocalizations. The latter indicates that differences observed in terms of LFP spectral structure and inter-areal coupling are not related solely to the absence/presence of high frequencies in the sounds uttered. Note that we cannot discard that communication calls containing only high frequencies involve LFP patterns similar to those observed during echolocation. Communication calls carrying only high frequencies were not observed in our dataset, but <italic>C</italic>. <italic>perspicillata</italic> produces such calls in contexts such as mating [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Theta oscillations for inter-areal coupling in the fronto-striatal circuit</title><p>According to our data, in bats, vocal production is linked to activity in the theta, beta, and gamma bands of LFPs. The production of communication calls and echolocation pulses rendered power in the theta range after vocalization (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g004">Fig 4A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, across-depths data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g004">Fig 4M</xref>) as well as vocalization dependent inter-areal coherence patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Power differences after call onset also occurred in the beta and gamma range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g004">Fig 4N and 4O</xref>). The time period after vocal production must be examined carefully, as the calls produced could differ in their acoustic attributes (i.e., frequency composition and duration, among others), which could lead to differences in call-evoked neural responses. In different sensory cortices, low frequencies such as theta and alpha are known to modulate sensory processing and enable sensory selection [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Unlike sensory cortices, low-frequency oscillations in frontal areas are less understood in terms of sensory processing.</p><p>Our data suggest that low-frequency rhythms in frontal areas (especially theta, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g007">Fig 7</xref>) relate to inter-areal communication between FAF superficial layers and the dorsal striatum during vocalization, as quantified by computing inter-areal LFP coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This result falls in line with a putative involvement of low-frequency oscillations in long-range synchrony [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The FAF constitutes a nonclassical sensory area, and its laminar structure (i.e., location of inputs and outputs, such as layer 4 and 5 in sensory cortices [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]) needs further anatomical exploration.</p><p>According to our data, FAF layers could hold a crucial role in oscillatory communication between frontal and striatal regions during vocalization initiation. When assessing the coupling between fronto-striatal regions, the timing of inter-areal coherence seems to play an important role when planning and producing different types of sounds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). While the highest level of coherence was found before, during, or shortly after (&#x0003c;250 ms) communication call production, echolocation-related coherence occurred at least 250 ms after pulse onset. One possible explanation for the strong coherence following echolocation pulses could be that the latter require a more thorough sensory processing and auditory feedback after vocal production (i.e., for echo evaluation) than communication calls. Such post-processing of echolocation pulses could be relevant for planning ensuing vocal actions and for a coherent representation of the environment in bats. Note that the inter-areal coherence results presented in this paper have implications beyond bat echolocation, as they suggest that temporally precise oscillatory coupling in the fronto-striatal circuit correlates with the production of different vocal outputs. Such fine communication synchrony between brain structures could be affected in conditions such as Parkinson, Huntington disease, and Asperger syndrome, in which fronto-striatal impairments have been described [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Intra-areal beta and gamma oscillations provide neural correlates of vocal output</title><p>Differences in LFP activity preceding vocal production also occurred in the beta band. According to our data in bats, the beta band of LFPs is differentially involved in echolocation pulse and communication call emission. Beta power is highest during echolocation production in the CN and in superficial layers of the FAF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As especially the beta band activity is correlated with motor action planning and performance [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], one could hypothesize that the strength of beta oscillations in the CN and in superficial FAF layers is linked to different sensorimotor programs required for the production and/or post-vocalization evaluation of acoustic signals (i.e., echoes during echolocation). Overall, beta is typically dominant in the motor system, correlating with the maintenance of ongoing sensorimotor cognitive states and endogenous timing processes [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Aberrant beta oscillations (especially in the striatum) are also a key feature of the parkinsonian brain [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Our results together with those from previous studies suggest that beta oscillations within the fronto-striatal path are important for vocal motor output production.</p><p>Another large vocalization type&#x02013;dependent effect was detected in the gamma band. Before echolocation, high power in this frequency band was observed in deep layers of the FAF, whereas before communication, high gamma power was found in the CN. As the power maxima in gamma was reversed across vocalization conditions in both brain structures, it could be suggested that each component of the fronto-striatal path relies on a differential power distribution of high frequencies in order to produce the same vocal output. This could be supported by the fact that in both brain structures, power in the gamma band was the best predictor of vocal output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p>Gamma LFPs also appear to be related to spiking activity. The time periods before both echolocation pulses and communication calls displayed significant phase-locking values in the gamma range across FAF layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g009">Fig 9D and 9F</xref>). The latter suggests a generalized role of gamma-phase coupling preceding vocalization. Spike-phase locking in the gamma range has been demonstrated previously, correlated to vocalization in the sensorimotor nucleus of zebra finches [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Classical functions of gamma rhythms across species are linked to selective attention, cortical computation, and working memory [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In bats, changes in gamma power have been associated with the processing of auditory stimulation in the bat auditory cortex and with social interaction in frontal areas [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Moreover, an increase in gamma power was found in the superior colliculus after the production of clusters of echolocation pulses in freely flying bats [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The latter could relate to the detected rise of gamma power before echolocation in comparison to communication in the FAF (this study), and could indicate the putative importance of gamma rhythms during navigation, whether the animals are freely flying (as in previous studies) or exploring their environment using their biosonar from a fixed location (this study). Note that gamma oscillations were not involved in long-range fronto-striatal communication (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000658.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This finding supports the current view of gamma rhythms being important for local neural computations [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, changes in gamma power linked to a specific motor action have not been described before for the CN. The ventral striatum is known to display a prominent pattern of gamma power during reward ingestion or decision-making [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], but the oscillatory properties of the nuclei that form the dorsal striatum (such as the CN) are less studied. Our results show that not only the FAF but also the gamma power in the CN are correlated with the type of vocal output.</p><p>Taken together, the findings presented in this manuscript indicate that neural oscillations in the gamma and beta bands in fronto-striatal brain regions represent ensuing vocal actions in bats, while oscillations in the theta-alpha range represent the differential sensory processing of the type of call uttered and play a role in long-range inter-areal coupling. Our data suggest that fronto-striatal circuits are an important component of canonical networks underlying vocalization in mammals, and that these circuits could bear key specializations supporting bat echolocation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments described in this article comply with current guidelines and regulations for animal experimentation and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Using macroscopically visible landmarks (e.g., the pseudocentral sulcus and blood vessels), the skull was evenly aligned. With a scalpel blade, a first craniotomy (approximate 2-mm diameter) was made between the sulcus anterior and pseudocentral sulcus for the chronic implantation of a tetrode (Q1-4-5mm-200-177-HQ4_21mm, NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) mounted on a moveable microdrive (dDrive-m, NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI) to ensure mobility of the electrodes. To prevent the electrodes from bending, the tetrode was introduced into the tissue (partial implant with 2.0-mm depth) with an angle of 17&#x000b0; perpendicular to the brain surface under the microscope. Subsequently, the microdrive was fixed to the scalp with a two-component UV-acrylic glue (Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) and dental cement (Paladur, Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) and was placed via a screw (1 full counterclockwise turn = 150 &#x003bc;m) at the target position (in total: &#x0003e;2.1-mm depth). For protection and shielding, a plastic cap covering the implant was glued using UV-acrylic. The connector was permanently attached to the cap. For stability purposes, a custom-made metal rod (2-cm length, 0.1-cm diameter) was fixed to the surface of the bat&#x02019;s skull. The metal post was glued using UV-acrylic and dental cement to the bone and the plastic cap posterior to the tetrode (see sketch in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). All efforts were made to reduce the weight of the implant and the bat health status was carefully monitored throughout the experiments.</p><p>Before starting the recordings, a second craniotomy (2&#x02013;3-mm diameter) rostral to the tetrode between the sulcus anterior and longitudinal fissure above the FAF was implemented using a scalpel blade [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. To record extracellular action potentials and LFPs in the FAF, an acute A16 laminar probe (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) was introduced into the brain on each recording day. After surgery, the animals had at least 48 hours of recovery before starting electrophysiological recordings.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Neurophysiological recordings in vocalizing animals</title><p>All experiments were performed chronically for a maximum of 2 weeks after surgery. Whenever the wounds were handled, local anaesthesia (Ropivacaine 1%, AstraZeneca GmbH, Wedel, Germany) was administered topically. Before starting the electrophysiological recordings, the bat was placed in a custom-made holder with an attached heating blanket (see previous section) in a Faraday chamber. Subsequently, the tetrode was connected via an adaptor (Adpt. CQ4-Omnetics16, NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI) to a micro amplifier (MPA 16, Multichannel Systems MCS GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany). For detecting neural activity in the FAF, the laminar probe was lowered through the craniotomy under the cortical surface using a micro manipulator (piezo manipulator PM101, Science Products GmbH, Hofheim, Germany) with a speed of 50 &#x003bc;m/s. The linear probe spanned cortical depths of 50&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;m below the brain&#x02019;s surface, with channels evenly distributed in 50-&#x003bc;m steps. One silver wire was placed above the dura mater through a third small craniotomy and served as common ground electrode for both the tetrode and the laminar probe. The reference of each electrode array was short-circuited with the respective top recording channel (the electrode closest to the brain surface) to obtain local signals and prevent movement artifacts. Neuronal signals from the striatum and FAF were preamplified and connected via flexible cables to a portable multichannel recording system with integrated AD converter (Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH, model ME32 System, Reutlingen, Germany). The recording was digitized at a sampling frequency of 20 kHz (16-bit precision). For monitoring, visualizing, and storing the data, MC_Rack_Software Version 4.6.2 (Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany) was used.</p><p>For the acquisition of vocal outputs, a microphone (CMPA microphone, Avisoft Bioacustics, Glienicke, Germany) was placed 10 cm in front of the animal. Acoustic recordings were conducted with a sampling rate of 250 kHz. Vocalizations were amplified (gain = 0.5, Avisoft UltraSoundGate 116Hm mobile recording interface system, Glienicke, Germany) and stored in a PC using the Avisoft Recorder Software (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Glienicke, Germany) with 16-bit precision. Offline analysis was conducted to separate vocalizations into echolocation and communication calls based on their spectro-temporal structure.</p><p>In order to synchronize the recording of the vocalization signals and the neurophysiological signals, Matlab-generated triggers (i.e., a sound for acoustic recordings and a TTL pulse for the neural acquisition system) were used to align both recordings. Each recording comprised 3 &#x000d7; 10-minute vocalization experiments, during which bats were let to vocalize at their own volition, with a short break to stimulate vocal production by opening and closing the recording chamber.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Acoustic stimulation</title><p>To estimate the responsiveness of the areas studied to acoustic stimuli, a frequency tuning paradigm was used. Frequency tuning was controlled via a custom-written Matlab software (Math Works, Natick, MA). A stimulation speaker (NeoCD 1.0 Ribbon Tweeter; Fuontek Electronics, Jiaxing, China) was placed 12 cm in front of the animal and pure tones were presented ranging from 10 to 90 kHz in 5-kHz steps (randomized order, repetitions of each pure tone = 30 times) for a duration of 10 ms (0.5-ms rise/fall time) at 60 dB SPL. Following digital-to-analogue conversion using a soundcard (RME Fireface 400, 192 kHz, 24-bit), the generated pure tones were amplified (Rotel power amplifier, model RB-1050, Worthing, United Kingdom) and presented to the bats.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Analysis of LFP data</title><p>The analysis was implemented using custom-written Matlab scripts (MATLAB R2015b, The Math Works, Natick, MA). All vocalizations were assessed offline using the Avisoft SAS Lab Pro software (v.5.2 Avisoft Bioacoustics, Glienicke, Germany). The initial acoustic trigger, communication calls (typical power maximum around 5&#x02013;50 kHz) and echolocation pulses (peaking above 50 kHz, [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]) were manually located, individually labelled, and their timing was exported to Matlab. To evade response contamination by other auditory stimuli, the &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d; communication calls and echolocation pulses were identified, which comprised at least 500 ms without any vocalization prior to and following call production. Spectrograms of the vocalizations were calculated with a frame width of 0.8 ms, a frame shift of 0.05 ms, and a hamming window of 2,048-points length.</p><p>The peak frequency of each call was estimated from the de-noised FFT. De-noising was achieved by subtracting the FFT of the noise floor to the FFT of the call in question (duration of call and noise were matched in each case). Communication calls were split into two groups: one group of communication calls with only high power at low frequencies (&#x0003c;50 Hz, LF calls) and a second group that showed pronounced power in low and high frequencies (&#x0003e;50 kHz, LHF calls). LF and LHF communication calls were classified based on their spectrum; e.g., a call was assigned to the LHF group if the power maximum at frequencies above 50 kHz was at least larger than half the power at frequencies below 50 kHz.</p><p>To investigate LFPs during each calling condition, the electrophysiological signal was filtered between 1 and 90 Hz (second-order Butterworth filter), the line noise removed using the <italic>rmlinesmovingwinc</italic> function of the Chronux toolbox [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], and down-sampled from 20 kHz to 1 kHz. Additionally, the signals were normalized by calculating the z-score at each time point by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation per recording. Z-scoring was conducted across channels for the FAF (to keep amplitude relationships across channels) and for each channel of the CN individually.</p><p>To extract LFP fluctuations linked to vocalization, a randomization procedure was used. This randomization procedure rendered 10,000 communication and echolocation signals for the CN and each recording channel of the FAF. Each randomization trial was obtained by averaging 100 randomly chosen LFPs corresponding to either the communication or echolocation condition. Note that because of extensive averaging, this randomization procedure removes signal components that are not locked to the vocalizations.</p><p>Time-frequency analysis was conducted for each randomization trial using the Chronux function <italic>mtspecgramc</italic> with a 250-ms window size, 0.5-ms time step, and a time-bandwidth product of 2 with 3 tapers. To compute the difference in power during the production of different call types, the logarithmic power spectrogram of the communication condition was subtracted from the logarithm of the power spectrogram obtained during echolocation. Statistical power was evaluated using Cliff&#x02019;s Delta (<italic>d</italic>). This measure ranges between &#x02212;1 and 1, with almost identical observations rendering <italic>d-</italic>values around zero. The <italic>d</italic>-value borders for defining large, medium, and small effect sizes were set to 0.474, 0.333, and 0.147, respectively [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>A binary SVM classifier was used for predicting vocal output using the average spectral signal in each LFP band either before or after vocalization. The SVM classifier was trained (<italic>fitcsvm</italic> function, rbf kernel, Matlab 2015, single training, no standardization, fitting posterior probabilities after model creation) using signals obtained in 10,000 randomization trials (5,000 per vocalization type, see preceding text). SVM models obtained were cross-validated using 10-fold cross-validation. In a second step, labels were swapped in the training set before classification to assess the performance of the models in the absence of reliable training information.</p><p>To evaluate the oscillatory coherence and phase consistency between signals in the striatum and the different cortical depths of the FAF, the Chronux function <italic>cohgramc</italic> with the same parameters used for spectral analysis (see neural spectrogram specifications above) was used. This operation performed coherency calculations between all possible pairs of different channels in the FAF and each channel in the striatum (here, no randomization was used; in other words, we used the LFPs linked to the production of each echolocation and communication trial). Then, the average coherogram obtained between FAF channels and each striatal channel was calculated. For displaying and assessing the strength of coherency, the magnitude of the coherency (&#x0201c;coherence&#x0201d;) was used. Coherence values exceeding the 95th percentile of all coherence values obtained were labelled as significant.</p><p>Using the same pre-processing methods described above (filtering, down-sampling, z-scoring per recording, and demeaning), LFP responses obtained from the frequency tuning paradigm were quantified. The absolute value of the analytical signal (obtained after Hilbert transforming) was used to calculate the instantaneous energy of each recording channel in response to each sound frequency tested. The frequency eliciting the highest amount of energy was labelled as best frequency.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Analysis of spike data</title><p>Spiking activity was acquired by filtering neural signals in the frequency range of 300&#x02013;3,000 Hz (second-order Butterworth filter). Spike detection was performed using the SpyKING CIRCUS toolbox with automatic clustering and a threshold of 5 median absolute deviations using the best spiking template per channel and recording [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. With a bin size of 3 ms, PSTHs were calculated for both brain structures.</p><p>To investigate the relationship between spikes and LFPs, phase-locking values were calculated using the circular statistics toolbox [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. For phase-locking calculations, only the time window before vocalization was considered. The procedure used for calculating phase locking values is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000658.s009">S9 Fig</xref> for one example echolocation trial. After extracting spike times and raw LFPs related to the isolated vocalization trial, the LFP signal was filtered in different frequency bands (e.g., theta [4&#x02013;8 Hz], alpha [8&#x02013;12 Hz], low beta [12&#x02013;20 Hz], high beta [20&#x02013;30 Hz], low gamma [30&#x02013;50 Hz], and high gamma [50&#x02013;80 Hz]). Filtered LFPs were Hilbert-transformed, and their instantaneous phase information was extracted. The phase at which spiking occurred for each LFP frequency band was stored and analyzed using circular statistics (see below).</p><p>Circular distributions of LFP phases at which spiking occurred for each frequency band were compared with random-phase distributions obtained by extracting LFP phases at random time points not related to spiking. To get robust circular spike-phase and random-phase distributions, circular distributions were calculated 10,000 times, with 100 randomly chosen spike-phase and random-phase values included in each randomization trial. Two parameters were extracted from the circular distributions obtained in each spike- and random-phase trial: the distribution&#x02019;s VS (<italic>circ_r</italic> function in the circular statistics toolbox [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]) and its angular mean (<italic>circ_mean</italic> function in the circular statistics toolbox [<xref rid="pbio.3000658.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]). VS values obtained from all randomization trials were used for assessing statistical significance when comparing spike-phase and random-phase distributions using Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Angular mean values were used for visual display and for calculating population VS differences (dVS). In our calculations, positive dVS values indicate higher VS in the spike-phase distribution when compared to the random-phase control.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Histological verification of striatal recordings</title><p>For visualization of the electrode implantation location, histological analysis was performed following the completion of the experiments. To locate the tracks of the chronically implanted tetrode in the striatum, an electric lesion was performed for 10 seconds with 10 &#x003bc;A DC current using a Stimulus Isolator A365 (World Precision Instruments, Friedberg, Germany) under deep anaesthesia prior to perfusion. Electric lesions were set for each animal on the last experimental day on the most ventral and dorsal striatal electrodes. Subsequently, the animals were euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mL sodium pentobarbital (160 mg/mL, Narcoren, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) and transcardially perfused using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec, Wertheim, Germany) with a pressure rate of 3&#x02013;4 mL/minutes. The bats were perfused with 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline for 5 minutes, followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 minutes. After removing the surrounding tissue, muscles, and skull, the brain was carefully eviscerated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4&#x000b0;C for at least one night, and placed in an ascending sucrose sequence solution (1 hour in 10%, 2&#x02013;3 hours in 20%, 1 night in 30%) at 4&#x000b0;C to avoid the formation of ice crystals in the tissue. Subsequently, the brain was frozen in an egg yolk embedding encompassing the fixation in glutaraldehyde (25%) with CO<sub>2</sub>. For sectioning the frozen brain, a cryostat (Leica CM 3050S, Leica Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany) was utilized and coronal slices (50 &#x003bc;m thick) were prepared, mounted on gelatin-coated slides and Nissl stained. In brief, the brain slices were immersed in 96% ethanol overnight and 70% ethanol (5 minutes), hydrated in distilled water (3 &#x000d7; 3 minutes), stained in 0.5% cresylviolet (10 minutes), rinsed in diluted glacial acetic acid (30 seconds), differentiated in 70% ethanol + glacial acetic acid until neuronal somata were still red-violet stained with only faint coloration of the background, fixed in an ascending alcohol sequence (2 &#x000d7; 5 minutes in 96% ethanol, 2 &#x000d7; 5 minutes in 100% isopropyl alcohol), cleaned by Rotihistol I, II, and III solution (Carl-Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and covered with DPX mounting medium. The inspection of the lesion was facilitated by a bright-field, fluorescence microscope (Keyence BZ-9000, Neu-Isenburg, Germany).

The manuscript focuses on comparing neural activity across two different types of vocalizations, echolocation calls versus communication calls. The LFPs are characterized and segregated by frequency into low (theta), medium (beta) and high (gamma) band activity. The study provides solid evidence of a functional interaction between neuronal activity patterns in frontal cortex and striatum, and found that activity patterns were different between the two types of vocalizations. Overall, the study is original, creative and the results are interesting. The presence of coherent premotor neural activity patterns in the frontal cortex and striatum preceding vocalizing is especially important since the role of the basal ganglia in non-human mammalian vocalizations remains poorly understood. The differences in the post-vocalization activity, which appears auditory in origin, are also quite intriguing.</p><p>My main criticism of the manuscript is that the hypothesis is not well justified, and the rationale for the study and its interpretation is vague and confusing. Most of the references cited in the introduction to build the rationale come from human speech and primate communication studies (3-14), with very little support for the presence of analogous brain networks in bats or other mammals (or songbirds). The stated hypothesis (Intro, 4th paragraph) is that the production of echolocation and non-echolocation (communication) calls could involve different fronto-striatal oscillatory dynamics. Predicting that the rhythms might be different during different behaviors isn&#x02019;t a very satisfying test of the hypothesis unless the experiments is designed to reveal something specific about the underlying mechanism. The potential significance of different oscillatory frequencies or states for cognition and motor control is only generally addressed, and consequently the interpretation lacks any sense of mechanism. What seems to be absent is a cogent connection between corticostriatal oscillatory network activities and the mammalian (vocal) motor pathways. Without this, it is difficult to evaluate the significance of these results.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>Intro page 2, line 5: what is the &#x0201c;hearing-action cycle&#x0201d;?</p><p> Line 7: distress and social calls are communication calls. Why use the term non-echolocation rather than communication throughout the paper? </p><p>Results, 2nd paragraph: For data analysis it makes sense to focus on utterances surrounded by a +/- 500 ms time window of silence, but wouldn&#x02019;t this exclude normal echolocation behavior in which calls emitted in rapid trains? Don&#x02019;t bats normally emit echolocation calls more frequently than once per second? </p><p>Why did the bats emit communication calls if they were all alone in the recording chamber? Was there a method for evoking calls?</p><p>Results, 4th paragraph: The acoustic responses are puzzling. Line 5 says LFPs in both regions revealed a preference towards low frequencies (i.e those characteristic of the communication calls). If these neuronal populations weren&#x02019;t very responsive to the echolocation call frequencies, why would they be involved in echolocation call generation? </p><p>Page 8, first line: the observed effects would seem to support only a correlation between LFP frequencies and different vocalizations. A functional or causal role doesn&#x02019;t seem to be supported yet.</p><p>Discussion, 2nd paragraph. Much of the discussion, but especially this paragraph (lines 9-19) seem highly speculative to me.</p><p>Page 14, line 19: &#x0201c;One possible explanation could be that echolocation calls require a more thorough sensory processing after vocal production than non-echolocation calls&#x0201d;. This would seem to go without saying, but it doesn&#x02019;t really explain why there wasn&#x02019;t an auditory response to the self-heard communication calls. Were there auditory responses to the acoustic stimuli, but no auditory responses during the communication call utterances? </p><p>Page 16, line 7: The results don&#x02019;t fully support the conclusion that neural activity patterns in FAF or CN can &#x0201c;represent future vocal outputs&#x0201d;, only that there is a correlation between network activity patterns and broad categories of vocal output, which may or may not be directly affiliated with motor control.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>General summary: Understanding the neural circuits underlying the production of vocal signals is an important endeavor, especially because humans are so reliant on speech and language for communication. In this study, Weineck et al. record neural activity in the frontal cortex and striatum in bats producing echolocation and non-echolocation calls. They find that neural activity and patterns of coherence in and between these brain areas varies between echolocation and non-echolocation calls. These are novel findings that have implications for the control of communication. </p><p>Major comments:</p><p>It is important for readers to fully understand the extent of acoustic differences between echolocation (E) and non-echolocation (NE) calls included in their analyses. In this respect, it will be very important for the authors to depict, on the same figure, E and NE calls using both duration and peak frequency (2-D image). Based on the histograms, there is considerable overlap in both duration and peak frequencies, but these vocalizations could appear more distinct if each call is depicted using both features. One could also include frequency modulation as a third feature to help distinguish between E and NE calls.</p><p>Overall, the NE class of vocalizations is quite broad. The authors note in the Introduction that NE calls include communication, distress and social calls. It is unclear how acoustically distinct these types of NE calls are, or to what extent the NE calls in the analyses reflect these different types of NE calls. Given the differences between E and NE calls, it is possible that different types of NE calls are driven by different patterns of activity and coherence in the brain. Therefore, it seems important for the authors to parse their dataset of NE calls into different types of communication signals. One could also image it being interesting to assess the degree to which variation in signal properties within NE (and E) calls are related to LFP activity. At minimum, the authors should discuss the range of NE calls produced, the possibility of multiple types of NE calls emitted by the bats, and the limitations of their interpretations given the range of NE calls that could have been emitted during neurophysiological recordings. </p><p>Related to this point, the authors should comment on the range of peak frequencies observed in E calls. The range seems quite large and it is important for a broad audience to understand the extent of this variation. </p><p>One of the most consistent results in their paper is that many changes in neural activity and coherence are found after vocalizations. The authors explicitly acknowledge the prevalence of these results and suggest that these neural changes reflect processing of auditory feedback. While understanding the nature of auditory responses outside the context of vocalization is distinct from understanding the nature of auditory feedback processing, it would be very informative for the authors to conduct the same level of analyses of their data on auditory responses (e.g., LFP deflections, oscillations, coherence). This is useful even if the authors did not present a stimulus set that reflected the range of vocalizations emitted by bats. (If there are limitations on space, the authors could move much of the machine learning results to the Supplementary Information.)</p><p>The Introduction should provide more information on the potential importance of rhythms and coherence for action selection. I think much of the details about coherence and rhythms that is currently in the Discussion section should be moved to the Introduction. This will allow the reader to process the many types of data in the Results section.</p><p>The authors have plenty of additional data to analyze, since their (sensible) criteria for call selection dramatically winnowed down the number of calls for analysis. However, given their emphasis on elucidate neural activity that could lead to call production, it would be useful to independently analyze the data for echolocation and non-echolocation calls that were preceded by 500 ms of silence but did not have to be followed by 500 ms of silence. I think this would be a very useful dataset to test the robustness of their findings. </p><p>The timing of the increase in LFP signals for echolocation calls is very late for auditory processing of a fast signal for detection objects in the world (Figure 2d). And the peak in coherence between the FAF and CN is even later, making it even less likely to be involved in auditory processing. The latency is also longer than that observed for auditory response to pure tones (Supplementary Figure 2). Please respond to this. </p><p>Minor comments: </p><p>One of the difficulties in trying to digest this paper is the large number of analyses (e.g., different frequency bands at different depths in the FAF with different vocalization types, coherence at different frequencies and depths across brain areas). It is difficult to keep everything in perspective, to know what is important. The Discussion and the graphical abstract do a pretty good job summarizing the data.</p><p>p. 7, first para, last sentence: since the increase in neural activity BEFORE the vocalization is not significant, this statement should be removed.</p><p>Section on SVM classifier is neat but think can be moved to supplementary information section for create space for additional analyses (see Major Comments). I also think the section on the relationship between spiking activity and the LFP is interesting, but see it as secondary to the main point of the paper; so this section too could be moved to the supplementary material (or streamlined substantially).</p><p>Figure 5. Why have two different depictions of accuracy across CN and FAF? Why not depict the data for CN as a heat map and add as a row onto the heatmap for FAF? Would save space and reduce the amount of work that readers have to do.</p><p>Please explain why opening and closing the recording chamber stimulated vocal production.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[identifies himself as Jagmeet S. Kanwal]</p><p>This study reports interesting and novel findings on the role of oscillations for production and perception of vocalizations in bats. These results are significant given our lack of understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying vocal control. The role of oscillations in neural activity during social communication is an active area of inquiry and this study extends recent findings. While the oscillations are interesting, their correlation with vocal production does not inform us of the causal mechanisms and circuit design. Nevertheless, the findings reported here could pave the way forward. </p><p>Technically, the study is well designed and executed on an important animal model in this field. </p><p>Data appear to be carefully analyzed in detail and all figures are generally well organized, but the writing of the paper can be improved, including proper use of terminology. One main point that stands out is that social vocalizations predominantly have low frequencies, whereas echolocation vocalizations are stereotypically high frequency. Therefore, the differences in neural oscillations may be directly related to the dominant frequency in vocalizations and only secondarily to the fact that one set is being used for navigation while the other is used for social communication. For a clear distinction into two functional types, it is essential to compare social vocalizations that have high frequencies within them with echolocation vocalizations. Until this is done, the differences in neural oscillations correlated with each type of output cannot be classified as relating to social versus navigational (echolocation). The authors may be able to parse out their social vocalization data to clarify this issue.</p><p>Alternatively, the distinction between neural oscillations can be related to predominant frequency within a vocalization, which may very well be the case. </p><p>Since different types of intra- and into inter-areal oscillations are discussed, to help the reader, please summarize results in a table where the function and/or presence/location of each type of oscillation and its relationship to communicaton/echolocation or high/low frequency vocalization is listed.</p><p>Also, it is important to be clear that the reader does not think that neural oscillations play a direct role in vocal control; the neural oscillations are temporally correlated with different types of vocal output. With regard to this, it will be useful to include a paragraph or section in the discussion about the origin of different types of oscillations in the brain in relation to this study (perhaps, expand on supplementary figure 9?). For example, high gamma oscillations are thought to result from the interaction of fast-spiking inhibitory with excitatory neurons within local neural circuits.</p><p>Also, oscillations observed in one region of the brain can originate elsewhere since they reflect synaptic activity. This can have a bearing on the proposed fronto-striatal connectivity. </p><p>Specific corrections:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>First line: Change "&#x02026; networks leading to vocalization production remain&#x02026;" to "&#x02026; networks underlying vocal control remain&#x02026;"</p><p>Change "... allows to assess the ...

This is confusing. Better to have clear separation and consistently use "echolocation pulses or vocalizations". Non-echolocation vocalizations should instead clearly refer to "social calls". Distress calls also fall under the category of social calls. These are the only two well-recognized types of vocalizations. Non-echolocation calls is a functionally diffuse category. </p><p>P. 7: Please briefly indicate the importance of Cliff's delta metric and why it was used here to compare effect size.</p><p>Change to: "&#x02026; before call production compared to before emission of echolocation pulses&#x02026;" </p><p>Last sentence on page 11 is not clear.</p><p>Not clear why the phase of LFPs in the FAF is compared to its relationship to striatal spiking. Please explain. Also, it is not clear why changes in spiking probability were not observed in response to vocalizations.

<named-content content-type="letter-date">20 Jan 2020</named-content>
</p><p>Dear Dr Hechavarria,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised Research Article entitled "Neural oscillations in the fronto-striatal network predict vocal output in bats" for publication in PLOS Biology. I have now obtained advice from two of the original reviewers and have discussed their comments with the Academic Editor. </p><p>We're delighted to let you know that we're now editorially satisfied with your manuscript. However before we can formally accept your paper and consider it "in press", we also need to ensure that your article conforms to our guidelines. A member of our team will be in touch shortly with a set of requests. As we can't proceed until these requirements are met, your swift response will help prevent delays to publication. Please also make sure to address the data and other policy-related requests noted at the end of this email.</p><p>*Copyediting*</p><p>Upon acceptance of your article, your final files will be copyedited and typeset into the final PDF. While you will have an opportunity to review these files as proofs, PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling or significant scientific errors. Therefore, please take this final revision time to assess and make any remaining major changes to your manuscript.</p><p>NOTE: If Supporting Information files are included with your article, note that these are not copyedited and will be published as they are submitted. Please ensure that these files are legible and of high quality (at least 300 dpi) in an easily accessible file format. For this reason, please be aware that any references listed in an SI file will not be indexed. For more information, see our Supporting Information guidelines:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/supporting-information">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/supporting-information</ext-link>
</p><p>*Published Peer Review History*</p><p>Please note that you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out. Please see here for more details:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/</ext-link></p><p>*Early Version*</p><p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p><p>*Protocols deposition*</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods</ext-link>

</p><p>Note that we do not require all raw data. Rather, we ask that all individual quantitative observations that underlie the data summarized in the figures and results of your paper be made available in one of the following forms:</p><p>1) Supplementary files (e.g., excel). Please ensure that all data files are uploaded as 'Supporting Information' and are invariably referred to (in the manuscript, figure legends, and the Description field when uploading your files) using the following format verbatim: S1 Data, S2 Data, etc. Multiple panels of a single or even several figures can be included as multiple sheets in one excel file that is saved using exactly the following convention: S1_Data.xlsx (using an underscore).</p><p>2) Deposition in a publicly available repository. Please also provide the accession code or a reviewer link so that we may view your data before publication. </p><p>Regardless of the method selected, please ensure that you provide the individual numerical values that underlie the summary data displayed in the following figure panels as they are essential for readers to assess your analysis and to reproduce it: Figs 1-9, S2-S8, S10, S11. NOTE: the numerical data provided should include all replicates AND the way in which the plotted mean and errors were derived (it should not present only the mean/average values).</p><p>Please also ensure that figure legends in your manuscript include information on where the underlying data can be found, and ensure your supplemental data file/s has a legend.</p><p>Please ensure that your Data Statement in the submission system accurately describes where your data can be found.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>REVIEWERS' COMMENTS:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I like the changes to the introduction and discussion. Even though I'm still not sure how these oscillations relate to motor output or decision making, I'm convinced that the manuscript has addressed this issue to the best that it can be handled with current knowledge. The revision has a clearer picture of the hypothesis and goals, and the discussion is more coherent and understandable. I am satisfied that the revisions have addressed my earlier concerns and I have no further comments. </p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[identifies himself as Jagmeet S. Kanwal]</p><p>The authors have done an outstanding job of addressing reviewer comments. They conducted additional analyses, created and improved figures and a table as suggested, and rewrote parts of the manuscript and improved terminology. The manuscript reads quite well now and reports some interesting findings and stimulating ideas for further work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pbio.3000658.r005" article-type="author-comment"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000658.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><related-article id="rel-obj005" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3000658" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
