Although the incidence rates vary from the lowest in Asia and Africa to the highest in North America, a dramatic increase of incidence has been observed in Asian countries over recent years, especially in China [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Estradiol is a key promoter for the carcinogenesis of BC, which enhances cell proliferation mainly through an estrogen receptor (ER) &#x003b1; dependent mechanism. ER&#x003b1; mediated estradiol signaling facilitates DNA mutations and the loss of wild type alleles of the tumor suppressor, thereby resulting in cancer development [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These mechanisms suggest a crucial role of ER&#x003b1; in BC carcinogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying the development of ER positive BC still remains unknown.</p><p>Previous studies have identified a large group of microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed among cancer tissues compared to the normal tissues [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Different subtypes [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and highly metastatic BC cells compared to the wild type parental BC cells [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] were also reported. Among these miRNAs, miR-206 is an important ER associated miRNA, which is decreased in ER positive BC compared to the ER negative subtype. Adam et al. identified and validated miR-206 as an ER&#x003b1; negative regulator, and an estradiol activator could inhibit the expression of miR-206 [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several studies also demonstrated that miR-206 was downregulated in ER&#x003b1; positive BC, indicating miR-206 expression is inversely correlated with ER&#x003b1; [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The possible negative feedback loop between miR-206 and ER&#x003b1; implies an important role of miR-206 in ER&#x003b1; positive BC. Tavazoi et al. [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] used microarray analyses to define the inhibitory effects of miR-335 and miR-206 on the migration and invasion of highly metastatic BC cell lines. They showed a decreased median survival in patients whose primary tumors displayed low expression of miR-335 and miR-206, but their study focused on miR-335 and did not further determine the mechanism of miR-206 inhibition of metastasis [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although the relationship between ER&#x003b1; and miR-206 has been reported, no studies have focused on their inhibitory effects for the metastasis of ER positive BC. This subset of BC comprises the majority of newly diagnosed breast cancer. In the current study, we determined the mechanism by which miR-206 regulates the migration and invasion of ER positive BC.</p><p>Three transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; related signaling genes, <italic>NRP1</italic>, <italic>SMAD2</italic>, and <italic>SMAD4</italic>, are predicted as candidate miR-206 downstream targets using bioinformatics analyses. Our data indicated that miR-206 inhibited the expression of these genes, as well as the expression and autocrine activity of TGF-&#x003b2;. These effects could contribute to the migration and invasion of BC cells. Therefore, our results suggest that restoring miR-206 expression may impair the ability of migration and invasion of ER positive BC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>MiR-206 overexpression inhibits migration and invasion of ER positive BC cell lines</title><p>To explore the effects of miR-206 on migration and invasion of ER positive BC, we transfected MCF-7 and T47D cells with pre-miR-206 to overexpress miR-206 in these ER positive breast cancer cell lines (noted as MCF7-miR-206E and T47D-miR-206E).

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first that investigated the mechanism of miR-206 inhibitory effects in ER positive BC cells. We show that epithelial mesenchymal transition is suppressed by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling components.</p><p>Our data showed the inhibitory effects of miR-206 on migration, invasion, and the EMT response. MiR-206 overexpression increased the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin, in ER positive BC cells, while the mesenchymal cell markers, N-cadherin and vimentin, were decreased. As found in mesenchymal cells, the transcription factor ZEB1 was decreased significantly in both the miR-206 overexpressing cell lines, further demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of miR-206 overexpression on EMT may be mediated by suppression of the <italic>ZEB1</italic> gene expression. <italic>ZEB1</italic> suppresses the promoter activity of the E-cadherin gene <italic>CDH1</italic> by binding to the E-box regions of the DNA sequences that flank <italic>CDH1</italic> [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

They belong to the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling gene family, which further suggests that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling may mediate the EMT inhibition caused by miR-206 overexpression. Interestingly, we found both TGF-&#x003b2; transcription level and the TGF-&#x003b2; autocrine production level were downregulated in the miR-206 overexpressing cell lines. We also found that exogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 could promote the migration and invasion capability, which was compromised by miR-206. These results suggest that both the autocrine production of TGF-&#x003b2; from cancer cells and paracrine production from the tumor microenvironment could play important roles in EMT processes. These conclusions are in agreement with the previous findings that higher autocrine TGF-&#x003b2; production was found in the mesenchymal cell subpopulation than in the immortalized parental human mammary epithelial cells, and this increased SMAD expression and stably maintained mesenchymal subpopulation (MSP) cells in a mesenchymal/stem cell state [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previous studies showed an autocrine and paracrine TGF-&#x003b2;/ZEB/miR-200 signaling network that regulates the establishment and maintenance of EMT. According to these studies, the ZEB/miR-200 regulatory loop is targeted by autocrine and paracrine TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, our results showed that the autocrine TGF-&#x003b2; was targeted by miR-206 overexpression, either at the transcriptional or translational level. Although the mechanism underlying this process is still unknown, our results imply a novel regulatory link between autocrine TGF-&#x003b2; and miRNA. These results may provide new insight for future research on miRNAs and their related signaling pathways.</p><p>We found that <italic>NRP1</italic> and <italic>SMAD2</italic> gene expressions were decreased in miR-206 overexpressing cell lines, and further validated the direct target genes of miR-206. SMAD2 is a key signal transducer of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, which generally acts by forming complexes of TGF-&#x003b2; receptor type II (T&#x003b2;RII) and T&#x003b2;RI. The receptor activated SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 combine with SMAD4 to form trimeric SMAD complexes that translocate to the nucleus, where they combine with DNA transcription factors at regulatory gene sequences, and induce the transcription of <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>Snail</italic> genes [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

NRP1 is a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and is an anti-angiogenic target in malignant tumors [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recently, NRP1 has been shown to be a co-receptor of TGF-&#x003b2;, with a high affinity for TGF-&#x003b2; and its receptors. It combines with T&#x003b2;RI/II/III and forms a co-receptor complex, enhancing the affinity of TGF-&#x003b2; for its receptors. As a result, NRP1 might interact with other TGF-&#x003b2; receptors, resulting in TGF-&#x003b2; binding and activation, thereby facilitating cancer metastasis [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>We confirmed that PLD1 was decreased in miR-206 overexpressing cell lines by mRNA profiling assays and qPCR. PLD1 belongs to the PLD enzyme superfamily of proteins, and contains a conserved catalytic site and a functional transphosphatidylase activity, acting at phosphodiester bonds found in a wide range of substrates. Classical PLD enzymes hydrolyze the abundant membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine to yield the second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PLD1 has been reported to play pro-metastatic roles in multiple processes, including induced Ras and ERK activation [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], loss of polarization for epithelial cells [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the release of extracellular proteases that facilitate invasion [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recently, Fite et al. identified miR-182, miR-887, miR-203, and miR-3619 as PLD1/2 targeting miRNAs. Ectopic transfection with these miRNAs could reverse PLD1/2 expression, and cause aggressiveness of post-EMT in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results also showed that PLD1 was regulated by miR-206; therefore, it could contribute to the inhibition of the EMT process. However, the mechanism underpinning this process is still unclear, and additional studies should investigate the exact effect of miR-206 overexpression on PLD1.</p><p>In addition to the effects of miR-206 overexpression shown in our study, other studies have also indicated that miR-206 activates apoptosis by targeting Notch3 [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and inhibits proliferation by repressing KLF4 expression in BC cells [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Whether these miR-206 mediated effects are all modulated by <italic>SMAD2</italic>, <italic>NRP1</italic>, and/or <italic>PLD1</italic> genes is still unknown. Nevertheless, modulation of these genes may be a promising and meaningful approach to determine the mechanism of miR-206, and this process will be investigated in the future.</p><sec id="s3_1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that miR-206 inhibits migration and invasion of ER positive BC cells. We report a novel inhibitory effect of miR-206 on transcription and autocrine production of TGF-&#x003b2;, as well as direct targeting the expression of <italic>SMAD2</italic> and <italic>NRP1</italic> in the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway, In addition, mRNA expression assay shows that miR-206 inhibits the expression of PLD1. All of these effects suppress EMT processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Schematic diagram 1</xref>). These results suggest that miR-206 may be an important tumor suppressor miRNA for ER positive BC. MiR-206 may therefore provide an effective therapeutic strategy for ER positive BC.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Schematic diagram 1</label><caption><title>Possible regulatory mechanism of miR-206 induction of migration and invasion inhibition in ER positive BC cells through the suppression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition by targeting TGF-&#x003b2; signaling components</title><p>MiR-206 overexpression suppresses TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, including the transcription and autocrine expression of TGF-&#x003b2;, and the expression of the <italic>NRP1</italic> and <italic>SMAD2</italic> genes.
