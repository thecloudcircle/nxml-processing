ATP is the source of the cellular energy that fuels all cellular processes including myocardial contraction. PCr is the heart&#x02019;s primary energy reserve, producing ATP from the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) via the creatine kinase (CK) reaction: PCr&#x02009;+&#x02009;ADP&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;=&#x0003e;Cr&#x02009;+&#x02009;ATP, forming creatine (Cr) as a byproduct. The majority of human cardiac <sup>31</sup>P CMRS studies use the PCr/ATP ratio as an index of this cardiac energy reserve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

In addition, the development of fast <sup>31</sup>P saturation-transfer techniques over the past decade have provided measurements of the pseudo first-order kinetic reaction rate, k<sub>f</sub> (in s<sup>-1</sup>) for the CK reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

By combining k<sub>f</sub> and PCr concentration ([PCr]) measurements in the same cardiac <sup>31</sup>P CMRS exam, the forward CK flux of ATP supplied to the heart can be obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Once designed, a neural network can be retuned and retrained as additional data become available, without exhaustively searching for the best classifier. Here, we apply neural-network analysis to test whether a combination of cardiac [PCr], [ATP], k<sub>f</sub> and the CK flux supplying ATP to the heart, as measured noninvasively with <sup>31</sup>P CMRS, can distinguish several common myocardial diseases and their clinical severity. The study includes&#x02013;to the best of our knowledge&#x02013;the entire known data pool of subjects for which complete sets of [PCr], [ATP], k<sub>f</sub> and CK flux measurements exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The work tests the hypothesis that cardiac CK metabolism is altered in patterns that may be specific to different forms of heart disease and/or to the clinical severity of disease, specifically in&#x000a0;HF. If true, cardiac CK metabolic data acquired with <sup>31</sup>P CMRS could be used with a neural network classifier as a metabolic biomarker to gauge disease type and severity. Moreover, the existence of such relationships would link certain common clinical cardiac conditions to compromised CK energy supply in individual patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par36">Complete sets of cardiac [PCr], [ATP], k<sub>f</sub> and CK flux data were obtained from 178 noninvasive cardiac <sup>31</sup>P CMRS saturation transfer studies performed between 1999 and 2011 acquired with the approval of the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Two auto-encoders were chosen to provide flexibility in dimensional reduction, while minimizing over-fitting that can result from either the rigidity of using a single auto-encoder, or the complexity introduced by more layers.

The initial training utilized 166 of the data sets, omitting 12 patients who had both HCM and HF which would interfere with the fellow class of HCM without HF.

Thus the HF data were first classified into three classes: NYHA class I; NYHA classes II plus III combined; and NYHA class IV.

For this, the performance of the first network that was trained to classify the control, HF and non-HF patients using the combined 1.5 and 3&#x02009;T data, was tested separately on the 1.5&#x02009;T and the 3&#x02009;T data sets without retraining.

Each synthetic point was randomly interpolated from one of five nearest-neighbor pairs of each of the three independent parameters, [PCr], [ATP] and k<sub>f</sub>.

Points were added until the disease class-size matched that of the majority training class (HF, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;97).

This suggests that CK metabolic data acquired noninvasively with resting-state cardiac <sup>31</sup>P CMRS, could be used with a neural network classifier as a metabolic biomarker to stratify disease type and severity with clinically-relevant accuracy. Moreover, from a mechanistic standpoint, the fact that a neural network can classify disease based on CK metabolism alone, means that there must exist heretofore unidentified differences in CK metabolism that are specific to disease type and severity which enable the network to do so.</p><p id="Par56">Indeed there was no one unique disease-specific CK-metabolic defect, as evidenced by the incremental effect of successively removing each parameter and retuning the network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Instead, nuanced variations in multiple parameters permitted accurate neural network discrimination. The elimination analysis showed that [PCr] and k<sub>f</sub> were the first and second most important input parameters for classifying heart disease in the neural network (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The pair, [PCr] and k<sub>f</sub>, was better than CK flux alone, but using all three, namely CK flux, k<sub>f</sub>, and [PCr], was better still. This is unexpected because CK flux is not independent, being the product of k<sub>f</sub> and [PCr] as noted earlier. In order for CK flux to add such value as a classifier compared to its component factors, k<sub>f</sub> and [PCr] must vary in a co-dependent way that is exacerbated by disease. This is consistent with the observation that CK flux independently predicted cardiac events whereas individual k<sub>f</sub>, [PCr] (and PCr/ATP) measures alone, did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. [ATP] was the least important parameter for discriminating disease, an observation likely reflecting the tight control of [ATP] that is required to preserve cellular viability. With [ATP] as the &#x02018;last to go&#x02019;, the CK reaction, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and other metabolic pathways apparently make whatever adjustments that are needed to preserve [ATP] and prevent demise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par57">The main limitation of this work is the number of studies, particularly the&#x000a0;NYHA class IV HF, and non-HF HCM and MI sub-categories. Although all extant complete data sets were included, they derive from research studies that were not designed for the specific investigation reported herein. In that respect the study might be considered as blinded compared to the prospective acquisition of data to test a preconceived hypothesis. Unfortunately, the availability of new data to test the potential of this cardiac <sup>31</sup>P CMRS quartet to serve as a metabolic biomarker for clinical disease, is presently limited to the extent that cardiac <sup>31</sup>P MRS is not yet a clinical procedure.</p><p id="Par58">The synthetic augmentation of metabolic data by 2.3-fold for disease type and by 1.7-fold for HF severity using the SMOTE method, provided results that were consistent with the smaller original data sets. This suggests that the overall level of performance realized here should be reasonably representative of what is achievable with the addition of <sup>31</sup>P CMRS data of comparable quality from future studies. Nevertheless, the primary purpose of data augmentation was to balance class-size to avoid over-fitting and/or bias of the neural network towards a majority class. Indeed, its overall effect was to smooth out performance differences between the majority and lesser-sampled classes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> vs. Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), which was the intended purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There is no substitute for original data, especially when the underlying functional inter-relationship between metabolic parameters, disease type and severity is not known. That the successive dropping of metabolic parameters degraded predictive&#x000a0;accuracy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), means that [PCr], [ATP], k<sub>f</sub> and CK flux have to be treated as a parametric quartet. Thus in general, network performance might not be expected to survive simulations that involve independent randomization of the component parameters, at least until the nature of their mechanistic link is better understood. Disease heterogeneity is a potentially confounding factor as hypertrophy, DCM and MI are common co-morbidities that underlie HF. They would therefore be&#x000a0;expected to confound the neural network&#x02019;s ability to distinguish them. In that sense, the accuracy with which the network was able to discriminate disease type as demonstrated here, is quite surprising. Also surprising was its ability to differentiate NYHA class, which involves a degree of subjectivity in clinical assessment. Indeed all of the network&#x02019;s misclassification errors involved sliding into an immediately adjacent NYHA class (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par59">Other potential confounding variables were age and gender differences, and the use of different 1.5 and 3&#x02009;T methodologies among sub-groups of the study population. As can be seen in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the former are fairly minor with the ages of control and HF patients being around 40&#x02013;50&#x02009;years.

Nevertheless, a trend for reduced metabolite concentrations (and probably PCr/ATP) with age over 40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] has been reported elsewhere and should be noted. Regarding methodological differences between the 1.5 and 3&#x02009;T CMRS protocols, the re-analysis of separated 1.5&#x02009;T and 3&#x02009;T data should eliminate any such confounding effects (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Indeed, the ability of the neural network to classify disease based on CK metabolism alone was unimpaired for those diseases for which CK metabolic data were available from both 1.5&#x02009;T and 3&#x02009;T methodologies. These results can only further support the primary conclusion that a neural network can differentiate individual disease type and severity based on CK metabolism alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion and clinical implications</title><p id="Par60">Neural network analysis employing only cardiac CK metabolic parameters can accurately classify cardiac disease and severity, suggesting a role for noninvasive quantitative <sup>31</sup>P CMRS as a metabolic biomarker. In HF, the degree of compromise in CK energy supply as identified by the neural network, predicted the clinical severity of HF symptoms in individual patients. The ability to accurately classify disease based on CK metabolism suggests that altered CK metabolism is an intrinsic and nuanced factor in many common heart diseases. If the relationship between compromised CK metabolism and clinical severity is causal, then therapies that increase CK energy supply could well reduce symptoms and support a role for the CK reaction as a potentially important new therapy target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>3D</term><def><p id="Par6">Three dimensional</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADP</term><def><p id="Par7">Adenosine diphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATP</term><def><p id="Par8">Adenosine triphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par9">Area-under-thecurve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p id="Par10">Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMR</term><def><p id="Par101">Cardiovascular magnetic resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMRS</term><def><p id="Par842">Cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cr</term><def><p id="Par12">Unphosphorylated creatine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCM</term><def><p id="Par13">Dilated cardiomyopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAST</term><def><p id="Par14">Four-angle saturation transfer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCM</term><def><p id="Par15">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HF</term><def><p id="Par16">Heart failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KNN</term><def><p id="Par17">K nearest neighbor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LV</term><def><p id="Par18">Left ventricle/left ventricular</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LVH</term><def><p id="Par20">Left ventricular hypertrophy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MI</term><def><p id="Par023">Myocardial infarction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p id="Par21">Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICM</term><def><p id="Par22">Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NYHA</term><def><p id="Par23">New York Heart Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCr</term><def><p id="Par24">Phosphocreatine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROC</term><def><p id="Par25">Receiver operating curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par26">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMOTE</term><def><p id="Par27">Synthetic minority over-sampling technique</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNR</term><def><p id="Par28">Signal- to -noise ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SVM</term><def><p id="Par29">Support vector machine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T</term><def><p id="Par30">Tesla (unit)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRiST</term><def><p id="Par31">Triple repetition time saturation-transfer</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PAB conceived the study, provided the data pool and wrote the manuscript.
