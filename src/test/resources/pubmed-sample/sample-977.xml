Herein, we used flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis, and immunocytostaining analysis to demonstrate that SHED at passage 3 expressed many mesenchymal surface markers, including STRO-1, SSEA4, CD73, CD105, CD146, and CD166 but were negative for CD34 and CD45 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A-C</xref>). In comparison to BMMSCs, SHED expressed significantly higher levels of STRO-1 and CD146, and lower levels of CD105 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Additionally, SHED showed significantly high numbers of single colony clusters (colony-forming units-fibroblastic; CFU-F) and an elevated cell proliferation rate compared to BMMSCs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). This elevated proliferative capacity may be associated with the significantly increased telomerase activity in SHED (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of SHED in comparison to BMMSCs</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Flow cytometric analysis of cultured SHED at passage 3 revealed expression of STRO-1 (12.06%), CD146 (48.39%), SSEA4 (85.40%), CD73 (91.93%), CD105 (6.77%), CD166 (63.65%), but was negative for surface molecules CD34 and CD45.

SHED showed a significantly higher proliferation rate in comparison to BMMSCs (**<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). (<bold>F</bold>) SHED showed a high activity of telomerase compared to BMMSCs assessed by real time PCR. HEK293T cells (239T) were used as a positive control and heat inactivated 293T (H.I.) cells were used as a negative control.

After one week of induction, SHED were similar to BMMSCs, showing significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and the number of ALP-positive cells by flow cytometric analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and expression of elevated levels of ALP, Runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), dentin sialoprotein (DSP), and osteocalcin (OCN) by immunoblot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

However, SHED suffered remarkable impairment of adipogenic differentiation, as shown by decreased numbers of lipid-specific Oil red O-positive cells and reduced expression of adipocyte-specific molecules, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3;2 (PPAR&#x003b3;2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) when compared to BMMSCs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F-H</xref>).

SHED formed a similar amount of mineralized tissue and a reduced amount of hematopoietic marrow components when compared to BMMSC transplants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I-K</xref>). Next, we confirmed that SHED were similar to BMMSCs in activation of multiple signaling pathways, including TGF&#x003b2;, ERK, Akt, Wnt, and PDGF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L-P</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Mesenchymal stem cell properties of SHED</bold>.

(<bold>F-H</bold>) SHED showed reduced potential of differentiating into adipocytes compared to BMMSCs. Three weeks post adipogenic induction, lipid accumulation in SHED was less than that in BMMSCs by Oil-red O staining (Representative of n = 5). (<bold>F</bold>). Number of oil-red O-positive (Oil-Red-O+) cells was calculated as a percentage to total cells and averaged from five independent cultures (<bold>G</bold>) (*<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Immunoblot assay indicated that SHED expressed lower levels of adipocyte-specific molecules LPL and PPAR&#x003b3; than BMMSCs at three weeks post adipogenic culture (<bold>H</bold>). Three independent assays showed the similar results.

It appeared that SHED showed a significant inhibiting effect in reducing IL17 levels when compared to BMMSCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Our previous report indicated that activated T cells induce apoptosis of BMMSCs through the Fas/FasL pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To determine whether activated T cells also directly impinge on SHED, as occurs in BMMSCs, SHED were co-cultured with human PBMNCs activated by anti-CD3 specific antibody treatment. We found that the activated PBMNCs were able to induce part of SHED death in the co-culture system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). When SHED were separated from PBMNCs using a Transwell co-culture system or treated using anti-FasL neutralizing antibody, SHED failed to show the cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), suggesting that direct cell-cell contact and the Fas/FasL pathway are required for inducing SHED death by activated splenocytes. Next, we confirmed that SHED express Fas by immunoblot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to confirm that the SHED death was due to cell apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>SHED interplay with T-lymphocytes</bold>.

SLE is a common and potentially fatal immune disease in which autoantibodies damage multiple organs, including the kidneys, cardiovascular system, nervous system, joints, and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The pathology of SLE involves the destruction of targeted organ tissues and accumulation of auto-reactive lymphocytes and immune complexes. Although intensity and organ involvement vary significantly among SLE patients, abnormalities of T and B lymphocytes are universal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, SLE provokes multifaceted immune modulation, including both deficiency and hyperactivity of the immune system. An understanding of the underlying pathology is crucial to developing optimal therapies for the restoration of immune homeostasis without compromising the protective immune responses to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. MRL/<italic>lpr </italic>mice were generated by the insertion of the early transposable element ETn in the Fas gene, which causes a striking reduction in Fas mRNA expression and is associated clinically with marked acceleration of the lupus-like disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

The reason that SHED transplantation showed optimal therapeutic effect may be associated with the fact that SHED showed superior immunomodulatory effects compared to BMMSCs in terms of recovering Tregs/Th17 ratio and reducing Th17 cell levels in peripheral blood. In addition, SHED transplantation, as seen in BMMSC transplantation, is capable of recovering trabecular bone and inhibiting osteoclast activity, suggesting that SHED transplantation, as seen in BMMSC transplantation, could lead the reconstruction of osteoblastic niche to improve SLE disorders in SLE patients and a SLE-like murine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, SHED may be an appropriate stem cell resource for treating immune disorders via improved immunomodulatory properties. Systemic infusion of SHED fails to show a significant promoting Treg level in SLE-like mice as seen in an <italic>in vitro </italic>co-culture system, which may be associated with a complex <italic>in vivo </italic>condition that hardly compares to a simple co-culture system. However, SHED infusion resulted in a significantly up-regulated level of the ratio between Tregs and Th17 cells. This is an important index indicating immunomodulatory function of SHED due to the fact that Tregs prevent autoimmunity and Th17 cells promote autoimmunity and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The transition from deciduous teeth to adult permanent teeth is a unique and dynamic process in which the development and eruption of permanent teeth is coordinated with the resorption of deciduous teeth.
