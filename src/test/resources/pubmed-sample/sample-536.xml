Aquaporin (AQP), a water channel protein, has been suggested to play some roles for cryopreservation although its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that membrane damage caused by ultra-quick freezing is rescued by the expression of AQP4. We next examine if the expression of AQP combined with ultra-quick freezing can be used to select cells efficiently under freezing conditions where most cells are died. CHO cells stably expressing AQP4 were exclusively selected from mixed cell cultures. Having identified the increased expression of AQP4 during ES cell differentiation into neuro-ectoderm using bioinformatics, we confirmed the improved survival of differentiated ES cells with AQP4 expression. Finally we show that CHO cells transiently transfected with <italic>Endothelin receptor</italic> A and <italic>Aqp4</italic> were also selected and concentrated by multiple cycles of freezing/thawing, which was confirmed with calcium imaging in response to endothelin. Furthermore, we found that the expression of AQP enables a reduction in the amount of cryoprotectants for freezing, thereby decreasing osmotic stress and cellular toxicity. Taken together, we propose that this simple but efficient and safe method may be applicable to the selection of mammalian cells for applications in regenerative medicine as well as cell-based functional assays or drug screening protocols.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) of MEXT of Japan (22791938 and 24792152), Strategic International Research Cooperative Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Keio Gijuku Academic Development Funds and Keio University Special Grant-in-Aid for Innovative Collaborative Research Projects.

However mouse ES (mES) cells and undifferentiated human ES (hES) have poor survival rate after slow freezing, because of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0087644-Heng1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The molecular mechanisms of apoptosis are related to Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with Y-27632, which is a specific inhibitor of ROCK, improved the survival rate of ES cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in case of conventional slow freezing <xref rid="pone.0087644-Claassen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087644-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, at high cooling rates (quick freezing), extensive intracellular super-cooling and the formation of intracellular ice crystals usually occur, which causes an injury to the plasma membranes <xref rid="pone.0087644-Mazur1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. An alternative way to cryopreserve a variety of cell types, vitrification, has been previously attempted using human ES, however, potential contamination risks combined with its limited utility <xref rid="pone.0087644-Reubinoff1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087644-Fujioka1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Vitrification as well as ultra-quick freezing also requires the extremely high concentrations of cryoprotectants for Ice-free condition, which may cause cell membrane damage, probably due to toxicity of cryoprotectants as well as high osmotic shock. These problems prompted for development of simpler, more efficient, and reliable vitrification methods.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated the roles of aquaporins (AQPs), a family of water channel proteins selectively permeated by water <xref rid="pone.0087644-Agre1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, in cryopreservation of mouse oocytes <xref rid="pone.0087644-Edashige1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, microorganisms <xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and on other sections. The expression of AQP3 improved the survival rate of mouse oocytes after cryopreservation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of AQP3 increases the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to cryotherapy <xref rid="pone.0087644-Ismail1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

These observations coherently suggest that AQPs may play some roles in freeze-tolerance.</p><p>Here, we attempted to engage the cryoprotective effect of AQPs in the selection of specific mammalian cells, since only cells expressing AQPs have been shown as resistant to damage caused by freezing at high cooling rate <xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Indeed, we successfully identified a freezing tolerance of mammalian cell lines with either exogenous or endogenous AQP expression. Furthermore, combined with bioinformatics, we demonstrated the possibility of selecting specific types of cells differentiated from embryonic stem (ES) cells when the cells express AQPs in the process of each differentiation stage <xref rid="pone.0087644-Aiba1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087644-LaPorta1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which can be applied to regenerative medicine. We also showed that co-transfection of a gene of interest with AQP results in efficient accumulation of cells expressing the gene product, upon multiple cycles of freezing/thawing, suggesting that this protocol would be a potential alternative for establishment of stable cell lines to perform functional assays or drug screening protocols.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing human aquaporin-1 (AQP1) or mouse aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) cells stably expressing AQP4 were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% air in a growth medium consisting of Ham's F-12 (Wako, Japan) for CHO and D-MEM (Wako) for MDCK fortified with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) (Wako), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 0.5 mg/mL G418 antibiotics (Nacalai tesque) in 10-cm culture dishes.

During freezing/thawing, cells are exposed to a variety of stresses, such as changes in temperature, changes in water content, ice crystal formation, and changes in solute concentration <xref rid="pone.0087644-Mazur1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. At low cooling rates, ice crystal formation remains extracellular whereas, at high cooling rates, extensive intracellular super-cooling and the formation of intracellular ice crystals occur, causing cellular injury to the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0087644-Steponkus1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Consistently, CHO cells survive after freezing at low cooling rates but died at high cooling rates or ultra-quick freezing. Thus, the finding that the expression of AQP rescues cells from membrane damage and significantly improves cell survival rate after ultra-quick freezing is remarkable. The freezing tolerance of cells depends on membrane water permeability and the dynamics of water molecules inside and outside of cells. AQP-mediated facilitated diffusion of water molecules is temperature independent <xref rid="pone.0087644-Ibata1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, whereas the simple diffusion of water though a lipid bilayer depends on temperature, implying that the difference in water permeability becomes more obvious at lower temperatures; the water permeability of a cell membrane without AQP quickly becomes limited, whereas that of a membrane containing AQP remains relatively high. We therefore suspect that AQP can contribute to the improvement in cryopreservation by increasing membrane water permeability even under low temperatures <xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087644-Ibata1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Since this unique feature of AQP can be seen not only for exogenous AQP expression but also for endogenous AQP expression, diverse applications of this selection system, from basic science to clinical medicine including regenerative and reproductive medicine, are feasible <xref rid="pone.0087644-Tanghe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087644-Katkov1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>The clinical application of iPS cells or ES cells is currently one of the most urgent issues in biology and medicine <xref rid="pone.0087644-Stadtfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

All cells transfected with an expression construct containing AQP4 are initially resistant to ultra-quick freezing and can survive after the first thawing. However, most of the plasmids incorporated into the cells independently localize in the nucleus, and will not be amplified because in most cases, a plasmid has no origin for replication in the mammalian cells, thereby the cells are gradually lost the expression of the plasmids as the cells proliferate. Loss of the plasmids makes cells negative for a gene of interest as well as AQP and sensitive to ultra-quick freezing/thawing. Thus, cells lacking the plasmid will be removed in the process of multiple freezing/thawing. On the other hand, once the construct is integrated into the genomic DNA of host cells, it can be replicate in synchronization with replication of the genomic DNA, resulting in accumulation of cell expressing a gene of interest. Our protocol can achieve concentration of cells with relatively higher expression level of a gene of interest in a shorter period than conventional methods probably because a threshold of expression level of AQP4 required for cell survival is high as compared with that of drug-resistant genes such as the neomycin-resistant gene. There is some concern that exogenous expression of AQP might affect the functions of genes that are co-transfected as targets of investigation, but significant effects are unlikely, based on the integrity of ET<sub>A</sub>R function observed in the present study, although the possibility of interference should always be carefully evaluated.</p><p>Finally, We would like to point out that this method works even under conditions that reduce the concentration of cryoprotectants and the osmotic stress.
