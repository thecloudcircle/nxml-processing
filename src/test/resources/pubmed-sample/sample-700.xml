Here, we established an autoimmune model of melanotic mass formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by genetically disrupting the basement membrane. We found that the basement membrane endows otherwise susceptible target tissues with self-tolerance that prevents autoimmunity, and further demonstrated that laminin is a key component for both structural maintenance and the self-tolerance checkpoint function of the basement membrane. Moreover, we found that cell integrity, as determined by cell-cell interaction and apicobasal polarity, functions as a second discrete checkpoint. Target tissues became vulnerable to blood cell encapsulation and subsequent melanization only after loss of both the basement membrane and cell integrity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Autoimmune diseases may be caused by failures in the immune system or by altered selfness in target tissues; however, which of these is more critical is controversial. To better understand such diseases, it is necessary to first define the molecular mechanisms that provide self-tolerance to healthy tissues. As a model system, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> melanotic mass formation, in which blood cells encapsulate degenerating self-tissues. By manipulating basement-membrane components specifically in target tissues, not in blood cells, we could elicit autoimmune responses against the altered self-tissues. Moreover, we found that at least two different checkpoints for self-tolerance operate discretely in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. This parallels mammalian immunity and provides etiological insight into certain autoimmune diseases in which structural abnormalities precede immune system pathology, such as Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome and type I diabetes mellitus.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a grant of the Korea Healthcare Technology R&#x00026;D Project, Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI12C1638).

In fact, the same receptors that were originally found to bind specific types of pathogens are often involved in autoimmune diseases, making this issue more puzzling <xref rid="pgen.1004683-MarshakRothstein1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. To understand this process, it is imperative to molecularly define the notion of the &#x0201c;immunological self&#x0201d;.</p><p>Autoimmune-like responses are also observed in invertebrates. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, degenerating internal tissues are subjected to hemocyte (insect blood cell) encapsulation, in which large, flat lamellocytes wrap up the target tissues in layers and melanize them via the phenoloxidase cascade. This process is called melanotic mass formation <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004683-Minakhina1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The same process occurs as part of the immunological defense against oversized pathogenic invaders, such as parasitoid wasp eggs, which are too large to be engulfed by the most abundant phagocytic hemocytes, the plasmatocytes <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Meister1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Currently, about 100 genes have been found to display melanotic masses upon mutation or overexpression (see FlyBase.org). These genes are seemingly unrelated, and the specific triggers of this autoimmune-like reaction are largely obscure.</p><p>More than 30 years ago, Rizki and Rizki reported that the basement membrane (BM) appeared to serve as a barrier against hemocyte attack of self-tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Whereas a same-species implant with the intact BM remained in the host, implants that had been mechanically damaged or pre-treated with collagenase to disrupt the BM triggered lamellocyte encapsulation <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Moreover, undamaged implants from sibling species did not induce lamellocyte encapsulation, whereas undamaged implants from distantly related species did, suggesting that hemocytes may recognize the molecular architecture of the BM of its own species. This interesting study raises several important questions as to which molecular component of the BM is crucial for blocking melanotic mass formation of self-tissues, and whether the BM is the sole surface feature for self-tolerance. Furthermore, their experiments were carried out in a sensitized genetic background, <italic>tu(1)Sz<sup>ts</sup></italic>, in which the hemocytes were marginally hyperactive at a permissive temperature, which made it unclear whether the mass formation is caused primarily by defects in immune cells or target tissues. These questions have never been probed with genetic tools, largely due to the essential nature of the genes encoding the BM components collagen IV and laminin <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004683-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. More recently, BM disruption was shown to act as a signal to recruit hemocytes to wound regions or to metastasizing tumors, providing further evidence for the BM-hemocyte relationship <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Babcock1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004683-Paddibhatla1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The BM is located on the basal side of epithelial tissues and serves multiple functions as a cell-supporting matrix, a tissue barrier, and ligands for cell surface receptors <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Sasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Yurchenco1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The composition of the BM varies between tissue types, but in general, the BM contains the following four major components: collagen IV and laminin, which together form a meshwork, and the proteoglycan Perlecan and Nidogen, which function in the scaffold. The BM is maintained by evolutionarily conserved cell surface receptors, such as integrin and dystroglycan <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Colognato1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has two collagen IV genes, <italic>Cg25C</italic> (for &#x003b1;1 chain) and <italic>vkg</italic> (&#x003b1;2), and four laminin genes, <italic>wb</italic> (for laminin &#x003b1;1,2), <italic>LanA</italic> (&#x003b1;3,5), <italic>LanB1</italic> (&#x003b2;), and <italic>LanB2</italic> (&#x003b3;) <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Natzle1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004683-Montell1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Collagen IV is thought to exist mostly as Cg25C/Vkg heterotrimers, and LanB1 and LanB2 form the common core of the two laminin trimers, laminin W and laminin A. Thus, the mutant phenotypes of these genes are very similar in their own categories, and absence of one subunit is known to prevent BM incorporation of the other(s) <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Urbano1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Wolfstetter1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-PastorPareja2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Melanotic masses formed mainly in fat bodies and salivary glands. We analyzed the fat bodies of these larvae by immunostaining with the lamellocyte-specific L1 antibody.

Knockdown using any of the available <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> transgenes singly did not induce melanotic masses, presumably due low knockdown efficiencies with <italic>FB-GAL4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g002">Figure 2C</xref>); however, knockdown of various combinations of the transgenes induced melanotic masses specifically in the fat body in the absence of a sensitized genetic background <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We obtained similar results following fat body-specific RNAi knockdown for integrins or Dystroglycan, which should act strictly in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

In fat bodies, collagen IV knockdown with <italic>Hsp70-GAL4</italic> reduced not only collagen IV (the fluorescence intensity was 5.23% of the control level) but also laminin in the BM (hereafter, BM laminin) effectively (33.46%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g001">Figure 1H and 1K</xref>). Similarly, laminin knockdown (11.56%) nearly completely eliminated the BM collagen IV (0.91%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g001">Figure 1I and 1K</xref>), indicating that these factors are structurally inter-dependent in this organ. In salivary glands, however, collagen IV knockdown with the same <italic>Hsp70-GAL4</italic> eliminated only collagen IV (0.47%), while leaving 75.61% of laminin in the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g003">Figure 3B and 3D</xref>), allowing for separation of the two components in this organ. Laminin knockdown (6.71%) effectively removed the BM collagen IV (18.02%) in the salivary gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>), as in the fat bodies.

As a self-tolerance checkpoint, the BM may either serve as a physical barrier or provide an inhibitory ligand for hemocyte receptors. We speculate that the latter is the case for several reasons. First, the heterospecific implantation experiments described above suggest that the hemocyte recognizes the BM structure of its own species <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Second, insect hemocytes are known to encapsulate a wide range of foreign materials, from parasitoid wasp eggs to synthetic beads, when injected into the hemocoel <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki5" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Warburg1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Salt1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Encapsulation of parasites is faster than encapsulation of non-parasitic, heterospecific implants <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki4" ref-type="bibr">[discussed in 11]</xref>. Thus, hemocytes must be equipped with various cell surface receptors, including some as activating receptors with different binding spectra for pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and others as inhibitory receptors with narrow binding specificities to self-tissues.

With either one of the checkpoints, self-tissue may become tolerant to the immune system of its own. Upon Mmp<italic>2</italic> overexpression (OE), the salivary gland loses BM integrity to an extent that allows plasmatocyte access; however, cell integrity remains largely intact (intact 2<sup>nd</sup> checkpoint). Upon integrin knockdown (KD) in the salivary gland (<italic>AB1&#x0003e;mys-i</italic>), cells lose cell integrity, while the organ maintains the BM (intact 1<sup>st</sup> checkpoint). In the presence of laminin knockdown, both of the self-tolerance checkpoints are non-functional, and the tissues are subjected to lamellocyte encapsulation. Avirulent parasitoid eggs or wing disc implants from distantly related species <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rizki4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> do not have either of the checkpoints that are compatible with the host immune system, and thus, these foreign bodies are also sequestered by lamellocyte encapsulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1004683.g006"/></fig><p>Furthermore, we have identified cell integrity as another checkpoint for self-tolerance. Self-tissues must lose both the BM and cell integrity in order to be subjected to lamellocyte encapsulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The two checkpoints are indeed discrete and experimentally separable. In our experimental system, BM integrity or cell integrity could be disrupted in the salivary gland selectively via <italic>ptc&#x0003e;Mmp2</italic> or <italic>AB1&#x0003e;mys-i</italic>, respectively. The salivary glands of these larvae are subjected to melanotic encapsulation if the tissues fail to acquire the state of self-tolerance from the other, remaining checkpoint. Therefore, multiple failures on sequential self-tolerance checkpoints elicit autoimmune responses, which is analogous to the mechanism of self-tolerance in the mammalian adaptive immune system <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Goodnow1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In this respect, BM laminin is unique in that knockdown of laminin disrupted both BM integrity and cell integrity simultaneously. During pharyngeal tube formation of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, laminin is required for establishment of cell polarity of a group of precursor cells called the double plate <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rasmussen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Since this process occurs before the tissue BM is formed and the mutant phenotype is not shared by collagen IV or perlecan mutants, the authors concluded that this function of laminin is distinguished from its role in the BM. Our results indicate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> laminin functions similarly and thus is unique among the BM components.</p><p>Since cell integrity was identified as a discrete self-tolerance checkpoint, it is interesting that target tissue is not subjected to encapsulation during wound healing or developmental processes in which BM integrity is disrupted temporarily. Upon tissue damage, circulating plasmatocytes attach to the wound region as early as 5 min <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Babcock1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, presumably to help remodel the tissue, including the disrupted BM, as hemocytes also produce BM components <xref rid="pgen.1004683-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004683-KuscheGullberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). According to our model, as long as cell integrity remains intact, this checkpoint would warrant self-tolerance and block lamellocyte encapsulation in these cases, and thus, wound repair would proceed safely (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004683-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).
