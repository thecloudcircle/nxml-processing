Although at least 102 countries have school health services, there is no rigorous, evidence-based guidance on which school health services are effective and should be implemented in schools. To investigate the effectiveness of school health services for improving the health of school-age children and adolescents, a systematic review of systematic reviews (overview) was conducted. Five databases were searched through June 2018. Systematic reviews of intervention studies that evaluated school-based or school-linked health services delivered by a health provider were included. Review quality was assessed using a modified Ballard and Montgomery four-item checklist. 1654 references were screened and 20 systematic reviews containing 270 primary studies were assessed narratively. Interventions with evidence for effectiveness addressed autism, depression, anxiety, obesity, dental caries, visual acuity, asthma, and sleep. No review evaluated the effectiveness of a multi-component school health services intervention addressing multiple health areas. From the limited amount of information available in existing systematic reviews, the strongest evidence supports implementation of anxiety prevention programs, indicated asthma education, and vision screening with provision of free spectacles. Additional systematic reviews are needed that analyze the effectiveness of comprehensive school health services, and specific services for under-researched health areas relevant for this population.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global School Health Initiative in 1995 with the goal to improve child, adolescent and community health through health promotion and programming in schools [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This initiative is dedicated to promoting development of school health programs and increasing the number of health-promoting schools, characterized by WHO as &#x0201c;a school constantly strengthening its capacity as a healthy setting for living, learning and working&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2000, WHO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank developed a partnership for Focusing Resources on Effective School Health&#x02013;a FRESH Start approach [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The FRESH framework promotes four pillars: health-related school policies, provision of safe water and sanitation, skills-based health education and school-based health and nutrition services [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While various guidance documents have been published by United Nations (UN) organizations addressing a range of services from oral health to malaria [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], there is no internationally accepted guideline regarding school health services. This systematic review of systematic reviews, henceforth referred to as an overview, will inform the upcoming development of a WHO guideline that addresses the school health services component of health-promoting schools and feeds into the FRESH framework. This overview and the upcoming WHO guideline will specifically address school health services delivered by health providers.</p><p>Schools offer a unique platform for health care delivery. In 2015, the global means for the primary and secondary net school enrollment rates were 90% and 65%, respectively, thus the potential reach of school health services is wide [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, a recent review found that school-based or school-linked health services already exist in at least 102 countries [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The 2017 Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) implementation guidance calls for the prioritization of school health programs as an important step towards universal health coverage and urges that &#x0201c;Every school should be a health promoting school&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this overview was to explore the effectiveness of school-based or school-linked health services delivered by a health provider for improving the health of school-age children and adolescents. Through a comprehensive literature search, the overview aimed to identify health areas and specific school health service interventions that have at least some evidence of effectiveness. It was also designed to suggest further research in areas where recent systematic reviews (SRs) exist, but with insufficient evidence. Finally, the overview aimed to identify the health areas and specific school health services interventions for which no SRs were found, whether because the primary literature does not exist or where there are primary studies but no SR has been conducted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This overview was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

There were no date restrictions on publication of included SRs. In addition to these criteria for included studies, the SRs themselves had to fulfill the following criteria: (a) included the words &#x0201c;systematic review&#x0201d; in the title or abstract; (b) outlined inclusion criteria within the methods section; (c) published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed before June 15, 2018; (d) published in the English language.

High overlap can contribute to biased results [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This overview used the corrected covered area (CCA), a comprehensive and validated measure, to determine overlap [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The CCA is calculated using three variables: the number of &#x0201c;index&#x0201d; publications (r), the number of total publications (N), and the number of SRs within the overview (c). An &#x0201c;index&#x0201d; publication is the first appearance of a primary study within an overview. The formula for the CCA is:

Following the recommendation of the AMSTAR 2 developers [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], individual ratings were not combined into an overall score. Instead, the authors determined which of the 16 items on the checklist were critical for this overview and which of the items were non-critical. Building on a method suggested by Shea and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], grades of confidence in the results of each SR were generated based on critical flaws and non-critical weaknesses. The grading system is available in Tables E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212603.s006">S6 Appendix</xref>. Confidence in results ranged from high (three or fewer non-critical weaknesses) to critically low (more than three critical flaws with or without non-critical weaknesses) [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The final two items in the four-item checklist are (3) date of publication to ensure that results are up-to-date, and (4) matching of the scope to confirm that primary studies within SRs are relevant to the overview. This overview considered SRs published in 2016, 2017, or 2018 to be up-to-date. Although all SRs were included if at least 50% of the primary studies within them fulfilled all inclusion criteria, SRs where closer to 100% of primary studies fulfilled all criteria were considered to be better matched than those with closer to 50%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Results of the search</title><p>1720 references were identified from the systematic literature search. 570 were duplicates, leaving 1150 titles and abstracts to be screened.

The other SR examined behavioral interventions in the form of education on tooth brushing and the use of fluoride toothpaste in Brazil, Italy, United Kingdom, and Iran [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

The majority of SRs assessed educational, counseling, or preventive interventions, most of which were special research interventions rather than routinely-delivered school health services. No SR examined comprehensive or multi-component school health services, despite the fact that comprehensive services may be more efficient, easier to implement, and more sustainable than single interventions [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is unclear if this finding indicates a lack of primary studies on comprehensive or multi-component school health services, or if primary studies do exist but no SR has been conducted. Results from this overview suggest that certain interventions can be effective in improving child and adolescent health outcomes, and thus may be worthwhile for integration into school health programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Effectiveness of specific interventions</title><p>Vision screening is one of the most common forms of school health services [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although the majority of programs are concentrated in high-income countries (HIC) [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although prevalence of visual impairment varies widely by ethnic group and age [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], WHO estimates that at least 19 million children below age 15 are visually impaired [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Evans and colleagues found strong evidence from China, Tanzania, and India that school vision screening for correctable visual acuity deficits increased wearing of spectacles when spectacles were provided at no cost [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A recent guideline from the International Agency for Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) reiterates the importance of free spectacles and goes further to suggest that low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) adopt comprehensive school eye health programs [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Vision screening linked with free provision of spectacles, as a component of a comprehensive school eye health program, is an example of a cost-effective form of school health services that may be implemented.</p><p>Five SRs covered depression and/or anxiety prevention and early intervention programs, with the FRIENDS for Life program (FRIENDS) and the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP) most common [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Given that FRIENDS has been endorsed by WHO [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and was found to be effective in decreasing anxiety symptoms in all four SRs where it was mentioned in this overview [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], policy makers and school health officials may consider incorporating this or similar programs into existing school health services. However, it should be noted that these SRs found mixed evidence of maintenance of effects over time [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The four SRs that included PRP found mixed evidence [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or no evidence of effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], bringing the popularity of this intervention into question. Finally, creative therapy interventions seem to be effective for indicated populations of school-age children, such as children with autism spectrum disorder [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, this conclusion should be interpreted cautiously due to small effect sizes, small sample sizes, and conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of music therapy between Sullivan and Simonson [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Gold and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Comprehensive school programs that promote healthy school environments, health and nutrition literacy, and physical activity are one of the six key areas for ending childhood obesity recommended by WHO [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This overview found only one SR that assessed obesity treatment and prevention delivered by a health professional in schools, despite the fact that over 340 million school-age children and adolescents were overweight or obese in 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Schroeder and colleagues found that school nurses are well positioned to deliver nutritional counseling, design and coordinate physical activity interventions, and educate parents, students, and staff on health, nutrition, and fitness [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, all included primary studies were delivered in HIC [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Schools are considered to be an ideal platform for oral health promotion through education, services, and the school environment [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The most promising evidence from a SR was on topical application of fluoride gel for the prevention of dental caries [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], although the necessity of this intervention may be questioned where flouridated commerical toothpaste is readily available. Educational interventions had mixed effects. A SR that focused on behavioral education, such as demonstrating how to correctly brush teeth, found no evidence for reduction in caries [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], whereas a SR on oral hygiene and caries education found evidence for decreased plaque and improved hygiene [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. More research should be done to identify the content and methods of deliver that make some oral health education interventions more effective than others.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Overall effectiveness of school health services</title><p>It is difficult to determine overall effectiveness of school health services from this overview because the included SRs do not sufficiently cover the health areas most relevant for children and adolescents. In 2015, the top five leading causes of death for 5&#x02013;9 year olds were lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, meningitis, drowning, and road injury [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Among 10&#x02013;14 year olds, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory infections, drowning, road injury, diarrheal diseases, and meningitis [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Finally, for 15&#x02013;19 year olds, the leading causes of death were road injury, self-harm, interpersonal violence, diarrheal diseases, and lower respiratory infections [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 10&#x02013;19 year olds were iron deficiency anemia, road injury, depressive disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrheal diseases [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This overview shows that the current SR literature does address mental health, specifically mood disorders. However, the leading causes of death and disability beyond self-harm and depressive disorders are currently not addressed. Although mortality and morbidity statistics vary by region and country, it is clear that the health areas included in this overview reflect a small subset of the global burden of disease for children and adolescents.</p><p>Furthermore, this overview exposes a mismatch between the SR literature on effectiveness of school health services and the actual school health services that are most commonly delivered. Vaccinations have been identified as the most common type of intervention in schools in at least 35 countries or territories [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and there is evidence of effectiveness from primary studies regarding feasibility of school-based vaccination programs [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Yet no SRs on vaccinations fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this overview, suggesting the need for these SRs to be conducted, focusing on whether vaccinations for this age group should be delivered as part of a school health service or not, rather than on whether the vaccination <italic>per se</italic> is effective. Additionally, at least 94 countries or territories include some form of school health services that are routinely delivered, as opposed to special research interventions [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This overview primarily found evidence for special research interventions, suggesting a need for assessment of routinely-delivered school health services. One of the central questions of this overview was whether the school health services that are regularly delivered across the globe are evidence-based. The mismatch in the SR literature identified by this overview demonstrates that more research must be done before an answer to this question can be determined.</p><p>Another important gap that this overview reveals is a lack of research on interventions carried out in LMIC and low-income countries (LIC). Only one of the 20 SRs included in this overview examined studies from a majority of LMIC and LIC [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This is problematic given that health disparities for children and adolescents are greater in LMIC and LIC than in higher income countries [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, resources differ by income level and therefore effective interventions in HIC may need to be tailored or changed entirely in order to be feasible in LMIC and LIC. WHO reports densities of less than one physician per 1000 population in 76 countries and less than three nurses or midwives per 1000 population in 87 countries [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, responsibility for interventions may need to be redistributed in countries with limited access to health professionals. This may be solved by coordinating school visits from hospital-based health professionals or by linking schools with local health centers for children and adolescents to access as needed. Given the wide reach of schools [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the fact that school health services already exist in at least 102 countries [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], research on the effectiveness of school health services in LMIC and LIC must be prioritized in order to fulfill Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 and reach universal health coverage by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Although three SRs mentioned the cost of specialized professionals delivering interventions versus teachers or a school nurse [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], cost, let alone cost-effectiveness, was not closely analyzed in any of the included SRs. For useful recommendations to be made regarding school health services, cost-effectiveness must be more closely examined by primary studies and SRs.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Methodological limitations of overviews of systematic reviews</title><p>Although overviews offer a comprehensive method for synthesizing evidence, they also come with important methodological limitations. First, an overview is unlikely to include the latest evidence if recent primary studies have not yet been included in SRs. This lag may preclude the ability for an overview to truly reflect current knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While this overview found significant gaps in the evidence for certain health areas, this does not necessarily mean that relevant high quality primary trials have not been conducted.</p><p>Second, the ability of overviews to make valid and accurate conclusions is dependent upon the accuracy, rigor, and inclusiveness of the SRs themselves. 80% (n = 16) of SRs included in this overview were given ratings of low or critically low confidence using the AMSTAR 2 checklist, although this is not unusual given the stringency of the checklist. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that all four of the SRs given moderate or high levels of confidence were Cochrane reviews. The remaining Cochrane review was given a critically low level of confidence, though this may be because it was published in 2006 and standards for both the methods and reporting of Cochrane reviews have improved in recent years.</p><p>Third, the scopes of individual SRs often differ from the scope of the overview, a problem that Ballard and Montgomery call a &#x0201c;scope mismatch&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this overview, SRs with at least 50% of included studies fulfilling all criteria were included after extensive discussion between the authors and experts in the field. This implies that a narrower range of SRs would have been eligible if a stricter cut-off had been selected, and vice versa. It is important to take this into account when interpreting results.</p><p>Finally, overlap of primary trials between SRs can bias results of an overview [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There is no definitive guidance on how to correct for overlap, as both including or excluding overlapping SRs presents potentially biased results [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This overview measured overlap using the corrected covered area (CCA) [<xref rid="pone.0212603.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and did not exclude overlapping studies. However, the degree of overlap across all 20 SRs was graded as being small (CCA = 1), while there was high overlap in SRs on mood disorders (CCA = 11). CCA values for all health areas and calculations are available in Tables C and D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212603.s005">S5 Appendix</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Additional strengths and limitations of this overview</title><p>A key limitation of this overview is that only publications self-titled &#x0201c;systematic reviews&#x0201d; were included. This decision was made because of the vast numbers of reviews available and the increased rigor associated with the term &#x0201c;systematic&#x0201d;. In a sensitivity analysis that we conducted comparing &#x0201c;systematic*&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;systematic review&#x0201d; we found that the number of search results increased almost three-fold, but did not reveal any new articles that would eventually have met the subsequent eligibility criteria (search results available on request).</p><p>Another limitation is that this overview only included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies and other controlled study designs where health professionals delivered the intervention. These criteria likely exclude potentially relevant literature. For example, the exclusion of observational studies limits the ability of this overview to assess interventions where controlled studies may be unethical or impractical, such as for an intervention that has been clearly shown to be effective when delivered in a different context and the school health service program wishes to include it. Further, the exclusion of interventions delivered by non-health providers reduces the quantity and breadth of SRs included in this overview. It is likely that some interventions may have the same or perhaps an even better level of effectiveness when delivered by non-health providers, such as a teacher, as compared to when delivered by health providers. Nonetheless, these criteria were necessary to give the overview a reasonable scope. Further, they strengthen the rigor of included studies and improve decision-making ability.</p><p>A strength of this overview is that it attempted to answer a question that has not yet been answered regarding the effectiveness of both comprehensive and specific school health services delivered by a health provider. While other pillars of Health Promoting Schools have relevant guidance documents, guidance on school health services is limited and not explicitly evidence-based. Given the wide reach of schools and the fact that school health services already exist in most countries, international guidelines are needed to clarify whether school health services can be effective, and if so, which interventions should and should not be included. This overview makes an important first step toward that guideline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This overview presents multiple effective interventions that may be offered as a part of school health services delivered by a health provider. However, it is difficult to formulate an overarching answer about the effectiveness of school health services for improving the health of school-age children and adolescents due to the heterogeneity of SRs found and the evident gaps in the SR literature. More than half of included SRs analyzed mental health and oral health interventions, and no SRs were found that assessed other relevant health areas, such as vaccinations, communicable diseases, injuries, etc. Further, no SRs evaluated comprehensive or multi-component school health services. If school health services are to truly improve the health of children and adolescents, they must comprehensively address the most pressing problems of this population. In order for policy makers and leaders in school health to make evidence-based recommendations on which services should be available in schools, who should deliver them, and how should they be delivered, more SRs must be done. These SRs must assess routine, multi-component school health services and the characteristics that make them effective, with special attention to content, quality, intensity, method of delivery, and cost. The gaps in the SR literature identified by this overview will inform the commissioning of new SRs by WHO to feed into evidence-based global recommendations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212603.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212603.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212603.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Search strategy.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212603.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212603.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Excluded full text articles.</title><p><bold>Table A</bold>.
