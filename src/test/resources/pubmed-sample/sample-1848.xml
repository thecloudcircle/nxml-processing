With limited time, they also experience emotional changes that relate to their uncertain future. Transitions experienced in such situations are often studied by focusing on individual aspects, which are synthesized in the following study. The aim was to conduct a qualitative meta-synthesis to explore the experiences patients and their families gain during transitions in palliative care circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted following an inductive approach as proposed by Sandelowski and Barroso. Inclusion criteria were studies with adult persons in palliative situations and articles published in English or German. Relevant articles were identified by researching the Pubmed and Cinahl databases, as well as by hand searches in journals and reference lists for the period 2000&#x02013;2015. The findings of each study were analyzed using initial coding, followed by axial and selective coding in this order. Consequently, a conceptual model was derived from the categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In total 2225 articles were identified in the literature search. Finally, 14 studies were included after the selection process. The central phenomenon observed among palliative care patients and their families was maintaining normality during transitions. Transitions are initially experienced unconsciously until a crisis occurs and responsive actions are necessary, which encourages patients and families to perceive the situation consciously and develop strategies for its negotiation. Patients remain caught between hopelessness and valuing their remaining time alive. As the illness progresses, informal caregivers reprioritize and balance their roles, and after death, family members inevitably find themselves in changed roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">In palliative care situations, transitions are experienced differently by patients and their families in a constant phenomenon that oscillates between unconscious and conscious perceptions of transitions. The derived conceptual model offers an additional perspective to existing models and helps to clarify the phenomenon in practical settings. The study promotes a differentiated conceptual view of transitions and emphasizes patients&#x02019; and families&#x02019; perspectives.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Transitions</kwd><kwd>End of life</kwd><kwd>Palliative care</kwd><kwd>Informal caregiver</kwd><kwd>Family</kwd><kwd>Normality</kwd><kwd>Future</kwd><kwd>Hope</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Transitions are a phenomenon of change affecting individuals and groups. In Transitions Theory, people are described as more vulnerable to health risks while experiencing transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In palliative care, transitions are characterized by individuals experiencing a change due to deterioration or improvements of their health status. This can be changes of <italic>place</italic> (e.g. hospital to home, home to hospice), in <italic>level of care</italic> (e.g. informal care to professional health care, professional health care to professional <italic>palliative</italic> health care) or in <italic>goals of care</italic> (e.g. curative to palliative and no further treatment). Some transitions combine a change of place and level of care, e.g. persons with palliative care needs experience increasing care as their illness progresses and, when finally their needs cannot be fulfilled in the home, they are transferred to an inpatient hospice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Individuals may experience multiple transitions during their illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Especially for individuals in a palliative context, the situation is characterized by various and continuous transitions that occur individually. For persons with palliative care needs, experiences of transitions are accompanied by distress and feelings of disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], as transitions often occur suddenly and confront persons with palliative care needs and their families with new life situations. Family members and informal caregivers adopt new roles, accept responsibility and deal with own feelings while giving support to persons with palliative care needs during transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Research on this topic focuses on a) experiences of transitions in different patient groups, b) specific transitions like from curative to palliative, c) transitions in the health care system from one setting to another, or d) are related to transitions within a specific setting such as homecare or hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A qualitative synthesis of existing findings to acquire an in-depth view on transitions experienced by persons with palliative care needs and their families, irrespective of their place of care or who cares for them, is lacking.</p><p id="Par7">This paper intends to synthesize qualitative research about how transitions in palliative care circumstances are experienced by persons with palliative care needs due to cancerous diseases and their families. The European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] defines palliative care as an interdisciplinary approach for patients and their families to preserve quality of life. Care is provided through control of pain and other symptoms, as well as through support in social, psychological and spiritual problems. Relevant literature describes a controversial understanding of who is palliative and the conditions requiring palliative care (life-threatening, life-limiting, progressive (fatal) illness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The EAPC definition describing palliative care for patients &#x0201c;whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is perceived as vague [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the meta-synthesis defines persons receiving palliative care as those that are inducted into palliative treatment because of cancerous diseases and whose diseases will be fatal in the foreseeable future. The term <italic>family</italic> encompasses closely related persons and informal caregivers, regardless of a family relationship, and refers to those whom the patient includes in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The following research question guided this study: How do persons in palliative care circumstances and their families experience transitions from receiving a palliative status until death?</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par8">A mixed-methods studies review was originally planned to answer the research question. Therefore, the inclusion criteria were studies with adult persons in palliative situations published in English or German between 2000 and 2015. To include data for the focus of interest, no restrictions relating to study design or scientific merit were imposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Searching for and appraising the research reports</title><p id="Par9">The literature search was performed between 06.10.2014&#x02013;30.01.2015 (update 05.06.2015.) on the Pubmed and CINAHL databases. The search terms were: (Palliative care OR terminal care OR hospice care OR end of life) AND (patient OR informal caregiver OR next of kin OR family) AND (transition OR coping). Search terms were adjusted slightly to fit the different search systems, such as the use of MeSH terms in Pubmed. Additionally, hand searches in six palliative care journals (BMC Palliative Care, BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care, Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing, Journal of Palliative Care, Journal of Palliative Medicine, Palliative Medicine) and in reference lists of included studies were conducted. The literature search was set up broadly so that relevant studies could not be overlooked.</p><p id="Par10">Two researchers independently screened the identified records for eligibility and discussed discrepancies. 31 studies suited the research topic. In a next step, two researchers read the studies meeting the inclusion criteria and appraised them separately using the checklists for qualitative research and cohort studies of the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to systematically identify strengths and weaknesses of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Results of the critical appraisal were compared and discrepancies discussed. Remaining discrepancies were discussed and clarified with the third researcher. The critical appraisal showed that the quality of studies identified was insufficient, especially the quantitative ones. Therefore, the available qualitative studies that received a good appraisal were used for a qualitative meta-synthesis. Qualitative studies with slightly lower quality were used if their content held relevant information. A meta-synthesis is a method to obtain an interpretive integration of qualitative results offering a fully integrated description of the research issue instead of a summary of unlinked features. The meta-synthesis followed the recommended steps of Sandelowski and Barroso&#x02019;s (2007): formulating a purpose (1), searching for and retrieving qualitative research reports (2), appraising the research reports (3), classifying the findings (4), conducting a meta-summary (5) and developing a meta-synthesis (6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Classifying the findings, conducting a meta-summary and developing a meta-synthesis</title><p id="Par11">In a qualitative meta-synthesis, findings of studies should be read in regard to what they reveal about the specific measures that were applied. Therefore, it is important to be aware of how the findings were interpreted. Studies included in the meta-synthesis as recommended were classified with a typology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The included studies were located in one of the following classifications: thematic surveys, conceptual/ thematic descriptions, or interpretive explanations.</p><p id="Par12">The basic assumption for conducting a meta-summary and developing a meta-synthesis was that the findings of the included studies are the researchers&#x02019; interpretations of their collected data. Consequently, the written findings of the included studies were treated like a transcript in a qualitative study. Therefore, the results section of each study was used as data for the meta-synthesis. Analysis started by re-reading the studies several times in a process of familiarization. Initial coding as an inductive analysis procedure was used as the first cycle method, followed by axial and selective coding as second and third cycle method in this order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The aim was to reflect deeply on the contents of the data and to gain higher levels of abstraction and conceptualization with ongoing coding. This method of constant comparison enabled the identification of similarities and differences. As coding is an iterative and cycling process, codes were re-examined by three researchers several times. Core components of the inductive meta-summary were initial and axial coding showing a quantitatively oriented aggregation of the findings. The codes and categories were then synthesized through further analysis in axial and selective coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Finally, a conceptual model was derived on the main categories. The qualitative data analysis software MAXqda12 supported data analysis process.</p><p id="Par13">Furthermore, results were counterchecked with the article by Penrod et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which is a grounded theory of family caregivers&#x02019; experiences in end-of-life caregiving. Penrod et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] derived from their analysis a model of caregiving through the end of life. The model comprises experiences and key transitions of informal caregivers from prediagnosis through the end of life. The main process describes informal caregivers &#x0201c;seeking normal&#x0201d;. Since Penrod&#x02019;s article contains a comprehensive grounded middle-range theory with strong emphasis on illness trajectories, the results were not included to ensure the inductive analysis process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Results</title><p id="Par14">In total, the literature search yielded 2219 records from databases and 6 from the hand search. The records were imported into a reference management system. 2145 records remained after deletion of the duplicates. Two researchers independently screened the title and abstract for eligibility and discussed discrepancies. In a next step, two researchers read the identified 31 full-texts and used the Critical Appraisal Skills Program. A qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted instead of a mixed studies review, due to the poor quality of the identified quantitative studies. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-synthesis after discussion of eligibility and critical appraisal within the research team.

They adapt their life situations to these transitions. Generally, adaptation can be divided into unconscious (passive) and conscious (active) forms. Unconscious adaptations occur constantly and are characterized by passive responses on the part of the individual and by letting things happen. Syr&#x000e9;n et al. state that this behavior is combined with insecurity, withdrawal and a sense of helplessness. Helplessness is compounded by a lack of resources inside and outside the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As an example, increasing dependency on care in the palliative situation is perceived initially as an unconscious process until finally the situation cannot be dealt with anymore. This marks the transition that also can be seen as a crisis of understanding the crisis as a situation in which changes in behavior, reorientations and decisions become necessary. The transition is noticed consciously and persons with palliative care needs, as well as their families, actively elaborate new strategies that enable the maintenance of normality. For Syr&#x000e9;n et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], an active behavior comes about through openness and comfort, e.g. sharing thoughts with each other, togetherness and the will of family members to prevent concerned persons from suffering. The availability of resources inside and outside the family helps to remain in control of the situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Inner strength is gained and defined through hope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] that is seen as &#x0201c;a companion, a fellow traveler &#x0201c;and can be influenced from the outside, e.g. the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, families can increase the quality of life of persons with palliative care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Reciprocity is an important resource, as the network of friends and community provide emotional and practical support that helps to manage transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Persons with palliative care needs and their families adapt by maintaining normality. Daily routines are preserved until another phenomenon occurs (e.g. new or worsened symptoms) and again, unconscious and later conscious adaptations are made. Therefore, concerned persons and their families vacillate between conscious and unconscious perceptions of transitions. Supportive and distressing factors can also affect the experience of transitions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Identified supportive and distressing factors</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Supporting factors</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Experiencing continuity and stability as a precondition for maintaining a balance while &#x0201c;navigating unknown waters&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Adopting an active attitude towards challenging and continuously changing situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Being able to redefine normality in one&#x02019;s life situation, thereby creating new possibilities of well-being in the context of an incurable illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Acknowledging the present situation and being satisfied with it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Being able to keep hope alive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Experiencing family cohesion and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Using openness and honesty in communication to handle the situation and support each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Relying on positive memories of the past as a basis for accepting the present situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Receiving support by professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Using magical thinking and memories of the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Distressing factors</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Experiencing disruption and instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as a reason of losing one&#x02019;s balance while &#x0201c;navigating unknown waters&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Not being able to adopt an active attitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Not being able to redefine one&#x02019;s life situation in the context of an incurable illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Being exposed to distress, anxiety and uncertainty leads to a feeling of losing control because of not knowing what to expect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Vulnerability of the sick persons influence the family members&#x02019; lives and was on their mind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Experiencing fears about the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Losing hope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Experiencing a lack of family cohesion and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Missing authentic communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022; Missing support by professionals and experiencing difficulties with the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par24">Persons with palliative care needs and their family members manage the palliative situation and their transitions differently, depending on the use of resources in the family.

This relates to the varying intensity of hope in different situations, which is influenced in turn by current health status, well-being or information levels of the persons with palliative care needs.

The embers represent the core process from which four subprocesses emerge. The identified processes may change order or repeat themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Persons with palliative care needs think about the future by referring to what family members will miss about them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Persons with palliative care needs experience it as emotionally distressing to think about how daily life goes on without them. Their worries concern the response of children and parents and how they will manage the situation after death. Some persons with palliative care needs ask themselves how their children will react to their death and how they will go on living without a father or a mother. It is very important for persons with palliative care needs to be certain that their children receive support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is essential to them to remain &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; for posterity, even after their death. For example, the skills they taught their children or shared memories should be helpful for family members in their future life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Some persons with palliative care needs are sadder to leave their loved ones than they are afraid of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For others it is frightening to imagine that there is no life after death, and so they feel comfort to &#x0201c;hold on to the possibility of a something even if it was nothing tangible&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">For caring relatives, it proves very difficult to face up to a future without the deceased relative. Relatives are concerned about living without their marriage partner out of personal, practical and financial considerations. Managing the future alone is a great worry. Even while the persons with palliative care needs are still alive, they have a fearful presentiment of being lonely in the future and reflect on the consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, family caregivers try to &#x0201c;prepare&#x0201d; themselves for the imminent death of the persons with palliative care needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Being prepared</title><p id="Par39">&#x0201c;Preparing&#x0201d; oneself for loss is a significant issue for family members and informal caregivers in the context of transitions. Hebert et al. state that life experience and a long caring relationship is not sufficient to prepare for care, death and bereavement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although the awareness of the disease and its consequences exist, family members have difficulty preparing themselves, which leads to uncertainty and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">In the context of preparing, Hebert et al. identify three dimensions. The &#x0201c;cognitive dimension&#x0201d; is related to informal caregivers receiving &#x0201c;medical, practical, psychosocial, or religious/spiritual information&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The second dimension is associated with preparing &#x0201c;mentally&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;emotionally&#x0201d; in order to bid farewell to persons with palliative care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and to conclude this period of life at peace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In respect to the time after death, family members prepare themselves for the loss of roles before the situation arises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The third dimension is concerned with behavioral strategies, e.g. organizing practical matters or financial affairs. Every family member or informal caregiver uses different strategies, depending on the duration of illness, prior instructions with regard to death, as well as previous experiences with caring for a dying person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. &#x0201c;Preparing&#x0201d; starts early &#x02212; even at the time when an incurable oncologic disease is diagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Some family members or informal caregivers soon become aware of the necessity to confront the approaching loss, as well as their anxieties concerning their personal future after the death of the persons with palliative care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This &#x0201c;preparatory&#x0201d; work proves essential for accompanying the dying persons with palliative care needs, as well as for overcoming the transition associated with loss and bereavement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Accompanying the dying patient</title><p id="Par41">The time immediately before the death of the persons with palliative care needs death is extremely demanding and intense for family caregivers. The role of the caregivers expands in a proportionate relationship to the deterioration in health status of the persons with palliative care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Caregiving receives the highest priority and attention during the final weeks, days and hours in the lives of the persons with palliative care needs. Informal caregivers avoid leaving the persons with palliative care needs alone at home. The significant vulnerability of the persons with palliative care needs is constantly on their minds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The physical and emotional strain on family members and informal caregivers increases as a result. They dedicate all their energy to the persons with palliative care needs &#x02212; at the expense of their personal needs and their own health. In general, they consider their personal health less important compared to the critical situation of the persons with palliative care needs between life and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">To provide support for a dying relative, caregivers have &#x0201c;to stretch their limits of intimacy and privacy &#x0201c;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Family members describe the dying persons&#x02019; suffering as physical, emotional and/or spiritual distress. Particularly prominent for them are the strong emotions of the dying relative, expressed in a &#x0201c;dramatic physical manner, such as feelings of loss of control, anger, frustration and fear &#x0201c;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, family members try to understand the different emotions of their partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For some caregivers, &#x0201c;dying and death may be so hard to bear and to think of that families are not able to find peace in the present at all. Death is expressed as disgusting and as a termination which is almost impossible to consider&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Informal caregivers are sometimes desperate and admit to drinking alcohol to numb their thoughts or using earplugs to avoid hearing the rattle of breathing. Other thoughts are directed at violence toward other family members or shortening the care recipient&#x02019;s life. These thoughts and feelings are characterized as forbidden. Sometimes they are unable to recognize themselves based on their responses in different situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Ensuring that the dying person experiences only minimal pain and suffering is a major concern for informal caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this context, the question of sedative medication arises. Family members have an ambivalent attitude toward sedation. On the one hand, they want &#x0201c;the patient&#x02019;s suffering to end&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. On the other hand, sedation results in &#x0201c;reducing, altering, or effectively ending their communication&#x0201d; with the dying persons with palliative care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This contradicts the family member&#x02019;s wish to take over emotional and physical burdens from the dying persons with palliative care needs in order to relieve them and let them die peacefully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As this is not possible if the dying persons with palliative care needs is sedated, family members express &#x0201c;sadness and regret over their inability to communicate with their relatives before their death&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As death approaches, the need to talk to the dying relative gains increasing significance for family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the face of death, an informal caregiver stated that &#x0201c;it felt good to be together and to share thoughts and feelings with the dying loved one&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Being in close contact with the dying relative until the end is highly important for family members with regard to the transition into a completely new life situation after bereavement. Finally death is "described [as] being &#x02018;caught off guard&#x02019;" by an informal caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Finding reorientation in a new life situation</title><p id="Par44">After the death of the persons with palliative care needs, the bereaved family member or informal caregiver find themselves in a completely new life situation. The continuum &#x02212; being in continuity or disruption &#x02013; helps explain the reflections families have about life and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Being in disruption is characteristic for family members that have difficulties with accepting the situation and for whom it is challenging to find peace, while becoming overwhelmed by failings and losses. In contrast, being in continuity means being aware of the loss through death, while accepting the present and facing life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which is also described in the third subprocess of maintaining moments of hope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Consequently, people will negotiate new priorities and activities with themselves after the death of a loved one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], or family members consciously keep up traditions they once shared together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Cherished memories of their common past are a source of comfort and confidence, and spiritual concepts like &#x0201c;immortality of the souls&#x0201d; provide support when facing a life without the partner, parent or child, thus easing the passage into adjusting to this new stage of life and preserving the will to persevere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">A conceptual model was derived based on the meta-synthesis of qualitative findings (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The analysis revealed three major themes characterizing the experiences of persons with palliative care needs and their family members with regard to transitions in the palliative context. The meta-synthesis indicated three main findings. First, persons with palliative care needs and their families adapt continuously to these changed life situations by maintaining the greatest degree of normality during transitions. Second, they use different strategies to become accustomed to the situation of finding themselves in changed roles. Third, they anticipate the future &#x02013; persons with palliative care needs think about how relatives will continue without them, and relatives look ahead to their own future after their beloved family member has died.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par46">The meta-synthesis resulted in a conceptual model in which the experiences of persons with palliative care needs and their families during transitions can be described.

Other studies also demonstrate that persons with palliative care needs and their families strive for normality in the palliative context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Families use self-management strategies to adapt to transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Health care professionals can support family members and informal caregivers in their self-management strategies and therefore in maintaining normality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Within this striving for normality, persons with palliative care needs and their families try to enjoy life through living in the moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Persons with palliative care needs and their families experience a narrowing lifeworld due to the restrictions imposed by the progressing illness. Their effort to maintain normality can be seen as a strategy to counteract their narrowing lifeworld [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Efforts to make use of resources strengthened and motivated both persons with palliative care needs and family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Hence, searching for normality in crisis situations has a central role. Health care professionals must be aware that maintaining normality can be established using different strategies and resources that they can also promote.</p><p id="Par53">The meta-synthesis showed persons with palliative care needs and their families initially experience transitions unconsciously, until the situation cannot be dealt with anymore. This situation marks the transition and describes a crisis situation. Crisis can be understood as situation in which persons have to make decisions, change their behavior and find a new orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In palliative situations at home, exacerbated symptoms such as acute worsening of the health status are perceived as a crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Moreover, transitions are known to make concerned persons more vulnerable to health risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Experiencing this unprecedented situation, persons with palliative care needs and their families perceive the situation consciously and begin to adapt actively by elaborating new strategies to maintain &#x0201c;normality&#x0201d; and routines in daily life as best they can when faced with death. Therefore, transitions are an individual phenomenon that differ in number from one person to another. This result is contrasted by Penrod et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], who describe certain key transitions for informal caregivers in the patient&#x02019;s disease trajectory, from prediagnosis through to bereavement. Nevertheless, this meta-synthesis agrees with Penrod et al. by describing transitions as situations that challenge the established routine or &#x0201c;steady state&#x0201d; of the caregivers. While Penrod et al. only researched the caregivers perspective, this meta-synthesis can affirm the key process (&#x0201c;maintaining normality&#x0201d;) for persons with palliative care needs as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consequently, transitions can be seen as unavoidable, natural processes in advanced illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Persons with palliative care needs and their families all experience changing roles as the disease progresses. The meta-synthesis shows that persons with palliative care needs must deal with their role as persons with palliative care needs and their progressive inability to perform their former roles within the family. Meanwhile, family members are confronted with assuming new roles. The changing roles are a challenging experience for family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Informal caregivers who succeed in their search for normality manage to conform to the complex demands of their role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A positive decision to assume the caregivers role can be influenced by negative experiences with the residential home-care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or because it is &#x0201c;self-evident and natural to care&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Persons with palliative care needs and family members experience further alterations in well-being, habits and relationships as their roles change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Assuming the caregivers role can have profound positive changes in the relationship between persons with palliative care needs and family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The relationship can also be characterized by conversations about the illness and enduring the uncertainty of the future together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In contrast, some persons with palliative care needs do <italic>not</italic> want to talk about their illness and their imminent death. Often family members have a greater desire to talk about it, but see themselves confronted with barriers and sometimes feel isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Family members in particular may have difficulty coping with the situation of accompanying a dying person and of facing the challenging demand to assume new roles on a constant basis. Contesting changes in roles costs effort. Family members have little freedom of choice when it comes to assuming a role, as persons with palliative care needs are no longer able to fulfil their roles. Consequently, a period of transition is also a time in which family members assume new roles in a constant process of negotiating the relationship with the persons with palliative care needs.</p><p id="Par55">Also distressing and supporting factors could identified which either relieves or burdened the relatives during the transition phases. This can be explained with the concept of vulnerability. Vulnerability as a core concept was identified in a grounded theory study by Proot et al. (2003). In balancing between burden and capacity the authors found similar distressing and supporting aspects of relatives in terminal palliative care at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In our view, it is important that distressing and supportive factors in the transition phase are taken into account comprehensively.</p><p id="Par56">Anticipating the future is important for persons with palliative care needs and for family members. While persons with palliative care needs try to imagine how life will continue without them, family members try to prepare for the death of a loved one and anticipate challenges after his or her death. Family members experience a new life situation in their role as a person who will lose a close family member in the near future. Within this new role, family members start to raise questions about their future alone or about economic aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. They think about how they can continue in the absence of their loved ones with palliative care needs. Awaiting imminent death is taxing for persons with palliative care needs and their family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Anticipating the future is combined with many feelings such as uncertainty, fear and loneliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Further research will be necessary in order to address the issue of offering adequate support to family members and persons with palliative care needs.</p><p id="Par57">This meta-synthesis enabled the derivation of a conceptual model about experiences of persons with palliative care needs and family members during transitions in the palliative context. A meta-synthesis helps to obtain a higher degree of abstraction. Nevertheless, the quality of the meta-synthesis may be limited by its dependence on the quality of the included studies. Furthermore, it was not possible to conduct the originally planned mixed-methods studies review due to the poor quality of the studies. Moreover, qualitative studies with moderate to insufficient quality have been integrated, as they held relevant content.</p><p id="Par58">The findings help nurses to acquire understanding for persons with palliative care needs and their families in the palliative situation. As transitions result in a situation of change for the concerned persons, the knowledge about transitions can help nurses to recognize a transition. Consequently, they can assist those concerned in maintaining normality and designing strategies to adapt to transitions. Furthermore, they can support them in finding solutions, new strategies and in dealing with the situation, as they are familiar with the needs and experiences of concerned persons and their families in palliative situations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">This study shows how persons with palliative care needs and their families experience transitions in a palliative context. Maintaining normality, experiencing changing roles and anticipating the future are central phenomena for these groups. The derived model of experiencing transitions in palliative situations shows a deviating view on transitions compared to the one promoted in traditional models. The results can help health care professionals understand persons with palliative care needs and their families. The health care professionals can use this understanding to offer targeted services, enabling the development of tailored education and counselling offers for persons with palliative care needs and family members/informal caregivers. The conceptual model assists in comprehending the experiences of persons with palliative care needs and their family members. Based on this model, health care professionals can identify available resources and support the family in their self-management strategies.</p><p id="Par60">Further research is required to investigate the individual implications of bereavement after loved ones with palliative care needs have died. Given that a life-limiting illness has consequences for the family as a whole, another important topic will be to explore the changes within the lifeworld of persons with palliative care needs and family members as an integral unit.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Fanny Wolfensperger and Regula Steiner for their peer support and assistance in researching and analyzing the articles.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par61">The study was not supported by funding.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par62">The data used are the named studies and are available under the given references.
