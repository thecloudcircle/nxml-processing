These strategies include: addressing the vulnerabilities of PwDs living in disaster-prone countries; the use of PwDs&#x02019; experiences and perceptions of prior disasters; addressing barriers to disaster preparedness; and preparing for disasters by the use of services offered to PwDs during disasters such as voluntary service, accessibility to communications and government/NGO rescue personnel [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite efforts in the area of disaster preparedness, often PwDs are left behind, overlooked, marginalised, and discriminated against [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The World Report on Disability states that 15% (est. 480 million) of the world&#x02019;s population are disabled persons, with 8% of that population living in developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 350 million people living with some form of disability globally are affected by natural disasters annually [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is estimated that these numbers will increase due to ageing, lifestyle diseases, poverty, and accidents [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Historically, PwDs are disproportionately affected by disasters as they have various functional limitations and are more likely to be socially isolated and live in poverty [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With various functional limitations, their needs differ within the different types of disabilities and the degree of disability. For instance, a visually impaired person may respond by hearing about the warnings from television or radio of an impending disaster. This may be harder with a deaf and cognitively impaired individual to decide for themselves as they would rely solely on their carer to assist with the evacuation [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The factors causing vulnerability of PwDs to disasters are structural determinants, including social, political, economic, cultural, and environmental contexts which can influence the outcome of individuals when encountering disasters [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To reduce disaster risk and vulnerability amongst PwDs, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) advocates risk reduction by the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and other international agreements [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are vastly dispersed in the Pacific Ocean, which covers thirty percent of the global surface [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These island countries are not only different in their geographic spread across the Pacific but also topographically different, being categorised into 'continental islands', 'oceanic islands', and 'raised limestone islands' [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Living in these islands can exacerbate PwDs vulnerability as these islands are highly exposed and frequently experience severe disasters [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to the 2012 World Risk Report, PICs are among the most at-risk countries from disaster, which was based on exposures to hazard, susceptibility, lack of coping capacities, and adaptive capacities [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Surviving disasters in Tuvalu, a low-lying country with narrow coral atolls that sits barely three metres above sea level, can be a challenge for PwDs as many are unemployed, discriminated against, poorly educated, and frequently excluded from disaster management processes [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The vulnerabilities PwDs experience in the islands will increase as the frequency and intensity of disasters in the Pacific Island Countries will increase over the next decade [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>There are limited studies on how PwDs experience changes to risk perceptions, with prior experience of a disaster playing a key role in determining preparedness [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For instance, PwDs were more responsive and prepared for disasters only after the 2010 earthquake experience in Canterbury, New Zealand [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Disaster experience of PwDs in evacuation centres provides valuable insight into construction that considers the availability of essential facilities such as toilets, social and support services, and understanding cultures and norms within societies [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Studies have shown that experience, education, and trust in authorities have a substantial impact on preparedness [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, these perceptions are reinforced or modified through media reports, peer influences, and other communication processes [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) stipulate non-discrimination, full and effective participation in society, respect of children and their rights, equality of opportunity, and accessibility [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, globally, employment rates are among the lowest for PwDs with low socioeconomic status compared to their able-bodied counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As a consequence of being unemployed, accessing health and education can be difficult given that they cannot afford to pay their bus fares to hospitals, transportation, medical treatment, medicines, and inclusive education [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the event of a disaster, emergency systems for alerting deaf individuals play a critical role in evacuation. The lack of information impacts the level of knowledge about disasters. This in turn increases PwDs vulnerability to disasters as they would not know what the disaster is and how to prevent or protect themselves from it [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The lack of assistance and information cost the lives of PwDs in Sri Lanka as they did not understand the information to evacuate during the 2015 Tsunami [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Another barrier affecting PwDs is the exclusion from decision making during disaster management planning and delivery. Specifically, they are rarely involved in disaster management planning despite inclusive advocacy, and guidelines on the inclusion of PwDs that were never implemented during the tsunami in Asia, including the process of post-tsunami reconstruction [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PwDs inclusion in disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction management practices at all stages of disaster will enhance their resilience, accessibility to information, and improve preparedness efforts for disasters and reduces stigmatization and discrimination [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Disaster preparedness involves establishing warning systems, mapping out evacuation routes, and educating families to maintain essential supplies and procedures to inform leaders of the communities in the event of a disaster [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Preparing PwDs can be influenced by knowledge, information, and communication. Knowledge plays a crucial role in reducing risk from disasters and is fundamental for informed decision making and the transfer of information. Studies have shown that there are clear benefits and advantages of both conventional scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge in making decisions about disaster preparedness and reducing risk to disasters [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Information and communication are effective tools in reaching out to the public and warning them of impending disasters. For PwDs, efforts to warn and prepare them requires effective risk communication strategies [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; information that is accessible and understandable [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]; effective communication from trustworthy sources [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; and the use of supportive policies and regulations [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The WHO and IFRC advocate specific methods of communicating with PwDs including audio signals, visual aids such as signs and gestures, and printed materials such as posters, leaflets, and pictures [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>With the paucity of research on PwDs and disasters in Tuvalu and other PICs, this study has the potential to raise awareness and contribute to the body of knowledge of the challenges faced by PwDs living in developing countries during disasters. The evidence in this study will further provide knowledge in preparing and reducing PwDs risk from disasters as required by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The Sendai Framework for Disaster in its Guiding Principles in Paragraph 19(g) states the importance of using inclusive risk-formed data to reduce risk during disasters for PwDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design sample selection</title><p>A qualitative grounded theory approach was chosen for the study.

Tuvalu is made up of 9 coral islands and the researcher travelled by government vessels to interview participants on four islands including Funafuti, Nukufetau, Vaitupu, and Nui. To facilitate proper interviews, the venues are important and outer island clinics were chosen as they provided a conducive environment for PwDs. Interviews on Funafuti were carried out in two venues: at the Disabled Persons Organisation Centre &#x0201c;Fusi Alofa," as the majority were familiar with the environment, and at homes for those participants who preferred interviews at their own homes.</p><p>Data was collected using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) from the 20th March to 10th April 2017.

The purpose of the translated questionnaires to the local language was to ensure participants understood the questions as well as giving truthful responses. After the translation, a second independent translator back-translated to English and then further compared with the original. The researcher consulted with translators and worked on addressing the differences in translation and agreed on a translation that worked well with Tuvaluan language and context [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The translated questionnaires were then pretested on 5 participants including physically disabled and hard-of-hearing disabled persons. Participants from general populations were included in the pre-test to cater to carers and sign language users who would be involved in the actual data collection interviews. Comments from the participants were reviewed and incorporated in the final questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study procedure</title><p>Each participant registered at the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Fusi Alofa was invited to the health clinic and given an information sheet and written consent form. The participant or carer signed the consent if they agreed to participate. For ethical considerations, participants who gave their consent were screened for PTSD symptoms by the nurse or health practitioner. It was critical that participants with PTSD were excluded, as recalling lived experiences can trigger terrifying events that could further debilitate their mental health conditions As such, those participants with symptoms were excluded while those without were further informed verbally regarding the study, how they were to contribute to the study and that all information provided would be kept strictly confidential. Participants on the capital with mobility issues were interviewed by the investigator at their homes and the rest of the participants were interviewed at the PwDs centre.</p><p>The participants in the interviews on the island of Funafuti were recruited to participate in the FGD. There were 31 interviewees of whom 21 had a physical impairment, 2 were blind and 8 were deaf or hard-of-hearing. Seven participated in the only FGD of which 5 had physical disabilities, 1 was blind and 1 deaf. There were challenges during the interviews, but a sign language translator assisted with the deaf person&#x02019;s interview, sitting close to the participant so they could hear properly, and visiting homes to interview those who had physical impairments to successfully collect data. Transportation was arranged for participants to travel to the disabled person&#x02019;s centre for the FGD. There were no FGDs on the islands of Nukufetau, Nui, and Vaitupu, as there were a limited number of PwDs on the islands.</p><p>The in-depth interviews started by greeting the participant and making them feel comfortable by talking about the weather. As soon as the participants had settled, the investigator introduced himself and the purpose of the study, which was the study on disability and their experience and clarifying the procedures of the interview. The participants were then informed that they could withdraw from the interview if they were uncomfortable with the questions. A series of questions were then asked based on the preparation guide and the participants were given ample time to respond to each question. They were not pressured to answer immediately, and this was particularly useful for participants who were deaf or hard of hearing, as an interpreter was used to convey the questions to the participant as well as interpreting to the researcher.</p><p>The FGD used the PwDs Centre computer room where the researcher greeted the participants, followed by the introduction of the study. As most participants were involved in the in-depth interview, the investigator briefly introduced the purpose of discussions followed by the discussion using a discussion guide. The investigator encouraged participants to share their views as there were no right or wrong answers. Their answers only reflect their individual experiences of disasters.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Data collection</title><p>The interviews were recorded using a recorder, and the researcher used a notebook to take memos for each interview. The average time for the 31 interviews was 10.85 minutes with the longest being 20.19 minutes and the length of the FGD being 54.32 minutes. The interview data were transcribed verbatim on the night of each interview by the investigator. The transcribed data were then translated to English by a bilingual translator at the end of the final transcription of interview data for final analysis. These transcripts were then cross translated by another bilingual translator checking for consistency with the Tuvalu version. Any discrepancies in the translation to English were discussed between the translators and researcher and amendments were made accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data were analysed manually at the beginning of the process using individual interview transcripts. Each transcript was read for familiarity and coding followed thereafter. The codes were &#x0201c;constantly compared&#x0201d; during the process and according to Charmaz, [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] constant comparison of codes is the process of checking how codes or categories hold up against all interview data and previous data. If the codes were similar, then one can be used and the other dropped. All codes were important, and the researcher had to check and verify that it was frequently mentioned in the data to warrant its place in the final selection of themes. The transcripts were analysed using a thematic inductive analysis approach based on Grounded Theory, where categories and themes are cited directly as emerging themes from the data and not from preconceived hypotheses [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The next step was to search for themes within the code and review to ensure they represent views of the majority of participants. The themes were then defined, and categories developed to best capture the experiences of participants. Quotations were labelled based on the number of participants as P1, P2, etc.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Researcher and training</title><p>The researcher carried out all fieldwork including interviews and facilitating the group discussions.

The findings concur with international agreements and studies that show how governments should involve PwDs in developing capacities of PwDs and disability organisations, as well as developing inclusive disaster preparedness programs [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These findings are important for PwDs so that governments recognise and develop strategies to assist in preparing them for disasters.</p><p>Capacity development was important to PwDs, particularly when it comes to evacuation. Evacuation drills increased knowledge within PwDs as well as the communities assisting them during evacuation. However, this study found that the abled-bodied training participants needed an in-depth understanding of different types of disabilities. During disaster evacuation, PwDs have different needs and evacuation teams need to understand them so that they don&#x02019;t get injured in the process. The Sendai Framework advocates that DRR activities such as evacuation drills are required to empower people who are disproportionately affected by disasters including the disabled and the poor [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Another factor that contributes to the preparedness of PwDs is their participation in communities, government, and NGO policy development and decision-making. Participants in this study shared their stories about how they are now participating in government policy developments and community meetings, but more advocacy is needed. The finding is consistent with studies showing that participating in community decision making empowers PwDs to increase their chances of preparing for disasters [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The International Handicap also supports this finding, noting that PwDs should participate in decision-making at all stages of humanitarian response during and after disasters so that authorities would understand their needs [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>PwDs are a heterogeneous group that requires different disability communication approaches and correct methods of communicating information determine their understanding and ability to evacuate in time [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This present study showed that methods to deliver the message to PwDs is critical and proposes methods to reach out to these individuals. These methods consider communication with the caregiver, proximity of announcements, use of local language, and sign language. These results are consistent with studies on risk communication with disabled communities [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Participants in this study identified the following barriers that hinder preparedness efforts: lack of planning to prepare for disasters, both for families and government or NGO; unemployment; and needing assistance to evacuate in the event of a disaster. The findings from this study are comparable with the current literature in reports and studies on barriers to disaster preparedness [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The types of barriers commonly experienced by PwDs include attitudinal, communication, physical, policy, programmatic, social, and transportation issues [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Studies in the Pacific Islands identified that PwDs, specifically children and youth, are marginalised within their communities and the majority are unemployed, making it hard to buy necessities [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, marginalisation and discrimination may not improve PwDs participation in community decision-making and will consequently affect their preparations for disasters.</p><p>Understanding the role of unemployment in PwDs during a disaster is crucial. This study found that over 90% of participants were unemployed, which is consistent with reports on the PwDs employment rate [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Studies confirmed that PwDs have a consistently low socioeconomic status (low SES), are mostly unemployed, are less educated, and face health and financial challenges [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Without financial resources, PwDs are not able to buy food, water, and other essential items to prepare for disasters. Studies have also confirmed that by developing policies to protect the rights of PwDs, improving their job opportunities, and prioritising and responding to their needs will address inclusivity issues among general populations [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>This study has also shown that PwDs require assistance to evacuate during disasters. Preparing PwDs would require families as first responders to disasters, as well as government and NGO assistance. The result is consistent with studies of individuals with physical disabilities requiring assistance to evacuate [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Most of the participants in this present study stated that they would need assistance during disasters and these perceptions are somewhat accurate, given that most of them asserted that during disasters, &#x02018;what else can they do&#x02019; but to ask for assistance. Dunn found that the reliance of PwDs on assistance was a barrier, which is similar to the findings of this study [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>This study found three factors for motivation to prepare: to stay alive; Te Valo (local alert system); and faith in God. Pacific Island culture and traditions have significant mechanisms to assist in preparing communities and families including disabled people for disasters [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Motivation to prepare is affected by how one views the risks of disasters [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given the limited studies on PwDs and their behaviour, our finding is only consistent with general population studies, noting that they were motivated because of family safety, knowledge, information, and praying as a coping strategy [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>This study found various sources of information that are trustworthy such as government departments including the police, weather, and the community alert system. Studies have shown that trusted sources are an important component of disaster preparedness [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Trust is diminished when the delivery of a message is delayed, as noted by this study. Nevertheless, by trusting the sources of information on impending disasters and appropriate communication with PwDs contributes to the preparedness and mitigation of disaster effects.</p><p>Scientific and traditional knowledge are both important factors in preparing for disasters. This study has shown that participants' perceived knowledge, concerning knowing disaster types, responding to and preparing for disasters, were contributing factors to disaster preparedness for PwDs. These findings are broadly consistent with current literature, where knowledge was seen as a key dimension or desired end-state of preparedness activities [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>The findings from this study have shown that experiences are important factors in disaster preparations. According to the data, those with different types of disability perceived disasters are prone to differ from each other. The participants&#x02019; reactions to disasters in this study are consistent with studies on the influence of experience in the formation of risk perceptions and disaster preparedness strategies [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Experiencing an injury can also increase the perception of vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. PwDs are a diverse group, and as such, meeting their needs is not as easy as applying a one-size-fits-all model, but rather requires tailored assistance for different disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The findings from experiences of PwDs showed how they use the knowledge of different types of disasters to prepare for disaster. Studies with similar findings found how experiences in disasters have influenced how they used that knowledge to help others, as well as developing preparedness plans [<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0241180.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This study has shown that the experiences of PwDs about disasters must not be neglected but rather encouraged in terms of the participation and inclusion of PwDs in decision and policymaking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec033"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Persons with disabilities are amongst the most vulnerable segment within the general population. They must receive continuous support to prepare for disasters. This study showed factors that contribute to the preparedness of PwDs in disasters, perspectives on preparedness and understanding lived experience in disasters. The factors contributing to their preparedness are capacity development in an evacuation, participation in government and Non-government organisations and community decision-making, and the use of suitable methods of communication. Understanding barriers that hinder these preparations are illustrated by not having a disaster plan, the impact of being unemployed, and the need for assistance to evacuate. Perceiving risk as a preparedness measure for disasters also motivates PwDs to stay alive for families, use trusted sources of information, and trust in God. Lived experiences brought a variety of valuable perspectives on different types of disabilities and types of disaster experiences. Further studies are recommended in the areas of policies and socioeconomic analysis, using phenomenological approaches to describe the meaning of lived experiences of PwDs and how tacit knowledge can be used in decision-making. This research suggests that government, Non-government organisations, communities, and families maintain assistance in preparing PwDs for disasters by addressing the factors that contribute to preparedness and the barriers and challenges.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the participants for taking out their valuable time and participating in the interview.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0241180.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">B&#x000fc;ndnis EH.

Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions.

Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available.

Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;In relation to question 3 above i assume all data are held by the appropriate departments who employ the authors. presumably the data are also confidential.</p><p>in relation to question 2 above, the surveyed population was small in size, but acceptable. More sophisticated statistics would not have enhanced the analysis.</p><p>In relation to question 4 above, the manuscript is intelligible but there are many mistakes. I have converted the pdf to Word and used track changes to suggest recommended corrections to the English expression. I have also inserted a number of review comments on specific statements. This copy of the paper is uploaded for your guidance in making corrections.</p><p>The results section could benefit from some reduction in length. It is a bit tedious and repetitive in several places.</p><p>The discussion section is very clearly stated and well connected to findings from the general literature.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This study investigates an understudied geographical area and vulnerable group of individuals with disabilities. The manuscript, after the revisions and addressing the comments from the previous reviewers, is sound and the data support the conclusion.</p><p>Please make adjustment to Focus Group Discussion and its abbreviation FDG. You may change it to FGD to be consistent with the order of words.</p><p>[Focus Group Discussion (FDG) in Abstract and Focus Group Discussions (FDG) in Table 2]</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;I have read the MS in depth and also the previous reviewers' comments and author responses. The authors' changes appear to well address the reviewers comments and i feel the MS is now a topical, socially valuable, and methodologically sound piece of work meriting publication. Articulating PwDs lived experiences of disasters and their suggestions for future disaster planning is very valuable for improving future disaster response/management strategies for this group. There are still some english and small grammatical issues that need attending to,</p><p>Suggestions;</p><p>P 2. Abstract: Conclusion, first sentence needs reworking to clarify meaning. "This study highlights the salience in understanding PwDs prepare and experience, which influences their resilience to disasters". Maybe change to something like "This study highlights the importance of understanding PwDs' lived disaster experience to improve their preparedness and resilience for future disasters".</p><p>P 6. Line 5 in Methodology. Insert sample size (31) "Purposive sampling was used to select "31" participants..."</p><p>P 8. Line 8. insert apostrophe after "researcher". "....the researcher's personal experience...."</p><p>P 9. Line 3. Change "participants understanding" to "participants understood"</p><p>P 9. Line 4. Change "translator translated back to english.." to "...translator back-translated to english.."</p><p>P 9. Lines 9 &#x00026; 15. Change "users that" and participants that" to "users who... and "participants who..."</p><p>P 10. line 7. Change "interviews..." to "interviewees..."</p><p>P 11. Line 3. Change heading "Data management and analysis" to "Data Collection"</p><p>P 11. Insert heading ""Data Analysis" between lines 11 &#x00026; 12.</p><p>P 13. Line 1. Change "The themes from this study..." to "The themes to emerge from this study..."</p><p>P 14. Lines 1 to 3.
