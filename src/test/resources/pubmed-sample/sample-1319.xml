By the year 2050, an estimated 10 million deaths worldwide per year could be attributed to bacterial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The World Health Organization has declared multi-drug resistant (MDR) <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> a priority 1 critical pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Underpinning such concern is the paucity of new therapeutic agents in the development pipeline to treat infections with MDR <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. This is due, at least in part, to the highly impermeable outer membrane (OM) and robust efflux systems in this Gram-negative pathogen that together can prevent antibacterial small molecules from accumulating in cells sufficiently to engage intracellular targets. The OM is asymmetrical and consists of an inner leaflet of phospholipid and an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Biosynthesis of LPS and its assembly into the outer leaflet of the OM are essential for growth in most Gram-negative bacteria and have been the focus of intense interest for novel antibacterial discovery (e.g. the lipid A biosynthetic target LpxC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and the OM assembly target LptD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par3">LPS consists of a lipid A anchor, which forms the outer leaflet of the OM, attached to a polysaccharide core region linked to repeating polysaccharide O-antigen units that extend out from the cell surface. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> LPS is notable for its highly phosphorylated LPS core region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and magnesium ions are thought to crosslink these phosphates to more tightly pack adjacent LPS molecules than in other Gram-negative bacteria. This serves to increase the OM permeability barrier which contributes to the high intrinsic drug resistance of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Most of the enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of the core sugar moiety of LPS are encoded in a single gene cluster and may be associated in a protein complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This cluster includes at least three kinase genes (<italic>waaP</italic>, <italic>wapP</italic>, and <italic>wapQ</italic>) involved in phosphorylation of LPS core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. WaaP, a cytoplasmic soluble protein, phosphorylates the first heptose sugar of LPS inner core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which appears to be required for subsequent core phosphorylation steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Lipid A core biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol with later steps, such as core phosphorylation (by WaaP and other LPS kinases), occurring on the lipid-A core associated with the inner leaflet of the inner membrane. This nascent LPS species is then flipped to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane where O-antigen is attached in the periplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The fully decorated LPS molecule is then transported to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane through the Lpt transportation machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Importantly, WaaP (and WapP) is essential for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and as such constitute attractive anti-pseudomonal drug targets. The WaaP primary amino acid sequence shares homology to eukaryotic protein tyrosine kinases within its kinase active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The expanding knowledge of structure-based design of selective kinase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> could be leveraged in the design of WaaP inhibitors. Here, we report the first X-ray crystallographic structure of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> WaaP, expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which revealed a very tight and novel complexation with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> acylated acyl-carrier protein (acyl-ACP). We further confirmed that acyl-ACP was indeed complexed with WaaP at physiologically relevant levels of WaaP expression in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. ACP normally shuttles acyl chains (attached to ACP via a phosphopentatheine linkage) to various acyl-transferases involved in fatty acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and polyketide biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and the interaction of acyl-ACP with acyl-transferases is typically transient. However, here we discovered that acyl-ACP acts as a very tightly bound cofactor necessary for the production and stability of active WaaP kinase, uncovering a new function for acyl-ACP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Acyl-ACP/ WaaP crystal structure</title><p id="Par4">We expressed C-terminal hexa-histidine tagged <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> WaaP (1&#x02013;264) in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and purified it over four columns to near homogeneity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

The anomalous diffraction signal from selenium identified a total of 6 sites in the asymmetric unit; however WaaP-His contained only 5 methionine residues. Initial solvent flattened electron density maps enabled the building of over 80% of the WaaP kinase structure but a large amount of unaccounted for density, containing the extra selenomethionine and a three-helical bundle, was evident. This unaccounted density was identified as being acyl carrier protein with an acyl chain modification (acyl-ACP). Purified WaaP-His run on gels designed to visualize low molecular weight proteins indeed showed a lower migrating band.

The COOH-terminal lobe was further divided into two sub-domains: the first sub-domain (I) (119-218) had structural homology to EPKs and the second sub-domain (II) (218-263) was composed of a novel arrangement of three helices, forming a channel through which a tube of electron density (approximately 20&#x02009;&#x000c5; long and 7&#x02009;&#x000c5; wide) extended into the COOH-terminal sub-domain I, ending under the kinase active site pocket.

The ACP molecule bound to WaaP adopted a tertiary structure most similar to the form A crystals of butyryl-ACP (PDBID: 1l0h)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, with an RMSD of 0.7&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for all C&#x003b1; atoms, that reflected a closed and empty hydrophobic cavity within ACP.

This is likely because it is a small (~9&#x02009;kDa), acidic, and highly soluble protein that is difficult to visualize in typical SDS-PAGE analysis.

We used the novel crystal structure identified here to guide the characterization of the kinase function of WaaP and to better understand the nature of its interaction with acyl-ACP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>WaaP kinase domain</title><p id="Par7">We first sought to define residues necessary for WaaP kinase function based on structural homology to classic EPKs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Previous reports have described WaaP as a novel dual function protein that can auto-phosphorylate at tyrosine residues and phosphorylate sugar (heptose I of LPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We found no evidence of protein phosphorylation by MS analysis (for either WaaP or ACP) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Structurally, the EPK-family residues required for ATP binding and phosphotransferase were mostly present, however important differences were observed that placed WaaP in the eukaryotic protein kinase-like (ELK) family. Conserved residues included: the T114 gatekeeper residue; the hinge extending from E116 to P119, the &#x0201c;glycine-rich loop&#x0201d; contained a single glycine, G35, at its apex; the catalytically invariant lysine K51 was engaged by the side-chain of E78 from the NH-terminal of &#x003b1;C-helix. Residues D188, L189, and H190 represented the DFG motif on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding activation loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>; and H161, R162 and D163 represented the HRD motif (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These key kinase residues (K51, E78, H<sup>161</sup>RD, D<sup>188</sup>FG) were well conserved in WaaP homologs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The positioning of the catalytic lysine K51 (previously identified to be K69, see below) and D188 is consistent with an EPK-like mechanism of ATP &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-phosphate engagement and substrate hydroxyl interaction, respectively. Differences from classic EPK structure elements included the novel COOH-terminal sub-domain, a modified Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding activation loop where histidine (H168 in WaaP) coordinated to the second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in place of a conserved asparagine residue (N171 in protein kinase A), and a shortened, structured WaaP activation loop lacking EPK regulatory elements. This was consistent with a fact that we did not observe phosphorylation of WaaP. The residues in the activation loop normally modified by phosphorylation to enable regulation of catalytic activity were replaced by two buried threonine residues (T194 packed against &#x003b1;C-helix and T198). The key &#x003b1;-helical elements involved in catalytic activity from the C-terminal lobe of EPK family members (on helices &#x003b1;E- and &#x003b1;F) were present in WaaP, such as the D206 (from &#x003b1;F-helix) interaction with the main-chain of H161 in the HRD motif (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the GHI-helical subdomain responsible for the regulation and substrate recognition of EPK proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> was replaced in WaaP by a novel 3-helical fold comprising the acyl-ACP interacting COOH-terminal sub-domain II of WaaP. The acyl chain attached to ACP projected between &#x003b1;E- and &#x003b1;F helices (see below). No residues were observed that would indicate an acyl transfer capacity for WaaP.

Since WaaP is essential for growth in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, the ability to turn off expression of the native WaaP provided a way to assess whether WaaP variants were functional, based on their ability to support growth. Downregulation of native WaaP expression also increased the cells susceptibility to EDTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, where presumably a lower EDTA MIC correlates to a lower amount of phosphorylated LPS in the outer membrane. This enabled more subtle defects in the activity of WaaP variants to be detected via increased susceptibility to EDTA. The impact of amino acid substitutions at several key residues (K51A, E78A, H161A, R162A, D163A and D188N) on bacterial growth and susceptibility to EDTA compared to wild type (WT) WaaP is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. As expected, cells expressing WT WaaP grew and were relatively resistant to EDTA (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5&#x02009;mM). Most of the variants of structurally-predicted essential kinase residues could not support growth and cells expressing the E78A WaaP variant were at least two orders of magnitude more sensitive to EDTA (MIC&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.04&#x02009;mM EDTA; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

The hydrophilic PPI was formed by interactions between the negatively charged surface of ACP (residues D35, E41, E47, E48, E53 and D56) with a positively charged surface on WaaP (residues K140, R141, R221, R222, R226, R229 and R237). The acyl-ACP/WaaP interaction could not be characterized by the simple deletion or depletion of ACP, since ACP interactions with a range of protein partners are necessary for cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, we chose to make variants of WaaP to evaluate the importance of the positively charged PPI surface for WaaP function and stability in our cell-based assays. As described above, kinase function was measured as the ability of WaaP variants to support growth of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and to mediate EDTA resistance, and stability was estimated by western blot analysis. WaaP variants designed to disrupt the interface, by substituting neutral Ala or charge-inverted Glu residues, were generated both individually and in combination and assessed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The WaaP variants R222E, R226E, and R222A/R226A were stable and supported cell growth and wild type levels of EDTA susceptibility. The double R222E/R226E variant was less stable in cells (but still supported growth), however, the susceptibility of cells to EDTA was increased 16-fold consistent with a reduced kinase activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Enriching for substitutions from positively charged Arg to negatively charged Glu within the PPI (R222E/ R226E/R237E and R221E/R222E/R226E/R229E/R237E) progressively decreased WaaP stability and cellular function to the point that R221E/R222E/R226E/R229E/R237E could not support growth in the WaaP controlled expression strain. This indicated that the WaaP protein-protein interaction with ACP is necessary to maintain active WaaP and furthermore, as predicted, the interaction is very difficult to disrupt. As with the analyses of the kinase domain above, the results were mirrored by the orthogonal <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cellular assay (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), further supporting the notion that disrupting interaction at the WaaP/ACP PPI decreased soluble and functional WaaP protein levels leading to a corresponding reduction of membrane integrity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Protein-protein interaction interface between acyl-ACP and WaaP.

WaaP variants altered at residues in the hydrophobic channel were designed to perturb the regions corresponding to the terminal end of the lipid (L143W, S127L), the mid-pocket area (L219W, V147L, A214L, A214W, V147W, V147L/L219W, V147W/A214F) and the solvent-exposed opening of the tunnel proximal to the phosphopantetheine-ACP acyl chain attachment site (L228A, L228W). Changes at either end of the hydrophobic tunnel had little impact on WaaP stability and function (S127L, L228A, L228W). Variants altered at residues lining the middle of the hydrophobic tunnel ranged from fully stable and functional to non-stable and non-functional (e.g. V147W and V147W/A214F, predicted to bisect the hydrophobic tunnel) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

Intriguingly, dramatic hydrophobic core substitutions such as L219W were tolerated, suggesting that WaaP stability/function does not depend on a specific acyl-chain length.

Structural alignments of the ACP proteins with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ACP (not shown) suggested that AcpP and Acp1, but not Acp3, possessed residues that could potentially interact with WaaP. To confirm the existence of an acyl-ACP/WaaP complex and identify the specific acyl-ACP species bound to WaaP in the physiologically relevant context of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> cells, His-tagged WaaP was expressed and pulled down from exponentially growing <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> cells using IMAC followed by MS analysis of co-eluted proteins. MS peaks consistent with WaaP (31,572&#x02009;Da) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>) and additional peaks were observed with masses clustering around 9200 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The protein masses of the peaks matched acyl-AcpP carrying several acyl chain lengths whereas masses consistent with Acp1 and Acp3 were not observed. Overnight treatment of the sample with DTT to cleave the thioester bond and release the acyl chain caused the collapse of MS peaks assigned as acyl-AcpP species into a single peak for holo-AcpP, confirming the MS peak identification of the various acyl-ACP species (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c,d</xref>). This suggested that WaaP can bind various acyl-AcpP species, consistent with our observation above that the WaaP hydrophobic channel could tolerate amino acid substitutions. The most abundant ACP species pulled down from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> was palmitoyl (C16:0)-AcpP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Palmitic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and this chain length is consistent with the acyl chain of acyl-ACP assigned in the crystal structure. Intriguingly, the second most abundant species was myristyl-AcpP (C14:0; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), even though myristic acid comprises only 0.6% of the fatty acid pool in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, WaaP-His expressed at ~40-fold lower protein levels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) co-eluted only with the myristyl-AcpP as measured by MS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This suggests that WaaP acquired abundant acyl-ACP species when overexpressed but preferentially bound myristyl-ACP at lower expression levels which may be more reflective of endogenous WaaP levels. Since the peak was small, we confirmed the presence of AcpP by trypsin digest and MS/MS peptide analysis (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). There was no evidence for phosphorylation of AcpP or acyl transfer to WaaP, consistent with our hypothesis that acyl-AcpP stabilizes WaaP rather than acting as a substrate.

The WaaP crystal structure showed a protein fold that is homologous to EPKs in the NH-terminal lobe and sub-domain I of the COOH-terminal lobe. The catalytic core of the protein kinase family was mostly conserved and demonstrated to be essential for WaaP cellular function, suggesting a conserved EPK-like mechanism of ATP dependent phosphotransfer. The canonical EPKs also contain regulatory mechanisms mediated by the catalytic loop which were not present in WaaP. The human kinome has been annotated to contain several protein kinase families that similarly diverge and WaaP shared the most structural similarity with the Rio family of atypical kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

This unique sub-domain II of WaaP&#x02019;s COOH-terminal lobe formed an internal channel, where the acyl chain attached to ACP was buried. WaaP presented a highly positively charged polar protein surface where ACP made a highly charged-complimentary PPI. The remaining solvent exposed positively-charged surface of WaaP is presumably required for recognition of the negatively-charged substrate (lipid A-core-sugar) similar to the site postulated for substrate recognition of the LPS core sugar glycosyltransferase, WaaG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">We initially uncovered the WaaP/acyl-ACP interaction while solving the WaaP crystal structure utilizing an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> overexpression system.

Further hydrophobic interactions between the acyl chain and residues in the hydrophobic tunnel of WaaP serve to strengthen the acyl-ACP/WaaP association. Consistent with this, the complex survived extensive purification under high salt conditions and pulldown experiments invariably yielded an acyl-AcpP/WaaP complex. The complex PPI region of WaaP had to be extensively altered to observe an impact on the stability of acyl-AcpP/WaaP and correspondingly its ability to support cell growth. Furthermore, soluble WaaP could only be synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of acyl-ACP. This unusually strong protein-protein interaction therefore is required to maintain WaaP in a soluble active state.</p><p id="Par16">It is always tempting to propose a regulatory role in cases of protein-protein interactions. For example, acyl-ACP is a suspected regulator of SpoT based on protein associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and this may also be the case here. The connection between LPS synthesis (lipid A) and phospholipid synthesis, which both utilize acyl-ACP, and the need to balance these processes to maintain inner and outer membrane homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, may support such possibilities. Furthermore, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> LPS contains only C10:0 and C12:0 acyl chains whereas quantifiable acyl-ACP species associated with WaaP pulled down from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> contained longer acyl chains (C14:0 &#x02013; C18:0), supporting the possibility that WaaP stability is linked to a pathway other than LPS biosynthesis. Any such interrelationships, and the possible role of factors controlling the abundance of various acyl-AcpP species that may control WaaP function would warrant further study. In addition, the interaction with acyl-ACP mediated by the unique kinase structural motifs of WaaP could conceivably regulate enzyme function and substrate recognition. Another possibility is that this interaction has evolved primarily to maintain a pool of active, but potentially low-abundance, WaaP via this extremely stable complex. The unusually large PPI and hydrophobic tunnel region mediating the interaction may suggest continual selective pressure favoring increased tightness over time. The interaction is clearly unrelated to acyl-transfer normally mediated by acyl-ACP and indeed the acyl chain is itself specifically exploited to strengthen the interaction with WaaP, with the acyl chain being protected in a dedicated hydrophobic tunnel.
