Data were collected through face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire was developed to discover the acceptance of GPC and covered three parts: respondents&#x02019; socio-demographic characteristics, health service utilization, and the patients&#x02019; assessment of primary health care centers. A binary logistic regression model was used to measure the influencing factors of respondents&#x02019; acceptance of GPC policy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 611(60.5%) participants accepted GPC policy.

Due to the fast population aging, increasing incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases, and the rocketing health expenditure, an effective health care delivery model that provides accessible and affordable services for the whole population is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The evidence from more than 50 countries has proved that PHC provided by a fixed general practitioner (GP) was more effective in improving accessibility, reducing costs, and improving the patients&#x02019; health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a mature and stable primary health care system, a relatively long-term and stable relationship between patients and qualified GP teams could be restrained through a service contract with an integrated supply of public health and essential medical services. Countries such as Britain and Australia have adopted the models of a mandatory contract between GPs and patients, while some countries, including France, have utilized voluntary contract models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">After China&#x02019;s market-oriented economic reforms in the early 1980s, the three-tier health care system formed in the 1970s went collapsed, which caused the disorders of patients&#x02019; health-seeking behaviors and irrational use of health care resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. After more than 20&#x02009;years&#x02019; health care system reform, evidence has proved that the well-functioned three-level health care system is still an effective way to serve the large population of China&#x02019;s health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the goal of China&#x02019;s new round of health care reform is to reconstruct the health care system by emphasizing the role and function of primary health care. Since 2009, a large number of resources, including capital, human resources, and devices, have been invested in the primary care system, but the patient&#x02019;s utilization of primary care service is still much lower than what the policy-makers expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To break the deadlock, the government aims to refine a PHC system based on GPs&#x02019; qualified and cost-effective care supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The pilot reform of the GP contract policy (referred to as GPC) initiated in several large political and economic centers in China since 2011. The GPs were required to provide integrated medical services and health management to patients, including disease prevention, free physical examination to the elder aged 65 and above, diagnosis and treatment of common diseases, referral services, and home care service. However, imaging and tests were not included. The GPC model was funded by a combined source of the fixed public health fee per capita (invested by the local government), the extra compensation from the medical insurance, and the patients themselves. Usually, the three parties shared evenly to make the model financially motivated, with an estimated expenditure amount of CNY 120 (converted into $19.8 of 2014 USD). However, not every pilot took on the same compensation formula, nor this funding model is formalized or written into the main policy.</p><p id="Par15">Previous assessment for the pilot reform showed that the contracted GP services had a positive effect on hypertension and diabetes control and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, there were still many patients who did not have trust in GPC or doubted about the model, which resulted in low contract acceptance in some places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Guangdong is a vital reform forefront with the largest provincial population of 109,990,000 and high economy (GDP per capita of 73,290 RMB and $11,037.7 of 2016 USD) by the end of 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The government has increased financial investments and promoted GP training programs in recent years. Though these movements had brought a significant increase in qualified human resources, merely a small increase in patient&#x02019;s services utilization was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To break the deadlock, Guangdong chose to involve in the national pilot reform of GPC policy in 11 cities and rural towns in 2014. A contract between patients and GP was made with the aims of guiding patients to make use of essential medical and public health services provided by PHCs, among which the patients&#x02019; acceptance of primary GPC policy is particularly critical.</p><p id="Par17">This study is designed to explore the patients&#x02019; acceptance of GPC policy and its influencing factors.

visit frequency to PHCs was an influencing factor. Patients who made more use of health service in PHCs showed a stronger willingness to accept GPC policy. Since China&#x02019;s 2009 health care system reform, various primary care services have been provided in the public health package, such as free physical examination for patients aged 65&#x02009;years and above, medication consultation, and health education. Physical examination and medication consultation were most frequently used by the elderly. Therefore, patients aged 65 and above, and patients who visited PHCs more frequently were more inclined to accept GPC policy. This trend also meant that patients&#x02019; acceptance of GPC service was related to public health service provided by PHCs, which was also consistent with the policy priority setting to serve the aged people.</p><p id="Par31">It also found that patients&#x02019; assessment on PHCs was also associated with acceptance of GPC policy. When the participants were asked &#x0201c;why did not you sign a contract with GP,&#x0201d; the most frequent reason was &#x0201c;I am not satisfied with the PHCs.&#x0201d; By analysis patient satisfaction from eight dimensions, the results showed that the participants gave a good score on service attitude and medical ethics of doctors, but a poor rate on medical expenditure, the limited drugs in the drug list and medical equipment provided in PHCs. However, there were only two dimensions, including medical service coverage and satisfaction of the drug list, had a significant impact on acceptance. The previous research which used a EUROPEP scale showed that medical care and organization of care were two dimensions influencing patients&#x02019; acceptance of gatekeeper policy in Wuhan, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Despite differences in survey tools, the conclusion in the medical care coverage had similarity. There were also studies pointing out that patients had a poor assessment of drug list in PHCs in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, medical service coverage and drug list were of great importance in improving PHCs&#x02019; service and patients&#x02019; satisfaction.</p><p id="Par32">In the new round of Chinese medical system reform, a hierarchical health care system was put forward, and PHCs was designed as the patient&#x02019;s first contact with the whole system. However, the medical service coverage that could be offered in PHCs were limited at this stage. When the participants were asked, &#x0201c;What kind of medical service do you need most?&#x0201d; Medical consultation, follow-up of chronic diseases, and referral services were the top three answers. This finding was in accordance with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There are supposedly two ways to address this issue. First, to publicize the patients about the functions of PHCs, and offer them the most frequently needed medical services. Secondly, to provide a coordinated referral service to satisfy patients&#x02019; medical needs. When the patient&#x02019;s disease cannot be solved in the PHCs, they should be referred to the upper-level hospital conveniently.</p><p id="Par33">Drug list provided in PHCs is another factor influencing patients&#x02019; acceptance of GPC. The national system for essential drugs at the primary level was implemented since 2009. Only 307 kinds of drugs, including chemicals and herbal medicine, could be used in PHCs. When patients who were reluctant to accept the GPC were asked about that &#x0201c;What disappointed you most about PHCs?&#x0201d; the majority of them replied with &#x0201c;I cannot get all the medicine I need. And when medicines are prescribed in PHCs, I have to go to a tertiary hospital to get them.&#x0201d; Therefore, national essential drug list should be expanded, and measures such as increasing the use of non-essential drugs at the grassroots level should be taken. Some cities have conducted pilot reforms, but the effect needs further verification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">There are several limitations in this research. First, the potential influencing factors of patients&#x02019; acceptance of policy are possibly more than what we investigated in this research. Second, the investigation was conducted from the demand side. The data we collected were recalled by the respondents within 12&#x02009;months. Given the frequency of PHC use, we have to stay at this length of a period. Otherwise, there could be a higher probability of fewer differences among all the respondents. Therefore, recall bias could be a potential limitation that reduces the reliability in our analysis. There is no good way to solve this problem. Nevertheless, we tried to control the bias to our great ability. During the survey, we trained our investigator to improve their investigation skills, encouraging them to help respondents recalling by treasuring their patience. Furthermore, there are also studies indicated that some bias might not be as significant as we thought, because the missing information neglected by the respondents might not be so important as to recognize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In the following studies, we will also investigate other stakeholders, including the suppliers and regulators, to form a complete chain of evidence and promote the popularization of GP in Guangdong and other similar areas in China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">GPC policy is a significant reform to strengthen the utilization of primary health service and form a strong hierarchical medical delivery pattern. The patients&#x02019; acceptance is the key to this policy. Our study suggests that improvement of medical service accessibility such as follow-up of chronic diseases and referral service, as well as the expansion of drug list, will improve patients&#x02019; acceptance of GPC policy. This study also shows that patients who make more use of primary health service are inclined to accept the GPC service, so more attractive and high-quality services should be provided by PHCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
