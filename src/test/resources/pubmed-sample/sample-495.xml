Four treatments were as follows: no fertilization (CK), application of inorganic fertilizer (NPK), combined application of inorganic fertilizer with maize straw (NPK+S) and addition of biochar with inorganic fertilizer (NPK+B). Our results showed that after three consecutive years of application, the values of soil bulk density were significantly lower in both organic amendment-treated plots than in unamended (CK and NPK) plots. Compared with NPK, NPK+B more effectively increased the contents of soil organic carbon, improved the relative proportion of soil macro-aggregates and mean weight diameter, and enhanced field capacity as well as plant available water. Organic amendments had no obvious effect on soil C/N ratio or wilting coefficient. The results of linear regression indicated that the improvement in soil water retention could be attributed to the increases in soil organic carbon and aggregate stability.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest</institution></funding-source><award-id>201303095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhijie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>the National Scientific Foundation Project of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>41571290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Lili</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (201303095-9) and the National Scientific Foundation Project of China(41571290).

One of the world&#x02019;s greatest expanses of Mollisols is located in northeast China, and supports a major sector of grain production in China. Continuous and intensive cultivation and suboptimal agricultural practices have led to serious deterioration of soil quality. According to survey data [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], after 40 years of continuous cultivation, the content of soil organic matter and total nitrogen in the top 30 cm of a typical Mollisol decreased by 49.7% and 61.2% respectively; field capacity decreased from 57.7% to 41.9%, while bulk density increased from 0.79 g cm<sup>-3</sup> to 1.06 g cm<sup>-3</sup>.</p><p>Numerous studies have reported that organic amendments can increase soil fertility, ameliorate soil physical structure, enhance crop yields and improve soil resistance against erosion [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among organic amendments, biochar has unique properties such as high porosity, low density, high carbon content, and the ability to retain additional carbon [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many researchers have reached the consensus that biochar has the potential to improve soil properties and functions relevant to agronomic and environmental performance [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is generally agreed that the mechanism of yield increase is the improvement in nutrient and water retention following application of biochar [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, there are also studies that do not corroborate these findings. Major [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that addition of biochar produced from wood had no significant effect on either the water holding capacity or the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a clay soil. Similarly, Jeffery reported that soil water retention, aggregate stability, and field saturated hydraulic conductivity were not significantly affected by biochar amendment in a sandy soil [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Partly because of these discrepancies, the potential mechanisms behind changes in soil water retention characteristics after biochar application as an organic amendment still need to be further researched.</p><p>Studies on the effects of biochar application combined with fertilizer on nutrient and water retention in Mollisols and the associated mechanisms can contribute to improve soil fertility and sustainability of agroecosystems. We hypothesized that: (1) as an organic amendment, biochar has a positive influence on soil physical properties as well as nutrient and water retention; (2) these positive effects on nutrient and water retention are associated with increased soil aggregate stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Site description</title><p>The field experiment was conducted at the Black Soil Ecological Environment Key Field Research Station (42&#x000b0;57&#x02032; N, 148&#x000b0;57&#x02032; E), which is a long-term experiment established in 1979 and located in Gongzhuling, Jilin Province, China. is the site is supervised by the Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences who approved the present field research.

The main purpose was to compare the effects of fertilizer and fertilizer + organic amendments on fertility restoration in typical Mollisols. The study was set up in the field research station as a total of 16 micro-plots each with an area of 1.96 m<sup>2</sup> (1.4 m&#x000d7; 1.4 m). Each set of four micro-plots was arranged in a row and treated as a replication, and the interval between neighboring replications was 1 m. In order to minimize surface runoff and horizontal diffusion of water and fertilizers, soils in each micro-plot was separated from surrounding soil by a 10-cm wide &#x02018;brick wall&#x02019; with a 5-mm cement layer on each side from 50 cm below ground to 10 cm above ground. Fertilizer application rates were 135 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (applied as urea), 67.5 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> (applied as triple superphosphate), and 67.5 kg K<sub>2</sub>O ha<sup>-1</sup> (applied as potassium sulfate) for all the treatments except the control. Maize straw (containing 45% C) was incorporated into the topsoil at a rate equivalent to 11,100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for the NPK+S treatment, representing complete return to the field of all the maize straw generated under conventional management. Maize straw was removed from the field in the other treatments. To make the C input in the NPK+B treatment equal to that of the NPK+S treatment, 7,800 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of commercial biochar (produced from maize straw and peanut hulls) with 64% C content were added in the NPK+B treatment. All P and K fertilizers, maize straw, biochar and 60% of the total N fertilizer were applied a week before sowing, and the remaining 40% of the N fertilizer was applied in early July (60 days after planting). Two or three maize seeds (Xianyu 335) were hole-sown in the first week of May with a plant spacing of 25 cm and row spacing of 65 cm in each plot. At the three-leaf stage of maize the young plants were thinned out and one plant in each hole was left to make the plant density in the micro-plots equivalent to 61,500 plants ha<sup>-1</sup>. Harvest of maize was around October 1st throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Soil sampling</title><p>Soil samples were collected on Sep 29th 2014.

Chan (2007) found that even at a high application rate (100 t ha<sup>-1</sup>), biochar amendment alone did not increase radish dry matter yield [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, an increase of 95% in radish yield was observed when N fertilizer was applied in combination with biochar. Similarly, Jones (2012) reported an increase in yield when N fertilizer and biochar (100 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) were applied together [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These studies reflect the potential of biochar to increase the nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency of plants. In our study, applications of biochar and fertilizer contributed to a significant increase in soil organic carbon, but otherwise exhibited no substantial effects on soil total nitrogen and C:N ratio compared with the NPK treatment. This might be due to the lower application rate of biochar (7.8 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) in comparison with the aforementioned studies. Liu (2014) investigated the effects of different application rates of biochar (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) on rapeseed and sweet potato yields, aggregate stability, soil organic carbon, total N and C:N ratio. Their study demonstrated that significant increments in soil organic carbon and total N were only possible at the highest biochar application rate (40 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, although combined application of biochar plus NPK did not increase soil total N compared with that of NPK treatment, it did cause a more notable increase in soil organic carbon and decrease in soil bulk density; this role may be of greater value for fertility restoration of Mollisols.</p><p>There are contradictory conclusions regarding the impacts of biochar on soil aggregates. Liu (2012) conducted an incubation experiment to detect the effects of biochar on soil aggregates in four types of soils typical of the Loess Plateau in China [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They found that biochar application could increase the water-stable aggregate content of silt loam soils, but had no significant influence on aggregate formation and stability of sandy loam soils. Hardie (2014) reported that the application of 47 megagram ha<sup>-1</sup> of biochar made from the green waste of whole acacia trees had no significant effect on the stability of the 1&#x02013;2 mm aggregates in a planosol [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, the most dramatic effect of biochar was its role in increasing the proportion of macro-aggregates and therefore the mean weight diameter (MWD). Biochar influences soil aggregation due to interactions with soil organic matter, minerals and microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. High CEC made biochar more effective as a binding agent for organic matter and minerals to form macro-aggregates [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A significantly positive correlation between soil organic carbon and mean weight diameter of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154091.g001">Fig 1</xref>) suggests that the increase in SOC may contribute to aggregate stability, which is also reported by several other publications [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0154091.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0154091.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Linear regression between soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil mean weight diameter (MWD).</title><p>&#x0201c;r&#x0201d; indicates pearson correlation coefficient, and ** indicate significance at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0154091.g001"/></fig><p>The results of linear regression further revealed a significant positive correlation between plant available water and soil organic carbon, and between plant available water and mean weight diameter of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154091.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Verheijen (2010) suggested that water retention of soil is determined by the distribution and connectivity of pores in the soil medium, which is largely regulated by soil particle size (texture), combined with structural characteristics (aggregation) and SOM content [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The positive effect of biochar on soil physical properties and soil water retention was well documented. Abel (2013) studied the effects of biochar and hydrochar on physical properties and water retention characteristics of a sandy soil, and showed that application of biochar decreased bulk density, but increased total pore volume, water content at the permanent wilting point, as well as available water capacity [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Masulili (2010) showed that organic amendments, especially biochar, significantly increased total soil porosity and plant available water [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The authors attributed this to the formation of soil aggregates, which is confirmed by the present study. There have been contrasting conclusions about the effect of biochar on soil water retention [<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154091.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the effect of biochar application on soil water retention needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Three-year consecutive combined application of biochar and inorganic fertilizer significantly improved soil physical properties: bulk density decreased, while the relative proportion of soil macro-aggregates and mean weight diameter of aggregates increased. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and plant available water in biochar-treated plots were obviously higher than those in the non-fertilized treatment, which indicate that biochar, in combination with fertilizer, can effectively improve the ability of soil to retain nutrients and water. The significant relationships between soil organic carbon and available water, as well as between mean weight diameter of aggregates and available water, confirm the close connection between improvement of soil structure and its ability to supply water. Biochar is therefore an ideal amendment for improving certain key properties of degraded Mollisols, as it can provide tangible benefits in only several years and at a relatively modest rate of application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154091.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>The original data for generating <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154091.g001">Fig 1</xref> in the manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154091.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154091.s002"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>The original data for generating <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154091.g002">Fig 2</xref> in the manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154091.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154091.s003"><label>S3 Data</label><caption><title>The original data for generating <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154091.t001">Table 1</xref> in the manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154091.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154091.s004"><label>S4 Data</label><caption><title>The original data for generating <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154091.t002">Table 2</xref> in the manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154091.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154091.s005"><label>S5 Data</label><caption><title>The original data for generating <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154091.t003">Table 3</xref> in the manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154091.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0154091.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Weil</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name>, <source>The Nature and Properties of Soils</source>. <edition>13th ed.</edition>
