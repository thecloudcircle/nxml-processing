In this study, we define the specific mechanism of DV interaction with the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin, identify the downstream signal transduction pathway, and further investigate the functional significance of resultant VEGF release. Interestingly, we found that the LG3 portion of DV, which has been suggested to possess most of DV&#x02019;s angio-modulatory activity outside of the brain, binds poorly to &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and induces less BEC proliferation compared to full length DV. Additionally, we implicate DV&#x02019;s DGR sequence as an important element for the interaction of DV with &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>. Furthermore, we investigated the importance of AKT and ERK signaling in DV-induced VEGF expression and secretion. We show that DV increases the phosphorylation of ERK, which leads to subsequent activation and stabilization of eIF4E and HIF-1&#x003b1;. Inhibition of ERK activity by U0126 suppressed DV-induced expression and secretion of VEGR in BECs. While DV was capable of phosphorylating AKT we show that AKT phosphorylation does not play a role in DV&#x02019;s induction of VEGF expression or secretion using two separate inhibitors, LY294002 and Akt IV. Lastly, we demonstrate that VEGF activity is critical for DV increases in BEC proliferation, as well as angiogenesis in a BEC-neuronal co-culture system. Collectively, our findings expand our understanding of DV&#x02019;s mechanism of action on BECs, and further support its potential as a novel stroke therapy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01NS065842-01A01 to G.B. and 5R01AR049537-06 and 5R01AR048544 to AF.

A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain self-repair after stroke constitutes an essential research priority <xref rid="pone.0045257-Grotta1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and could lead to improving brain reparative processes. Following cerebral ischemia, there is rapid proteolysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as dramatic changes in the expression of ECM receptors, cell-bound integrins, in the infarct core and ischemic penumbra regions <xref rid="pone.0045257-delZoppo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045257-Milner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

Perlecan, an ECM heparan sulfate proteoglycan, contains 5 distinct protein domains (Domains I-V), each containing protein subunits with structural homology to other proteins <xref rid="pone.0045257-Bix2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Domain V (DV), the C-terminal fragment of perlecan, has anti-angiogenic activity outside of the brain following cleavage from perlecan, and therefore is also referred to as endorepellin <xref rid="pone.0045257-Mongiat1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045257-Bix3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. DV is an 82 kDa peptide composed of three laminin-like globular (LG1, 2, and 3) subunits, each separated by two epidermal growth factor (EGF, termed EGF1&#x02013;4 from N terminus to C terminus) subunits. Importantly, LG3, the 24 kDa C-terminal portion of DV, has been reported to be responsible for DV&#x02019;s anti-angiogenic activity <xref rid="pone.0045257-Bix4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Until recently, the only DV/LG3 receptor described in endothelial cells was the collagen receptor &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin <xref rid="pone.0045257-Woodall1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Interestingly, although equal or significantly lower nanomolar concentrations of LG3 (compared to DV) are required for &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin-mediated suppression of angiogenesis, LG3 binds to the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin (specifically, the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> ligand binding domain) with significantly lower affinity (K<italic><sub>d</sub></italic> of 1 &#x000b5;M) than does full length DV (K<italic><sub>d</sub></italic> of 80 nM), suggesting a much more complex relationship between DV, its LG3 component, the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin, and inhibition of angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0045257-Bix4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Indeed, a more complex relationship has been suggested whereby the LG1 and LG2 components of intact DV bind to VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 and the LG3 portion simultaneously binds to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> resulting in transcriptional repression of VEGF <xref rid="pone.0045257-Issbrucker1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>It has been shown that DV and LG3 are actively and persistently cleaved from full length perlecan after stroke <xref rid="pone.0045257-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045257-Saini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> by a number of proteases including BMP-1/Tolloid-like metalloproteases and cathepsin-L <xref rid="pone.0045257-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045257-Cailhier1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

This pro-angiogenic effect occurs in brain microvessels, where the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin is largely absent <xref rid="pone.0045257-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045257-McGeer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and is instead driven by VEGF released following direct interaction of DV with the fibronectin receptor &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin. However, the mechanisms by which DV interacts with &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and induces VEGF expression, as well as the potential of LG3 to bind &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and/or exert a pro-angiogenic effect in brain endothelial cells (BECs), remain unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to: 1) Further define the interaction of DV with the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin, 2) Evaluate LG3 binding to &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and determine whether it also exerts pro-angiogenic activity on BECs, 3) Identify the signaling pathways activated downstream of DV&#x02019;s interaction with the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin that results in VEGF release, and 4) Further demonstrate the functional significance of DV&#x02019;s induction of VEGF on BEC cell physiology.

Surprisingly, Akt inhibition alone significantly increased peIF4E levels under basal conditions to levels similar to DV treatment alone, suggesting a negative effect of Akt towards the signaling pathway driven by DV. Application of DV with Akt IV did not further increase peIF4E suggesting that DV activity or inhibition of Akt activity may be efficient enough to reach maximum levels of peIF4E levels.

Our work demonstrates that inhibition of Akt enhances rather than blocks DV&#x02019;s induction of VEGF, whereas inhibition of ERK completely abolishes DV&#x02019;s upregulation of VEGF at both the mRNA and protein levels. This suggests that the majority of DV induction of VEGF is through ERK dependent pathways subject to negative regulation control mediated through Akt. These opposing pathways may be partially reconciled by preliminary studies in our laboratory where we observed a significant increase in pAkt, peIF4E and HIF-1&#x003b1; levels under basal conditions in &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub> knockdown cells, whereas pERK was significantly decreased.

Until now, no studies have directly investigated the reason for such stabilization, although a recent study carried out by Ryu and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0045257-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> demonstrated the ability of HIF-1&#x003b1; to up-regulate fibronectin and its cognate receptor, &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin, suggesting a certain relationship between &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and HIF-1&#x003b1; that will be addressed in more detail in future studies.</p><p>This study further highlights the essential role of the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin for DV signal transduction, and DV&#x02019;s induction of VEGF in BECs. In addition to an increase of VEGF through an HIF-1&#x003b1; dependent mechanism, we observed c-Jun phosphorylation following DV exposure. This is in agreement with previous literature that demonstrated a direct correlation between increased c-Jun phosphorylation and VEGF expression <xref rid="pone.0045257-Textor1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

We primarily assessed the biological relevance of DV-induced VEGF secretion by investigating changes in endothelial cell proliferation and tube-like structure formation, two important cellular behaviors essential for angiogenesis. We demonstrated in a novel endothelial cell-neuron capillary morphogenesis assay that, consistent with our previous results <xref rid="pone.0045257-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, DV enhances BEC capillary morphogenesis in a VEGF dependent fashion, while inhibiting non-brain capillary morphogenesis as expected. While the possibility that DV influences BEC cell capillary morphogenesis via effects on the neurons present in the assay cannot be ruled out in this co-culture system, it is important to note that preliminary ELISA studies with DV treated neurons did not show increased levels of secreted pro-angiogenic factors including VEGF, BDNF, and NGF (data not shown) suggesting that DV-induced neuronal release of these factors is not a likely cause of DV-enhanced BEC capillary morphogenesis. Likewise, as neither VEGF or DV could induce capillary tube morphogenesis when the granule cells were removed in such a way that their secreted matrix and growth factors remained, the neurons themselves may provide a physical scaffold or platform for intercellular crosstalk for capillary formation under the appropriate circumstances (i.e. in the presence of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF or DV). Stated differently, DV, by increasing BEC production and release of VEGF, may foster direct and crosstalk interactions between BECs and neurons that leads to increased angiogenesis. However, it is also important to note that adding endothelial cells to neurons most likely results in changes to the extracellular matrix secreted by the neurons and/or the endothelial cells, which could then in turn contribute to DV&#x02019;s effects on endothelial cell capillary morphogenesis in the co-culture environment.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose the following context for DV action as a novel stroke treatment - Perlecan undergoes proteolysis following cerebral ischemia due to the cellular release of various proteases <xref rid="pone.0045257-Fukuda1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

In the current study, we expanded on previous findings by detailing how DV interacts with the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>integrin, which occurs at least in part, via DV&#x02019;s DGR amino acid sequence. Finally, we have identified the signaling cascade(s), involved with DV&#x02019;s induction of VEGF release and linked them with functional significance in brain endothelial cells shedding further light on DV's potential VEGF-mediated ischemic stroke therapeutic mechanism of action.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>N/A.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BECs) from C57Bl6 mice were kindly provided by Dr. Jane Welsh (Texas A&#x00026;M University) <xref rid="pone.0045257-Sapatino1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>
