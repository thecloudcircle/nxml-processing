The activity of Aurora B kinase is indispensable for TBA-induced mitotic arrest, and its inhibition causes mitotic slippage and postmitotic endoreduplication. However, the precise phenomenon underlying mitotic slippage, which is caused by treatment with both Aurora B inhibitors and TBAs, and the cell fate after postmitotic slippage are not completely understood. Here, we found that HeLa and breast cancer cells treated with the different types of TBAs, such as paclitaxel and eribulin (MT-stabilizing and MT-destabilizing agents, respectively), exhibited distinct behaviors of mitotic slippage on inhibition of Aurora B. In such conditions, the cell fates after postmitotic slippage vastly differed with respect to cell morphology, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity in short-term culture; that is, the effects of inhibition of Aurora B were beneficial for cytotoxicity enhancement in eribulin treatment but not in paclitaxel. However, in long-term culture, the cells that survived after mitotic slippage underwent endoreduplication and became giant cells in both cases, resulting in cellular senescence. We propose that MT-destabilizing agents may be more appropriate than MT-stabilizing agents for treating cancer cells with a weakened Aurora B kinase activity.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamic polymers that constantly switch between phases of growth and shrinkage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In mitotic cells, MTs constitute the spindle, and their plus-end dynamics is required for capture of kinetochores and equal segregation of sister chromatids, which are essential for proper mitotic progression. Disruption of spindle MTs does not satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which causes induction of mitotic arrest, thereby leading to cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Many chemical compounds can bind to MTs and induce SAC-dependent mitotic arrest; such tubulin-binding agents (TBAs) serve as important chemotherapeutic drugs against tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">TBAs are mainly classified into MT-stabilizing and MT-destabilizing agents. The former is exemplified by taxans and epothilones, and the latter, by vinca alkaloids, vinorelbine, and eribulin, which is a synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, is the newest anti-tumor drug for breast cancer by inhibiting MT polymerization irreversibly. Although both kinds of TBAs suppress MT dynamics and induce mitotic arrest identically, these agents affect MT dynamics in completely different ways. MT-stabilizing agents, such as taxans, directly bind along the interior surface of the MTs with high affinity, but bind poorly to soluble tubulin, resulting in inhibition of MT dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. MT-destabilizing agents, such as vinca alkaloids and eribulin, bind to the &#x003b2;-subunit of tubulin dimers at the MT plus-ends with high affinity, suppressing MT dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, eribulin binds to MT plus-ends with high affinity in a concentration-independent manner, whereas vinca alkaloids bind not only to MT plus-ends but also to tubulin located along the sides of MTs at a high concentration, suggesting that eribulin and vinca alkaloids inhibit microtubule dynamics via different mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Cancer cells treated with both kinds of TBAs exhibit distinct cell fates following prolonged exposure to MT-stabilizing (e.g., paclitaxel) or MT-destabilizing (e.g., nocodazole) agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. TBAs activate the SAC, leading to mitotic arrest; Aurora B kinase activity is required to maintain SAC signaling, as its inhibition prevents recruitment of all SAC components to kinetochores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Aurora B is a member of the Aurora kinase family, which comprises three family members, that is, Aurora A, B, and C. Aurora B is a component of chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which consists of kinase and three nonenzymatic subunits, that is, INCENP, survivin, and borealin, which regulate the localization, enzymatic activity, and stability, respectively, of Aurora B kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In early mitosis, many kinetochores engage in incorrect MT attachments. To ensure equal chromosome segregation, Aurora B kinase engages in kinetochore&#x02013;MT error correction, particularly in relation to destabilization of kinetochore&#x02013;MT interactions. Aurora B kinase activity is required to maintain the SAC induced by paclitaxel; inhibition of Aurora B rapidly overrides mitotic arrest (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;mitotic slippage&#x0201d;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Several studies have reported that mitotic slippage is caused by treatment with both paclitaxel (MT-stabilizing agent) and Aurora B inhibitors. However, the cell fate after postmitotic slippage is not completely clear. Furthermore, in the case of treatment with both eribulin (MT-destabilizing agent) and Aurora B inhibitors, the cell fate also remains poorly understood.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we investigated the contribution of Aurora B activity to maintaining the SAC induced by paclitaxel, an MT-stabilizing agent, or eribulin, an MT-destabilizing agent.

Importantly, in breast cancer, it has been reported that expression of Aurora B is heterogeneous and is not correlated with clinicopathological factors or prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A comparison of mitotic cell response, including mitotic slippage, and postmitotic cell fates following paclitaxel and eribulin treatment when Aurora B is inhibited may help to select drugs for the clinical treatment of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Paclitaxel and eribulin induced mitotic arrest and Aurora B activation</title><p id="Par6">To determine the effect of paclitaxel and eribulin on mitosis, we examined live-cell imaging in HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B (hereafter referred to as HeLa H2B-GFP cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Mitosis of HeLa cells was arrested on treatment with paclitaxel or eribulin, used at 100&#x02009;nM and 10&#x02009;nM, respectively, which are the minimum concentrations required for mitotic arrest (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and chromosome segregation was inhibited by suppression of MT dynamics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>).

Furthermore, the observed mitotic arrest involved simultaneous activating phosphorylation of Aurora B at Thr-232 and of Aurora A at Thr-288 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Effect of paclitaxel and eribulin on mitosis.

</p><p id="Par7">Paclitaxel and eribulin are currently used as clinically important chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Breast cancer is divided into several subtypes according to the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and HER2 status, which are indicators for therapeutic strategy. To examine whether paclitaxel and eribulin induce mitotic arrest in breast cancer cell lines, we selected typical subtypes of breast cancer cell lines, such as T47D (ER and PgR positive), SK-BR-3 (Her2 positive), and MDA-MB-231 (triple negative), and confirmed that both paclitaxel and eribulin induced mitotic arrest in all the breast cancer cell lines used, regardless of subtypes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that both paclitaxel and eribulin induced mitotic arrest and increased Aurora B activity in HeLa cells and among different subtypes of breast cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inhibition of Aurora B rapidly led to premature exit from mitotic arrest in paclitaxel-treated cells but this exit was not rapid in eribulin-treated cells</title><p id="Par8">Previous studies showed that inhibition of Aurora B rapidly overrides paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, the cell behavior on inhibition of Aurora B activity during eribulin-induced mitotic arrest is not known. We treated HeLa H2B-GFP cells with paclitaxel or eribulin and then added hesperadin, an Aurora B kinase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; then, we followed the cells over time by live cell imaging. Consistent with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we found that almost all of the paclitaxel-treated cells exited mitosis within 2&#x02009;h after addition of hesperadin. However, although eribulin-treated cells also exited mitosis after addition of hesperadin, they remained in mitosis longer than cells treated with paclitaxel and hesperadin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). Moreover, we measured the duration from hesperadin addition to chromosome decondensation. In contrast to the cells treated with paclitaxel and hesperadin, those treated with eribulin and hesperadin varied significantly in length and homogeneity of duration of mitotic arrest (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Furthermore, we monitored the cyclin B1 and MPM-2 levels by immunoblotting. After hesperadin addition, the cyclin B1 and MPM-2 levels decreased rapidly in paclitaxel-treated HeLa cells. In contrast, in eribulin-treated HeLa cells, the levels of these markers decreased more slowly than those in paclitaxel-treated cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). To confirm these observations, we further analyzed the effect of Aurora B inhibition during mitotic arrest induced with paclitaxel or eribulin by using barasertib, a highly selective Aurora B inhibitor. We first determined the optimal concentration of barasertib to specifically inhibit Aurora B. HeLa cells were treated with five concentrations of barasertib during mitotic arrest induced by nocodazole. The specificity of Aurora B inhibition was confirmed by the disappearance of Aurora B phosphorylated at Thr-232, but not of Aurora A phosphorylated at Thr-288. Consistent with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M barasertib specifically inhibited Aurora B (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A</xref>). There was a time-dependent decrease in mitotic rounding cells upon treatment with paclitaxel and barasertib, but not upon treatment with eribulin and barasertib (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2B and C</xref>). The levels of cyclin B1 and MPM-2 decreased rapidly in cells treated with paclitaxel and barasertib. By contrast, the levels of these mitotic markers were not obviously decreased in cells treated with eribulin and barasertib (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2D</xref>). Consistent with these observations obtained using Aurora B inhibitors, eribulin-treated cells remained in mitosis longer than paclitaxel-treated cells upon Aurora B knockdown via RNAi (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F&#x02013;H</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of Aurora B activity during mitotic arrest induced with paclitaxel or eribulin led to mitotic slippage and that the manner of slippage differed completely for both TBAs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect of inhibition of Aurora B during paclitaxel- or eribulin-induced mitotic arrest.

Therefore, we further examined the effect of inhibition of Aurora B during mitotic arrest induced with paclitaxel or eribulin among different subtypes of breast cancer cell lines. We used ZM447439 or hesperadin as an Aurora B inhibitor. Cells were treated with 100&#x02009;nM paclitaxel or 10&#x02009;nM eribulin, except for MDA-MB-231 cells, which were treated with 100&#x02009;nM eribulin, all of which are minimum concentrations required for mitosis arrest of breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Asynchronous T47D cells were cultured in media supplemented with paclitaxel or eribulin and Aurora B inhibitors, resulting in decrease in MPM-2 and cyclin B1 levels. Furthermore, MPM-2 and cyclin B1 levels on treatment with paclitaxel and Aurora B inhibitors were remarkably lower than those with eribulin and Aurora B inhibitors (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A</xref>). Consistent with this result, the mitotic index of paclitaxel and Aurora B inhibitors greatly decreased by approximately one-sixth.

Consistent with these studies, the colony-forming efficiency greatly decreased after 72-h incubation with paclitaxel alone, whereas the efficiency with eribulin alone partially decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). Here, we found that the colony-forming efficiency in cells treated with paclitaxel and hesperidin was markedly higher than that for paclitaxel alone. In contrast, treatment with eribulin-hesperadin was more sensitive to the colony formation than that of eribulin alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). Therefore, we attributed this difference to the induction level of apoptosis and measured active caspase and cleaved PARP levels to evaluate the induction of apoptosis. Both caspase-9 and cleaved PARP levels were higher in cells treated with paclitaxel alone than in those treated with paclitaxel and hesperidin. However, we observed an inverse tendency in cells treated with eribulin, that is, apoptosis levels in cells treated with eribulin and hesperidin were higher than those with eribulin alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cellular senescence in postmitotic slippage.

Thus, we conclude that the cytostatic effect of eribulin is more effective in combination with an Aurora B inhibitor, but that of paclitaxel is adversely affected by combination with an Aurora B inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Mitotic slippage&#x02013;induced endoreduplication triggered cellular senescence</title><p id="Par14">Previous studies showed that chemotherapeutic agents could induce senescence in tumor cells, especially in the antiapoptotic context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

As our data showed that treatment with an Aurora B inhibitor induced mitotic slippage from both paclitaxel-induced and eribulin-induced mitotic arrest, resulting in postmitotic endoreduplication, we speculated that the cells in such a context might cause cellular senescence after long-term culture. To investigate this possibility, we measured SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity, a hallmark of cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Cells surviving for 5&#x02013;7 days after treatment with paclitaxel and hesperadin or with eribulin and hesperadin showed an enlarged cellular morphology with increased SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>).

Although wild-type endogenous p53 is suppressed by human papillomavirus (HPV)&#x02013;generated E6 activity in HeLa cells, it has been shown that p53 can escape from its E6-mediated downregulation after chemotherapy with drugs such as cisplatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Consistent with these observations, the p53&#x02013;p21 pathway was found to be remarkably upregulated after long-term culture (days 7&#x02013;9) not only in medium containing compounds (paclitaxel and hesperadin or eribulin and hesperadin) but also compound-free medium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>).

TBAs disrupt the dynamics of spindle MTs and activate the SAC, which causes induction of mitotic arrest, resulting in cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, mitotic cell death is not always induced in TBA-treated cells; previous studies demonstrated that TBA-induced cell death occurs not only during mitosis but also during interphase following mitotic slippage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, such TBA-induced mitotic arrest is maintained by Aurora B kinase in an activity-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Here, we found that Aurora B contributed to different extents to paclitaxel- and eribulin-induced mitotic arrest. We also focused on the distinct cell fates after postmitotic slippage induced by inhibition of Aurora B in the case of paclitaxel- and eribulin-induced mitotic arrest.</p><p id="Par16">Aurora B plays multiple roles during cell division, including the processes of spindle assembly, kinetochore&#x02013;MT interactions, and cytokinesis, and is believed to be involved in the maintenance of SAC signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous studies, our data showed that inhibition of Aurora B during mitotic arrest induced with TBAs led to mitotic slippage. In addition, our data showed differing contributions of Aurora B to maintaining SAC induced-mitotic arrest in treatment with paclitaxel or eribulin. In previous studies, during nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest, Aurora B was found to be required for maintenance of SAC signaling, especially in retention of kinetochore localization of the checkpoint kinases BubR1 and Bub1, whereas Mad2 still localized at kinetochores after inhibition of Aurora B by hesperadin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the case of paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest, cells with inhibition of Aurora B show marked decrease not only in BubR1- and Bub1- but also in Mad2-positive kinetochores, resulting in accelerated SAC satisfaction and mitotic slippage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Taken together with our result showing that cells treated with eribulin and hesperadin remained in mitosis substantially longer than cells treated with paclitaxel and hesperadin, this indicates that the levels of Mad2 localization at kinetochores might be sufficient to sustain eribulin-induced mitotic arrest for some time after inhibition of Aurora B by hesperadin.</p><p id="Par17">Aurora A is another member of the Aurora kinase family. TBA treatment induced not only activating phosphorylation of Aurora B at Thr-232, but also of Aurora A at Thr-288 during mitosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). A previous report showed that inhibition of Aurora A using the specific inhibitor MLN8054 or depletion of Aurora A via RNAi induces slippage from mitotic arrest induced by paclitaxel. In these conditions, Aurora B activity does not seem to be abrogated because the number of cells expressing histone H3 phosphorylated at Ser10 is not markedly decreased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in this study, specific inhibition of Aurora B using barasertib did not prevent the activating phosphorylation of Aurora A at Thr-288 during slippage from mitotic arrest induced by paclitaxel. Hence, inhibition of Aurora A and Aurora B may induce slippage from paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest via different mechanisms.</p><p id="Par18">The cell fates following mitotic slippage distinctly differ between the types of slippage. In the case of paclitaxel, inhibition of Aurora B by hesperadin appears to play a direct role in preventing sensitivity to paclitaxel. One possible explanation is that inhibition of Aurora B rapidly leads to mitotic slippage in paclitaxel-treated cells; therefore, apoptotic signals do not reach the threshold required for cell death, resulting in survival after tetraploidy generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, cells treated with paclitaxel alone exit after prolonged mitotic arrest, and then die in the following interphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A previous study demonstrated that the main subpopulation of HeLa cells treated with nocodazole alone was arrested in mitosis and also exited mitosis but subsequently underwent endoreduplication, entering the next mitosis cycle without ever undergoing division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Here, eribulin-treated cells might behave similar to nocodazole-treated cells. Importantly, in the case of eribulin, inhibition of Aurora B by hesperadin appeared to lead to enhanced sensitivity to eribulin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B&#x02013;D,F</xref>). In our study, the duration of mitosis for cells treated with eribulin alone was longer than that for cells treated with eribulin and hesperadin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>); thus, the cytotoxicity of eribulin might not simply be associated with the duration of sustained mitosis. The contribution of SAC proteins, including Aurora B, to paclitaxel sensitivity has been previously reported in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric, ovarian, and breast cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, reduced expression of SAC components has been observed in several kinds of cancer cells, resulting in impaired ability to sustain SAC signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Taken together with our results showing that inhibition of Aurora B leads to enhanced sensitivity to eribulin, this indicates that MT-destabilizing agents, such as vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, and eribulin, may be more appropriate than MT-stabilizing agents, such as taxans and epothilones, for treating cancer cells with a weakened SAC. The difference between the roles played by inhibition of Aurora B in paclitaxel- and eribulin-treated cells is not yet clear. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of inhibition of Aurora B in paclitaxel- and eribulin-treated cells will be required for understanding the effect of MT-stabilizing and MT-destabilizing agents&#x02013;induced mitotic slippage on postmitotic cell fates.</p><p id="Par19">Consistent with previous studies on therapy-induced senescence (TIS), including the inhibition of Aurora B, cellular senescence-like phenotypes were observed in HeLa cells with endoreduplication induced on treatment with paclitaxel and hesperadin and on treatment with eribulin and hesperadin. Although the causes and phenotypes of polyploid cells differed between these two types of treatments in the short term, the fate of cells, which underwent substantial endoreduplication and became highly polyploid, were similar under both conditions. Furthermore, in light of recent studies showing that various agents can induce cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, it is suggested that the inhibition of Aurora B or other SAC components when tumor cells exhibit aberrant mitosis on treatment with TBAs can aid in tumor suppression in the form of a trigger for cellular senescence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cell culture, RNAi, and reagents</title><p id="Par20">HeLa (obtained from JCRB Cell Bank) and MDA-MB-231 (obtained from ATCC) cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM, Gibco).
