In complex plant genomes, such as maize, it has been proposed that loops span heterochromatic regions marked by higher repeat content, but little is known on their spatial organization and genome-wide occurrence in relation to transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Here, ultra-deep Hi-C sequencing of maize B73 leaf tissue was combined with gene expression and open chromatin sequencing for chromatin loop discovery and correlation with hierarchical topologically-associating domains (TADs) and transcriptional activity. A majority of all anchors are shared between multiple loops from previous public maize high-resolution interactome datasets, suggesting a highly dynamic environment, with a conserved set of anchors involved in multiple interaction networks. Chromatin loop interiors are marked by higher repeat contents than the anchors flanking them. A small fraction of high-resolution interaction anchors, fully embedded in larger chromatin loops, co-locate with active genes and putative protein-binding sites. Combinatorial analyses indicate that all anchors studied here co-locate with at least 81.5% of expressed genes and 74% of open chromatin regions. Approximately 38% of all Hi-C chromatin loops are fully embedded within hierarchical TAD-like domains, while the remaining ones share anchors with domain boundaries or with distinct domains. Those various loop types exhibit specific patterns of overlap for open chromatin regions and expressed genes, but no apparent pattern of gene expression. In addition, up to 63% of all unique variants derived from a prior public maize eQTL dataset overlap with Hi-C loop anchors. Anchor annotation suggests that &#x0003c;&#x02009;7% of all loops detected here are potentially devoid of any genes or regulatory elements. The overall organization of chromatin loop anchors in the maize genome suggest a loop modeling system hypothesized to resemble phase separation of repeat-rich regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Sets of conserved chromatin loop anchors mapping to hierarchical domains contains core structural components of the gene expression machinery in maize.

Recent improvements in the molecular characterization of chromatin have shown that its spatial structure can be dissected into separate functional domains, ranging in sizes from a few Kbps to Mbps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Those domains include A and B compartments, known to be associated with the euchromatic and heterochromatic portions of a genome, respectively. Other domains, known as Topologically-Associating Domains (&#x0201c;TADs&#x0201d;) have now been discovered in multiple organisms, including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other features, known as &#x0201c;chromatin loops&#x0201d;, are thought to be critical factors for the spatial regulation of gene expression through a loop extrusion mechanism allowing the three-dimensional positioning of distal regulatory elements, and their interaction with proximal elements regulating the expression of specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">In plants, the understanding of chromatin organization is mainly derived from a relatively small number of studies in species that include Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Large plant genomes can be partitioned into TAD-like domains, which are in fact compartment domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some domains are enriched in active genes, open chromatin and active histone marks while others are enriched in epigenetics signatures typical of repressive domains (including DNA methylation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In maize, chromatin loops can be formed between active chromatin domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], forming a rich and complex molecular interaction network linking distal and proximal regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], suggesting that the presence of chromatin loops in repeat-rich plant genomes could be a mechanism allowing distal regulatory elements to activate, or repress, genes separated from those elements by condensed heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Specific variants in regulatory elements also may contribute to variations in gene expression through long-range chromatin interactions, linking eQTLs to their associated genes via chromatin loop interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">While long-range loop formation between chromatin domains has been shown to link together gene-rich and distal regulatory regions in complex plant genomes, no study yet has been performed to determine the extent of such mechanism and its genome-wide correlation to TAD-like domains and gene transcription in maize. In addition, while Hi-C is known as a &#x0201c;low-resolution&#x0201d; method capturing mainly long-range chromatin loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], its relationship to higher resolution loops detected with methods such as Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (&#x0201c;ChIA-PET&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or HiChIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] still remains to be determined, along with the predisposition of expressed genes and regulatory elements to co-locate with specific loop types. In this study, the overall structure of chromatin loops in maize and their prevalence as a putative mode of action associated with the regulation of gene transcription were evaluated. Structural relationships between TAD-like domains, chromatin loops, gene expression and open chromatin regions (used as indirect signals for protein binding to DNA) were systematically assessed through ultra-deep sequencing of Hi-C libraries, combined with the generation of RNA-Seq and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (&#x0201c;ATAC-Seq&#x0201d;) datasets from the same maize tissue, and further compared to public maize high-resolution interactome and eQTL functional datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Results showed substantial overlaps between those features, revealing chromatin loops as biological components of the gene regulation machinery in maize, with a restricted number of chromatin loop anchors as its core structural unit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">Whole maize B73 leaf tissue was collected at development stage v04. The same batch of plants, at the same stage (v04) and divided into four biological replicates (four plants per replicate) was used for gene expression profiling (RNA-Seq; four replicates), three-dimensional chromatin profiling (Hi-C; two replicates) and accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq; three replicates).</p><p id="Par8">The ultra-deep sequencing of two Hi-C biological replicates led to a total number of 3,435,596,872 and 3,424,795,714 raw paired reads, for replicates 1 and 2, respectively. Filtering of the raw data and mapping to the B73 AGPv4 reference genome sequence led to the detection of 392,396,275 and 449,828,472 Hi-C contact pairs, after combining inter-chromosomal and intra-chromosomal contacts for replicates 1 and 2, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Further analysis showed evidence of hierarchical TAD-like domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], covering most of the maize genome in a nested fashion (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).

Previous studies have shown that the rice genome contained extensive hierarchical chromatin interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Others have shown that TAD-like domains in larger plant genomes such as maize are essentially compartment domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], where transcriptionally active domains are separated by large inactive heterochromatic domains. The results shown here suggest a model where &#x0201c;level 0&#x0201d; TAD-like compartment domains may contain multiple nested layers of chromatin interactions, marked by the presence of smaller nested &#x0201c;sub-domains&#x0201d;.

The new matrices then were used to compute new domains for each Hi-C replicate, which were subsequently compared to the ones computed with full read counts (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). While the total number of domains did not significantly improve with higher initial read counts, it led nonetheless to the dissection of some domains into additional sub-domains.</p><p id="Par11">In addition to TAD-like domains, the chromosomes could be partitioned into larger chromosomal A/B compartments by eigenvector analysis of the Hi-C interaction matrices. In maize, those compartments would divide each chromosome into two global A compartments at the chromosomal ends, flanking a global B compartment, corresponding roughly to its pericentromeric heterochromatic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Eigenvector analysis of chromosome 1 at 500Kb resolution, using Hi-C interaction matrices generated from the &#x0201c;50% read count&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;100% read count&#x0201d; datasets shown above, led to the detection of global compartments similar in structure to what had been already published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and between each other, therefore indicating that, contrary to domain detection, increasing read counts did not significantly improve compartment detection.</p><p id="Par12">Compartments, domains and sub-domains are prominent organizational features in the maize genome. Increased interactions at their borders suggested the existence of chromatin loops (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). A total of 17,176 and 25,917 chromatin loops were initially detected for Hi-C replicates 1 (See Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and 2 (See Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), respectively. To confirm their validity, HICCUPS analyses were run at various resolutions from interaction matrices generated with distinct read counts (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Expectedly, loop counts varied with both read counts and resolution of detection. Based on those results, it was determined that the initial datasets for both replicates provided an appropriate number of high-resolution loops for subsequent analysis.

There were 7917 loops present in both replicates, with both anchors overlapping by at least 1&#x02009;bp, and only 1268 loops in replicate 1 and 2657 loops in replicate 2 where none of the anchor overlap, indicating that a significant fraction of the loops from both replicates shared one anchor only.</p><p id="Par14">Additional comparisons were made with prior sets of high-resolution chromatin interactions detected with the HiChIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and ChIA-PET methodologies in B73 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The HiChIP data were generated using antibodies targeting histone modifications associated with transcriptional activations (H3K4me3) and repression (H3K27me3) while the ChIA-PET data were generated using antibodies targeting histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation only (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) and filtered into a final chromatin interaction dataset (see Supplementary Data&#x000a0;16 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Those high-resolution datasets were expected to capture local interactions (such as interactions between regulatory elements), typically not detectable via Hi-C sequencing.

For each replicate, peaks were classified as located between two nucleosomes (&#x0201c;nucleosome-free&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;NF&#x0201d;) or overlapping one or more nucleosome (&#x0201c;multi-nucleosome&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;MN&#x0201d;), based on the distance between ATAC-Seq paired sequencing reads. While NF peaks tended to be discrete peaks (~&#x02009;100&#x02009;bps) located immediately upstream or downstream of genes (proximal peaks), or in intergenic regions (distal peaks), MN peaks tended to be broad peaks primarily centered over entire gene regions. A list of 32,009 &#x0201c;consensus&#x0201d; NF and MN peaks was generated, where a peak had to be present in at least two individual replicates to be conserved, out of which only the 19,532 NF peaks were kept for further analysis (See Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Co-location analysis of ATAC-Seq NF peaks with chromatin loops initially was performed using whole replicate 1 and 2 Hi-C loop datasets and assessed, based on the following criteria. As many chromatin loop anchors were shared between multiple loops, in a significant number of cases, a peak could align to an anchor for one loop and a loop interior for another loop. Therefore, peak overlaps to loop regions were determined first based on their potential overlap to at least one loop anchor. If no overlap was detected, peaks were assessed based on their potential overlaps to loop interiors, then to genomic regions located outside of chromatin loops. Using this approach, up to 13,026 peaks, out of 19,532, overlapped primarily with anchors, while up to 4649 peaks overlapped primarily with loop interiors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).

In this analysis, anchors were annotated based on the activity of overlapping genes located next to NF peaks. The data show that 62% of all NF peaks overlapping with chromatin loop anchors either overlapped or were located &#x0003c;2Kbps away from expressed genes, suggesting those peaks may correspond to proximal regulatory regions, including promoters. Conversely, analysis of gene activity in loop anchors (including genes present in multiple anchors) showed that, for 71% of anchors harboring genes, at least one of those genes was expressed (See Additional File <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Expression was associated with the absence of inactive genes within the anchor for 88% of those anchors, and this trend was generally accentuated by the presence of proximal open chromatin peaks. 74% of the remaining anchors carried distal peaks, possibly representing long-range regulatory elements.</p><p id="Par26">Anchor annotation using replicate 1 as an example (See Additional File <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>) showed that, of all 18,296 anchors with at least one expressed gene, 15,058, or 82%, had only one expressed gene. A total of 3684 anchors contained at least one peak and no expressed genes (including 2285 containing one peak only). Out of those, 2897 were part of a loop where the opposite anchor contained at least one expressed gene and at least one peak, suggesting functional interactions between proximal and distal elements facilitated by loop formation. In addition, there were a total of 5488 loops containing at least one expressed gene in both anchors, including 1058 harboring at least one peak in each anchor, indicating potential interactions between proximal elements. Interestingly, out of the 11,066 anchors from replicate 1 with no known peak or expressed gene, only 2368 were combined together into one chromatin loop, suggesting that only 6.8% (1184/17,176) of all long-range chromatin loops from replicate 1 are potentially devoid of detected gene expression activity or open chromatin regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">A majority of expressed genes in leaf tissue and discrete open chromatin regions (located primarily at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of genes, as well as other intergenic regions that may correspond to proximal and distal regulatory element binding sites) co-locate with a conserved set of chromatin loop anchors. Chromatin loops co-locate with hierarchical TAD-like domains and sub-domains, where chromatin interactions may occur in a series of nested hierarchical sub-domains contained within larger compartment domains. Based on their co-location, loops can be divided into specific categories, each reflecting apparent variable overlap frequencies with open chromatin regions, expressed genes and public eQTL associated traits. This suggests the possibility of distinct loop types, and, possibly, distinct molecular functions, although no apparent differences in gene expression was observed between genes mapping to various loop types and regions. A vast majority of the chromatin loops detected via Hi-C share anchors with other loops, including high-resolution interactions detected in the same genotype (B73), but with more accurate techniques (HiChIP and ChIA-PET). A subset of these anchors overlaps with one or more expressed genes and open chromatin regions. Many are shared between multiple loops, including some that are fully embedded within larger ones. Taken together, these data indicate that loop formation may be linked to gene transcription and regulation through highly dynamic three-dimensional mechanisms reminiscent of enhancer/promoter interaction complexes described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and involving a conserved set of genomic regions.</p><p id="Par28">Interestingly, while most of the detected active genes and open chromatin regions co-locate with chromatin loop anchors, a large portion of anchors, conversely, do not overlap with any genes or ATAC-seq peaks. It is likely that, due to technical constraints, the 19,532 consensus NF peaks used here represent a conservative estimate of the total peak counts. Therefore, many of the &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; loop anchors listed here may harbor putative open chromatin regions that were undetected in the present study.</p><p id="Par29">When combined with the observation that repeat content is denser in loop interiors than in the flanking loop anchors, the results shown here are in line with a phase separation model of chromatin dynamics in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this model, chromatin compartmentalization in transcribed regions is marked by the exclusion of adjacent repeat-rich regions and the formation of supramolecular condensates driving the regulation of gene expression through the active interactions between molecules that include proteins and nucleic acids. Such interaction potentially could be marked by the presence of ATAC-Seq peaks in loop anchors. Some of the loops analyzed here exhibit multiple peaks in their anchors (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>), suggesting the possibility of multi-protein assemblies in the vicinity of potential DNA binding sites. As the work done here was performed on whole tissue, it is possible that some of the signals observed are actually due to specific cell types. As a result, more cell type-specific studies will be required to assess the mechanistic aspects of tri-dimensional regulation of gene transcription in maize. Of interest will be the need to determine whether loop formation facilitates gene expression or instead derives from it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">The results shown here indicate that the scope of the functional maize genome may be narrowed down to a restricted number of loop anchors. Data suggest that these regions anchor regulatory complexes interacting with a majority of those genes being expressed in maize, through three-dimensional interactions hypothesized to be consistent with a phase separation model of chromatin dynamics. While further investigation will be required to confirm this model, the various sequencing datasets generated for this study will facilitate the systematic discovery of new motifs, such as enhancers and eQTL variants, making them prime candidates for future functional genomics studies through their direct association with the transcription of specific gene sets. In addition, the current datasets may be used to facilitate prediction modeling for breeding and genomic selection applications, through the ranking of specific variants in loop anchors and of their predicted functional impact in genotypes of interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par31">Whole maize B73 v04 leaf tissue, grown in a greenhouse, was collected and stored at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C after grinding.

Coordinates of the eQTLs and the SNPs were translated to coordinates in Zm-B73-REFERENCE-GRAMENE-4.0 (AGPv4) using the EnsemblPlants Assembly Converter. Gene names were translated to the B73 v4 Zm00001d.2 gene model set names using cross-reference information provided by MaizeGDB. A number of eQTLs could not be translated directly, as, for example, when the associated gene in RefGen v2 no longer existed in AGPv4 or the converter split it into several segments. In the former case the original record was ignored; in the latter, the segment containing the SNP was retained as the AGPv4 eQTL. Each AGPv4 eQTL record (eQTL region, lead SNP, associated gene) then was examined in conjunction with loop structures and coordinates predicted from replicate 2.</p><p id="Par38">Gramene gene models for build 4.0 of B73 were obtained from the MaizeGDB repository, specifically from the GFF3 file Zm-B73-REFERENCE-GRAMENE-4.0_Zm00001d.2.gff3. Feature types &#x0201c;gene,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;lincRNA_gene,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;miRNA_gene,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;tRNA_gene&#x0201d; were selected, yielding 44,474 genes. Of these, 38,847 were reported to be associated with chromosomes 1&#x02013;10 and represent the set used for genic analyses.</p><p id="Par39">RNA-Seq libraries derived from all four biological replicates were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system at 1x50bps (single 3&#x02032; end sequenced), targeting ~20MM single reads per replicate. Read sequences were trimmed based on quality scores and those matching B73 mitochondrial, chloroplast, and rRNA sequences were filtered with FACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The remaining reads were quantified using Kallisto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] pseudoalignment to the B73 AGPv4 gene transcripts and estimated counts summarized at the gene level. The Sleuth expression analysis suite in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was used to normalize and report the abundances as Transcripts Per Million, or TPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Individual expression levels (TPM counts) reported for each gene in the four biological replicates were averaged to provide a global average expression level for each gene. Genes with average leaf expression level greater than or equal to one were taken as expressing. With this criterion, 18,700 genes associated with chromosomes 1&#x02013;10 were listed as &#x0201c;expressed genes&#x0201d; while the remaining 20,147 were listed as &#x0201c;unexpressed&#x0201d;. Finally, genes were mapped to Hi-C chromatin loops using BEDTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Sequencing of three ATAC-Seq biological replicates was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system at 2x50bps. After removing contaminant adapter and organellar sequences, reads were mapped to the AGPv4 reference genome. After filtering for proper read pair alignments and removing duplicated reads, resulting BAM files were separated based on the distance between read pairs into &#x0201c;NF&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;nucleosome-free&#x0201d;) regions and &#x0201c;MN&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;multi-nucleosome&#x0201d;) regions. Reads mapping to specific regions known to exhibit high coverage depth (for example, homologs to organellar genes) were removed using &#x0201c;bedtools -intersect&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. NF and MN peaks were called separately with the MACS2 software tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Consensus peaks were generated by searching for physical overlap (&#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x02009;bp) between peaks generated for each replicate.</p><p id="Par41">ATAC-Seq NF consensus peaks were classified in relation to their proximity to a particular expressing gene. The location of each expressing gene was compared to the set of 19,532 NF consensus peaks on chromosomes 1&#x02013;10. For each, the closest peak and its distance in bp was determined using &#x0201c;bedtools -closest&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], comparing the genomic coordinates (start-end) of the gene with the genomic coordinates (start-end) of each peak. Genomic coordinates and strand information for genes were taken from the Gramene gene models GFF3 file. The nearest peak was declared &#x0201c;overlapping&#x0201d; if any part of its span overlapped (at least 1&#x02009;bp) any part of the gene&#x02019;s span, in which case &#x0201c;bedtools -closest&#x0201d; reported a genomic distance of 0&#x02009;bp. Otherwise, a signed distance was reported, negative if the peak was located &#x0201c;left&#x0201d; of the gene, positive when it was located &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; of it. The distance indicated the smallest absolute difference between the endpoints of the gene and the peak. This signed distance and the known strand of the gene allowed determination of the peak as lying 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; of the gene. Peaks then were mapped to gene models using BEDTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] according to the following four categories: 1) peaks overlapping a particular gene model; 2) peaks located &#x0003c;2Kbps downstream from a gene model; 3) peaks located &#x0003c;2Kbps upstream from a gene model; and 4) peaks located &#x0003e;2Kbps away from a gene model (upstream or downstream).</p><p id="Par42">Peaks were mapped to chromatin loops using BEDTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Prioritization of peak overlaps was made necessary by the fact that a large fraction of chromatin loops shared one anchor. It was performed according to the following order: 1) peaks overlapping an anchor region; 2) peaks overlapping a loop interior region; 3) peaks not overlapping any loop regions. Following that order, peaks mapping to category 1 were removed from the list of peaks mapped to category 2 (and from category 3 when mapping to category 2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
