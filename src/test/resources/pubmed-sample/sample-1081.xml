This particular timespan is undetermined for the etiological agent of flea-borne spotted fever (<italic>Rickettsia felis</italic>). Artificial acquisition of <italic>R. felis</italic> by blood-feeding cat fleas revealed dissemination to the salivary glands after seven&#x000a0;days; however, this length of time is inconsistent with co-feeding studies that produced infectious cat fleas within 24&#x000a0;h of infection.

In addition to the high proportion of <italic>R. felis</italic> infections in humans from a malaria-endemic region, the presence of this pathogen has been detected in other vertebrate hosts (including cats, dogs, opossums, raccoons, rodents and monkeys) and is present on every continent except Antarctica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>R. felis</italic> has been identified in other hematophagous arthropods (including more than 40 additional species of fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, and mites) throughout the world (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]); nonetheless, the cosmopolitan cat flea is implicated as the primary biological vector based on field and laboratory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although maintenance of <italic>R. felis</italic> in nature is poorly understood, both experimental and computational transmission models indicate that this bacterium could circulate in enzootic cycles through infectious co-feeding (i.e. pathogen transmission occurs between actively blood-feeding arthropods in the absence of a disseminated vertebrate infection) by cat fleas on vertebrate hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As such, there is a low occurrence of <italic>R. felis</italic> infections in the blood of vertebrate hosts and high occurrence of <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected arthropods in field surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Additionally, experimental demonstration of interspecific transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> on a vertebrate host between cat fleas and Oriental rat fleas (<italic>Xenopsylla cheopis</italic>) highlights the potential for co-feeding transmission to explain the presence of <italic>R. felis</italic> in a variety of blood-feeding vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Currently, the role of the vertebrate host in the transmission biology of <italic>R. felis</italic>, beyond providing a substrate for pathogen transfer between co-feeding arthropods, is unclear and requires further investigation.</p><p>Transmission of flea-borne bacterial pathogens is multifaceted and often each species has several transmission routes to ensure maintenance within the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For example, agents of cat scratch disease (<italic>Bartonella henselae</italic>) and murine typhus (<italic>Rickettsia typhi</italic>) utilize horizontal transmission via contaminated flea feces deposited on the host as the primary source of infection to vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additional horizontal transmission occurs for these pathogens via regurgitation of bacteria from the flea&#x02019;s midgut into the bite site, but requires a lengthy incubation period and occurs to a lesser extent compared to fecal transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Contrary to other flea-borne bacterial agents but similar to tick-borne rickettsial pathogens, horizontal transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> can occur by infectious saliva at the bite site. Support for this saliva transmission mechanism includes identification of <italic>R. felis</italic> in the salivary glands of infected cat fleas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and amplification of rickettsial DNA in the blood, as well as seroconversion, of vertebrate hosts exposed to feeding cat fleas with <italic>R. felis</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further evidence for transmission through infectious saliva is the transfer of bacteria between cat fleas co-feeding on a shared bloodmeal, which has been demonstrated in an artificial host system and on a vertebrate host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Based on the hydrodynamic force in the food canal of cat fleas (i.e. backwards, away from the bite site, whereas saliva flows forward into the bite site) and the rapid turnover of cat flea midgut contents (i.e. clearance of excessive bacteria), regurgitation of blood containing bacteria from cat fleas seems to be an unlikely scenario for transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; however, no direct evidence for or against this mechanism has been demonstrated.</p><p>The journey of an infectious agent within a vector from ingestion to subsequent transmission to a new host (i.e. extrinsic incubation period or EIP) relies on a series of complex vector-pathogen interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Recently, the infection kinetics of bloodmeal-acquired <italic>R. felis</italic> in cat fleas was observed by immunofluorescence assays (IFA) at weekly intervals for 28&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This study revealed that in previously uninfected cat fleas the dissemination of <italic>R. felis</italic> from midgut to salivary glands requires seven or more days post-exposure (dpe) to an <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected bloodmeal. Based on these data, the probable EIP needed for horizontal transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by infectious cat flea saliva is approximately seven&#x000a0;days. However, co-feeding transmission bioassays demonstrated that cat fleas exposed to an <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected bloodmeal are infectious to na&#x000ef;ve fleas after 24&#x000a0;h (in both an artificial host system and on vertebrate hosts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, the EIP of <italic>R. felis</italic> within the biological vector remains unknown, though knowledge of this threshold is central to determining the earliest time point at which feeding <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected cat fleas may be infectious to a susceptible host, including humans.</p><p>Vector-borne pathogen transmission is considered biological if an incubation period is required before passage within the vector or consequent transmission to a new host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In contrast, mechanical transmission does not require multiplication or development of the organism within the vector, and transmission to a new host occurs by incidental contact with the vector, such as carriage by the insects&#x02019; legs, proboscis, or gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Frequently, biological and mechanical transmission of pathogens co-exists in the same geographic area, in the same hosts, and even by the same vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Another mode of transmission has been observed for the flea-borne bacterium of plague (<italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>), termed &#x0201c;early-phase&#x0201d;, where transmission occurs before a designated incubation period; but, certain aspects of this transmission event have impeded confirmation as to whether this is a biological or mechanical mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While horizontal transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by cat fleas via infectious saliva is considered biological, the specific mechanism utilized before <italic>R. felis</italic> disseminates to the salivary glands is unclear. Given that <italic>R. felis</italic> is frequently detected in other blood-feeding arthropods, demonstration of nonspecific mechanical transfer may incriminate other human-biting vectors in the transmission cycle of this pathogen.</p><p>In this study, we aimed first to designate the EIP of <italic>R. felis</italic> within cat fleas, and second to further elucidate the transmission mechanism (e.g. biological or mechanical) utilized by <italic>R. felis</italic> amongst co-feeding fleas prior to a disseminated arthropod infection. Given that pathogen transmission before passage within the vector would indicate that microbial replication and development in the arthropod are not required, we hypothesized that a mechanical mechanism is responsible for the observed early-phase transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> between co-feeding fleas. Horizontal transmission bioassays were developed in an artificial host system to assess temporal dynamics of <italic>R. felis</italic> between co-feeding cat fleas, including exposure time to produce infectious donor fleas and association time to transmit infection to recipient fleas. Following exposure to an infectious bloodmeal, additional experiments examined the proportion of cat fleas with <italic>R. felis</italic> present on their mouthparts, as well as the release of <italic>R. felis</italic> from food and/or salivary canals during subsequent feeding and/or probing events. The potential for mechanical transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by co-feeding cat fleas was further examined using fluorescent latex beads to simulate transfer of an inanimate object, which would not require a biological mechanism to achieve transmission. Our results indicate that not only are <italic>R. felis</italic>-exposed cat fleas infectious following a brief incubation period, but utilization of a mechanical mechanism may also explain the rapid rate of spread that typifies <italic>R. felis</italic> flea-borne transmission within experimental and computational models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Source of fleas and cultivation of <italic>Rickettsia</italic>-infected fleas</title><p>Newly emerged, <italic>Rickettsia</italic>-uninfected cat fleas (<italic>C. felis</italic> Bouche) were purchased from Elward II (Soquel, CA, USA), and reared within an artificial host system as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Although previous work did not detect the presence of <italic>R. felis</italic> in the salivary glands of cat fleas less than 7 dpe to an infectious bloodmeal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a portion of fleas (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100) from this study were dissected after a 24-h exposure period to confirm that original observation with a few procedural modifications (detailed below).

Sequence analyses were carried out using Vector NTI software (Invitrogen), and nucleotide similarities were compared using the GenBank database.</p><p>For the IFA, paired salivary glands were fixed in multi-well slides with ice-cold acetone for 10&#x000a0;min; then they were simultaneously permeabilized and blocked with 0.1&#x000a0;% Triton X-100 and 2&#x000a0;% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 15&#x000a0;min. Rickettsiae were labeled with a polyclonal antibody against <italic>Rickettsia</italic> organisms generated in rabbits (I7198 Anti-<italic>Rick</italic>) and created at the National Institutes of Health&#x02019;s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (generously donated by Ted Hackstadt). Anti-<italic>Rickettsia</italic> serum was diluted at 1:1000 in blocking buffer (0.1&#x000a0;% Triton X-100/2&#x000a0;% BSA solution), and then slides with the diluted primary antibody were incubated in the dark for 1&#x000a0;h. Additional slides in which no primary antibody was added served as a control for nonspecific binding, and were incubated with PBS for 1&#x000a0;h in the dark. Goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488 conjugate (Invitrogen) served as the secondary antibody, and was diluted at 1:1000 in blocking buffer (0.1&#x000a0;% Triton X-100/2&#x000a0;% BSA solution) and incubated in the dark for 1&#x000a0;h. Coverslips were mounted with VECTASHIELD&#x000ae; Hard Set&#x02122; with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc.) for nuclear counterstaining. Immunofluorescence assays on the upper half of the removed flea heads used an identical protocol, with the exception of the initial preparation of the tissue prior to fixation with acetone. Following flea dissections, each head was placed onto a slide within a circle drawn with a diamond point scriber (2 rows of 5 circles per slide). Multiple coverslips were placed over the entirety of the slide and the heads were then compressed between the coverslips and slide. Coverslips were then removed and discarded, and any large remnants of exoskeleton were detached from the slide with fine forceps to prevent trapping conjugate during the staining procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

For example, amongst the 30 flea species confirmed as competent vectors of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> in North America, <italic>X. cheopis</italic> showed the highest proportion of pathogen acquisition (70&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%) and transmission efficiency rates (30&#x02013;70&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, <italic>X. cheopis</italic> requires a long EIP (12&#x02013;16 dpe) before subsequent transmission of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> to others, and persistent <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection is typically followed by death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although <italic>X. cheopis</italic> is perceived as the most efficient vector of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, it transmits the plague bacterium inefficiently. Consequently, the EIP of a pathogen within a given arthropod is one of the most important factors affecting vector efficacy. The cat flea has demonstrated proficiency in both pathogen acquisition (30&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%) and transmission efficiency rates (10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;%) for <italic>R. felis</italic> in previous laboratory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but the length of time needed from ingestion to transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by cat fleas was not assessed. Furthermore, although <italic>R. felis</italic> is widely disseminated throughout the cat flea host (including the midgut epithelial cells, muscle cells, fat body, tracheal matrix, ovaries, epithelial sheath of testes and salivary glands), a correlation between rickettsial distribution in flea tissues and distinct transmission routes has not been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Our results demonstrated that donor cat fleas are infectious as early as 6 hpe to an <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected bloodmeal, but do not transmit <italic>R. felis</italic> if the association time with recipient fleas is 12&#x000a0;h or less. Interestingly, although more than 50&#x000a0;% of the donor cat fleas were infected with <italic>R. felis</italic> at 1 and 3 hpe, co-feeding transmission to na&#x000ef;ve fleas was not observed until 6 and 12 hpe in these bioassays. The initial assumption for the observed delay was that perhaps rickettsial loads within each donor flea group (1, 3, 6 and 12 hpe) influenced <italic>R. felis</italic> co-feeding transmission (i.e. transmission events were dose-dependent), but the only significant difference between rickettsial loads of donor cat fleas was at 3 and 6 hpe. This difference is not considered substantial because there was no transmission at 1 hpe and the highest proportion of transmission events occurred at 12 hpe; yet, rickettsial loads of donor cat fleas from 1 and 12 hpe were not significantly different from other time points. Surprisingly, co-feeding transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> to recipient fleas was not observed at any association time points (1, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;h) even though more than 60&#x000a0;% of the donor cat fleas were infected in all groups with comparable rickettsial loads. Therefore, similar to earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], co-feeding transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> between cat fleas is not dose-dependent; however, there is an incubation period required before transmission for reasons not currently understood.</p><p>Transmission of flea-borne pathogens may occur through several possible mechanisms, including: contaminated feces (e.g. <italic>R. typhi, B. henselae</italic>); soiled mouthparts (e.g. viral pathogens); regurgitation of gut contents (e.g. <italic>Y. pestis</italic>); and infectious saliva via infected salivary glands (e.g. <italic>R. felis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarities often exist between transmission routes utilized by rickettsial pathogens, but the flea-associated <italic>Rickettsia</italic>, <italic>R. typhi</italic> and <italic>R. felis,</italic> exhibit rather dissimilar transmission routes. Jointly, infection in the flea is initiated when ingested rickettsiae enter and replicate within the epithelial cells of the midgut. For <italic>R. typhi</italic>, the rickettsiae within the midgut cells are released into the gut lumen for excretion with feces at 10 dpe to an infectious host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For <italic>R. felis</italic>, the rickettsiae migrate from the midgut cells to the salivary glands for inoculation into hosts with flea saliva, roughly a 7&#x02013;14 day migration from the moment of arthropod ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Since the kinetics of bloodmeal-acquired <italic>R. felis</italic> in cat fleas was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], interpretation of other studies now suggests that transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by co-feeding cat fleas may occur prior to salivary gland infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similar to the kinetics account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the current study did not detect <italic>R. felis</italic> in the salivary glands of cat fleas following a short-term exposure event (24 hpe) by qPCR or IFA analyses; nevertheless, transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> between co-feeding cat fleas occurs at 24 hpe or less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Rickettsial DNA was, however, detected by qPCR in 10 and 4&#x000a0;% of the dissected flea heads (encompassing the mouthparts) at 24 and 48 hpe, respectively. Although no definitive organisms were detected from the heads via IFA, this may be due to the lower sensitivity of IFA when compared to qPCR analyses. Currently, the survival of <italic>R. felis</italic> on the external mouthparts of cat fleas is unknown, but it is possible that bacteria present in residual blood on the posterior portion of the flea mouthparts (or anterior pharynx) could survive environmental elements from within the flea&#x02019;s head capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The dissimilar transmission routes of flea-borne rickettsial species may also reflect differences between the feeding behavior of each vector, with <italic>C. felis</italic> and <italic>X. cheopis</italic> as the recognized biological vectors for <italic>R felis</italic> and <italic>R. typhi</italic>, respectively. Because <italic>X. cheopis</italic> feed so infrequently, once every 1&#x02013;3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], there is ample opportunity for <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp.&#x000a0;to replicate and escape the midgut cells before defecation on a host. In addition to fecal transmission, further studies revealed that <italic>X. cheopis</italic> infected for &#x0003e;&#x000a0;21&#x000a0;days were capable of transmitting <italic>R. typhi</italic> to hosts by bite; however, oral transmission of <italic>R. typhi</italic> is the result of regurgitation of excess <italic>Rickettsia</italic> present in the gut lumen of fleas rather than through salivary secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Due to the rapid feeding behavior (roughly 14&#x000a0;h total daily of intermittent feeds) and high turnover rate of gut contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected cat fleas are not known to regurgitate excess bacteria from the midgut during successive bloodmeal acquisition. A more likely scenario for transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> prior to salivary gland infection is that cat flea mouthparts harbor residual blood along the grooved surfaces that form the food and salivary canals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The general feeding behavior of many arthropods with piercing-sucking mouthparts is performed by a series of brief probes to locate capillaries within the vertebrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. During these probing events, bacteria present in the salivary grooves distal to the salivary pump would be driven into the bite site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that <italic>R. felis</italic> is released from contaminated mouthparts of cat fleas following exposure to an infectious bloodmeal as evidenced by nucleic acid isolation from Whatman&#x02122; FTA cards. Additionally, residual blood was deposited between intermittent feeds by probing cat fleas as visualized on these cards when access to blood was granted. Given that flea mouthparts were unable to penetrate through the card due to the thickness of the paper, the presence of these blood droplets is significant because it demonstrates the potential for remaining blood in the salivary canal to transfer with saliva into the next bite site. Due to the opposing hydrodynamic forces of the food and salivary canals, regurgitation of excess blood blocked before the prestomach by probing cat fleas seems unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, no visual evidence of probing was demonstrated when cat fleas were surface sterilized prior to placement with Whatman&#x02122; FTA cards and given no access to blood, yet <italic>R. felis</italic> was still detected using the same techniques; thus, highlighting that bacteria within the salivary grooves seems most prone to transmission during probing expeditions.</p><p>In the strictest sense of the delineation between a biological and mechanical mechanism, transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by cat fleas with no discernable EIP (e.g. transfer of <italic>R. felis</italic> before disseminated arthropod infection) would be classified as a mechanical mechanism. Moreover, the potential for declining transmission efficiency with additional bloodmeals (e.g. the proportion and infection load of <italic>R. felis</italic> in the head region of cat fleas decreased between 24 and 48 hpe) indicates that the source for early <italic>R. felis</italic> transmission is not sufficient for multiplication and persistence of the bacteria (another qualifier for a mechanical mechanism). However, early-phase transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> is not instantaneous, which is not compatible with a mechanical mechanism. A minimal incubation period is required before <italic>R. felis</italic> transmission may occur, but this interval is not dependent on the amount of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> ingested or replication of the bacteria within the flea. Similar observations have been documented for early-phase transmission of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, including a short incubation period (ranging from a few hours to 1&#x02013;2 dpe) and the lack of a correlation between bacterial loads and transmission events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The combination of results from early-phase transmission experiments suggests that the location of bacteria within the flea is a more important indicator of transmission outcome than the initial amount of bacteria present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] have proposed that the mechanical <italic>vs</italic> biological dichotomy is oversimplified, and suggested two other possible mechanisms of vector-borne transmission: ingestion-salivation and ingestion-egestion. Although currently classified as non-biological, these two mechanisms depend on adherence of the pathogen to the interior surfaces of the vector before subsequent inoculation during the next feeding event. The present study used fluorescent latex beads to demonstrate that early-phase transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by cat fleas is accomplished by a mechanical mechanism. The release of latex beads from feeding and/or probing cat fleas, as demonstrated through co-feeding bioassays and Whatman&#x02122; FTA cards, supports the notion that early-phase transmission is mechanical; however, mechanical, ingestion-salivation, and ingestion-egestion mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive. The minimal theoretical conditions required for mechanical transmission are (i) high parasitemia in donor vertebrate hosts; (ii) high density of potential mechanical arthropod vectors; (iii) high receptivity and susceptibility of a major part of potential recipient vertebrate hosts; and (iv) close contact between recipient and donor vertebrate hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Although systemic vertebrate infections with <italic>R. felis</italic> remain an occasional phenomenon with highly variable frequency and impact, these minimal conditions for mechanical transmission are met when the cat flea is considered the biological vector and reservoir host for this pathogen.</p><p>Utilization of both biological and mechanical mechanisms may be extremely advantageous depending on the transmission cycle of a pathogen. The majority of our current understanding of <italic>R. felis</italic> transmission is derived from cat flea colonies maintained on live cats or in an artificial host system. Remarkably, exploitation of both mechanisms by <italic>R. felis</italic> coincides with the general ecology of cat fleas associated with domestic cats. For example, on-host longevity of cat fleas is approximately eight&#x000a0;days due to the grooming efficiency of cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Thus, if the EIP for biological transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> by cat fleas is roughly the same amount of time as the average lifespan of the vector, then a mechanical mechanism must be used to safeguard the probability of pathogen transmission. Moreover, only about 5&#x000a0;% of cat fleas transfer from one cat host to another every seven&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. An immediate transfer to a second host is favorable for mechanical transmission, but weekly transfer rates of cat fleas was previously demonstrated as sufficient for the maintenance and persistence of <italic>R. felis</italic> within cat flea populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Intriguingly, the current study revealed that <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected cat fleas must co-feed with na&#x000ef;ve fleas for more than 12&#x000a0;h in order for transmission to occur. This rather lengthy association time needed to ensure <italic>R. felis</italic> transmission might reflect a crucial component in the vectorial capacity of cat fleas for this pathogen, such as the long-term persistent feeding behavior of cat fleas on the same vertebrate host compared to transient blood-feeding arthropods. Furthermore, migration to the salivary glands must be required for sustained transmission given that the presence of <italic>R. felis</italic> on the mouthparts of cat fleas declined between 24 and 48 hpe with the advent of an uninfected boodmeal. Similar results were found in a previous study when a portion of fresh blood was assessed for rickettsial DNA at 24 and 48 hpe to <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected cat fleas (3.3&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> and 3.0&#x000d7;10<sup>2</sup> rickettsiae per 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of blood, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Likely, intermittent feeding by cat fleas on the same host consists of both infected and uninfected bloodmeals because co-feeding transmission of <italic>R felis</italic> is dependent upon the close proximity (within a few centimeters) of infected and uninfected vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>R. felis</italic> does not appear to thrive, multiply or persist in a transmissible state under a mechanical mechanism alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The primary role of cat fleas in the transmission biology of <italic>R. felis</italic> has been well established; yet, transmission mechanisms utilized by <italic>R. felis</italic> within cat flea populations for sustaining enzootic cycles are less understood. In summary, our results demonstrate that cat fleas are infectious following a brief exposure to an <italic>R. felis</italic>-infected bloodmeal, and transmission of <italic>R. felis</italic> prior to dissemination within cat flea tissues is accomplished by a mechanical mechanism. The <italic>R. felis</italic>-<italic>C. felis</italic> relationship is truly unique in that most noncirculative, nonpersistent pathogens are generally not vector species-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; however, the demonstration of mechanical transmission may incriminate other human-biting vectors in the transmission cycle of this pathogen. A recent report has implicated mosquitoes as potential vectors of <italic>R. felis</italic> in regions of Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], where there is currently a debate as to whether cat fleas from that area possess a unique strain of <italic>R. felis</italic> or a different species entirely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given that <italic>R. felis</italic> has been detected molecularly in numerous arthropod species across the globe, there exists the potential for geographic-dependent vectors; although, additional studies will be required to discern the biological significance of <italic>R. felis</italic> infection in these various arthropod hosts.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term><italic>Cf</italic>18S</term><def><p>portion of <italic>C. felis</italic> 18S rRNA gene</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DNA</term><def><p>deoxyribonucleic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Dpe</term><def><p>days post-exposure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EIP</term><def><p>extrinsic incubation period</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>gDNA</term><def><p>genomic DNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HI</term><def><p>heat inactivated</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hpe</term><def><p>Hour(s) post-exposure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hr(s)</term><def><p>Hour(s)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFA</term><def><p>indirect immunofluorescent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISE6</term><def><p><italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> cell line</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LSU</term><def><p>Louisiana State University</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qPCR</term><def><p>quantitative real-time PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RB</term><def><p>Rhodamine B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>Rf</italic>17kDa</term><def><p>portion of <italic>R. felis</italic> 17-kDa antigen gene</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p>standard error of the mean</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LDB, LDF, and KRM conceived and designed the study; LDB performed all bioassays, PCR, qPCR, IFA, data analysis, and wrote the manuscript; KHB assisted with microscopy imaging and analysis.
