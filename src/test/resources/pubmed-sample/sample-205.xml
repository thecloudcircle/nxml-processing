In recent years, it is found to be overexpressed in different types of cancer tissues and cell lines including glioblastomas, neuroblastomas, melanomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing sarcomas and gastric cancers, suggesting that it may function as an oncogene in these cancers. However, its role in thyroid cancer remains totally unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the functions and related molecular mechanism of PAX3 in thyroid tumorigenesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays, we demonstrated that <italic>PAX3</italic> was frequently down-regulated by promoter methylation in both primary thyroid cancer tissues and thyroid cancer cell lines. In addition, our data showed that ectopic expression of PAX3 dramatically inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and retarded tumorigenic potential in nude mice. Mechanically, PAX3 exerted its tumor suppressor function by inhibiting the activity of major signaling pathways including the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways, and enhancing expression and activity of transcription factor FOXO3a. Altogether, our findings provided insight into the role of PAX3 as a novel functional tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer through modulating the activities of PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways and transcription factor FOXO3a, and demonstrated that epigenetic alterations such as promoter methylation should be a major mechanism of PAX3 inactivation in this cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>thyroid cancer</kwd><kwd>PAX3</kwd><kwd>PI3K/Akt pathway</kwd><kwd>MAPK/Erk pathway</kwd><kwd>FOXO3a</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The paired box (<italic>PAX/Pax</italic>) gene family is now recognized as potentially playing crucial roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and tissue development [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This family comprises nine members in humans (<italic>PAX1</italic>-<italic>PAX9</italic>) and mice (<italic>Pax1</italic>-<italic>Pax9</italic>), whereas they are further classified into four subgroups by structural similarity such as paired domain, homeodomain and octapeptide [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is now clear that there is a potential link between aberrant expression of <italic>PAX</italic> genes in adult tissues and a wide variety of cancers by promoting or inhibiting tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a member of <italic>PAX</italic> gene family, PAX3 has been found to be correlated with oncogenesis [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and is upregulated and highly expressed in glioblastomas, neuroblastomas, melanomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing sarcomas and gastric cancers [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These observations suggest that <italic>PAX3</italic> may be a potential oncogene in tumorigenesis. However, the function of <italic>PAX3</italic> in thyroid cancer is unclear.</p><p>As the most common endocrine malignancy, thyroid cancer has been rapidly increasing in many regions of the world including China [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Well-differentiated thyroid cancers (WDTCs), accounting for more than 90% of thyroid cancer, are composed of follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Usually, the patients with WDTCs have an excellent prognosis and can be curved by surgical and radioiodinated therapy. However, approximately 10% of cases can develop into more aggressive and dedifferentiated forms of thyroid cancer, leading to recurrent disease and death [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that epigenetic silencing of tumor-associated genes by promoter hypermethylation exerts a fundamental role in tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], considerable efforts have been recently done to identify novel target genes, which are silenced by promoter methylation and function as a putative tumor suppressor in human cancers including thyroid cancer.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated epigenetic silencing of <italic>PAX3</italic> by promoter methylation in a cohort of PTCs. A series of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed that ectopic expression of PAX3 dramatically inhibited cell growth and invasiveness in thyroid cancer cells through repressing the activities of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways and promoting FOXO3a activity. These findings support that <italic>PAX3</italic> functions as an oncosuppressor in thyroid tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Down-regulation of <italic>PAX3</italic> by promoter methylation in PTCs and thyroid cancer cell lines</title><p>We first examined mRNA expression of <italic>PAX3</italic> in 17 primary PTCs and matched non-cancerous thyroid tissues (control subjects) by using qRT-PCR approach. Although <italic>PAX3</italic> was not mainly expressed in thyroid epithelial cells, down-regulation of <italic>PAX3</italic> was still found in 14 of 17 (82.4%) PTCs as compared with control subjects (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Moreover, we also assessed the protein levels of PAX3 in PTCs and the matched non-cancerous tissues by western blotting. The results further demonstrated downregulation of PAX3 in PTCs compared with control subjects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These data suggest epigenetic silencing of <italic>PAX3</italic> in thyroid cancer. Next, we attempted to evaluate promoter methylation of <italic>PAX3</italic> in a large cohort of PTCs by using MSP assay. Our data showed that <italic>PAX3</italic> methylation was found in 118/178 (66.3%) PTCs, whereas it was only found in 3/23 (13.0%) control subjects. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> (upper panel) exhibited methylation status of two representative PTC cases. Similar to the findings in primary PTCs, full or partial methylation was detected in all of six thyroid cancer cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lower panel). Accordingly, <italic>PAX3</italic> was silenced in five of six thyroid cancer cell lines except for 8305C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). To further clarify whether <italic>PAX3</italic> is epigenetically silenced in thyroid cancer cells, we treated these cell lines with 5-Aza-dC or SAHA, respectively. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, 5-Aza-dC treatment significantly increased <italic>PAX3</italic> expression in all cell lines, further suggesting that transcriptional inactivation of <italic>PAX3</italic> was mediated by promoter methylation. Moreover, SAHA treatment also restored <italic>PAX3</italic> expression in most of cell lines except for C643. Taken together, these observations suggest that epigenetic silencing is one of the major causes underlying <italic>PAX3</italic> down-regulation in thyroid cancer.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title><italic>PAX3</italic> inactivation by promoter hypermethylation in primary PTCs and thyroid cancer cell lines</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) qRT-PCR assay was performed to evaluate mRNA expression of <italic>PAX3</italic> in primary PTCs and their matched non-cancerous thyroid tissues (<italic>n</italic> = 17). <italic>PAX3</italic> expression was normalized with <italic>18S</italic> rRNA levels.

As expected, PAX3 re-expression significantly increased the expression of p21, p27 and p16 compared with the control. Moreover, we also found that ectopic expression of PAX3 remarkably up-regulated the mRNA levels of <italic>p16</italic>, but not <italic>Rb</italic> in BCPAP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). A previous study has demonstrated that inhibition of MAPK/Erk pathway can up-regulate <italic>p16</italic> expression through promoter demethylation via down-regulating DNMT1 expression in colon cancer cells [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This was supported by our data that inhibition of MAPK/Erk pathway using MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 cascade up-regulated <italic>p16</italic> expression, down-regulated the expression of <italic>DNMT1</italic> and <italic>DNMT3b</italic>, and the expression of PRC2 components EZH2 and SUZ12 contributing to decreased levels of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Altogether, we speculated that PAX3 regulated <italic>p16</italic> expression through epigenetic mechanisms such as promoter methylation and H3K27me3 via inhibition of MAPK/Erk cascade. According to increased expression of p16 upon PAX3 re-expression, the expression of p-Rb protein was dramatically reduced in PAX3-tranfected cells compared with control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), suggesting the role of the p16/Rb signaling in PAX3-mediated cell cycle arrest. Next, we investigated the impact of PAX3 re-expression on the levels of apoptosis-associated proteins including p53, Bax, Bak, Smac, activated caspase-3 and -9. The results showed that the levels of p53 and Bax were not changed by ectopic expression of PAX3, whereas the levels of Bak, Smac, activated caspase-3 and -9 were significantly increased in PAX3-transfected cells compared with control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><p>Given that p21, a major downstream target of p53, can be up-regulated by PAX3 through a p53-independent pathway, we thus suppose that PAX3 may modulate p21 expression through unknown mechanisms. It has been reported that transcription factor FOXO3a, another downstream effector of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], can also regulate a panel of downstream genes at transcriptional levels. Some of them are related with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, we next evaluated the influence of PAX3 re-expression on FOXO3a activity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, ectopic expression of PAX3 up-regulated FOXO3a expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Moreover, our data showed that PAX3 restoration slightly suppressed phosphorylation of FOXO3a in BCPAP cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Similar results were also found in another thyroid cancer cell line FTC133 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). There is strong evidence showing that FOXO3a is post-transcriptionally regulated by some signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Activation of Akt phosphorylates FOXO3a at several conservative sites such as Ser 253, Thr 32 and Ser 315 and initiates its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and ultimately targets it for proteasome degradation [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, our results showed that PAX3 re-expression also caused a significant nuclear accumulation of non-phosphorylated FOXO3a in BCPAP cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). FOXO3a may serve as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of its targets when it is localized in the nucleus [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, we next tested the effect of ectopic expression of PAX3on expression of a set of FOXO3a downstream targets, including cell cycle-related genes such as <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>p27</italic>, <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, <italic>p130</italic> and <italic>GADD45a</italic>, and apoptosis-related genes such as <italic>Bim</italic> and <italic>TRAIL</italic>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, PAX3 re-expression significantly up-regulated the expression of <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>p27</italic>, <italic>p130</italic>, <italic>Bim</italic> and <italic>TRAIL</italic>, and down-regulated <italic>cyclin D1</italic> expression in BCPAP cells. Moreover, we also evaluated the effect of ectopic expression of PAX3 on expression of <italic>p53</italic> and its two downstream target genes <italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Fas</italic> in the same cell line. As expected, PAX3 re-expression did not affect the expression of these two genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Notably, we accidently found that PAX3 re-expression up-regulated the expression of transcription factor ZIC1 in BCPAP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). Our previous study has demonstrated that ZIC1 contributes to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through a p53-independent pathway via enhancing FOXO3a transcriptional activity [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, we speculated that PAX3 also regulated the expression and activity of FOXO3a possibly by promoting ZIC1 expression via other unknown mechanisms.</p><p>Given that oncogenic function of PAX3 has been previously reported in other cancers such as glioblastomas and melanomas [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we attempted to determine the role of PAX3 in glioblastoma cell line U251 and melanoma cell line A375. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>, our data showed that PAX3 re-expression increased phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a in U251 cells and phosphorylation of Erk in A375 cells, suggesting that PAX3 plays a tumor-promoting role in glioblastomas and melanomas probably through activating these signaling pathways. These results further demonstrate that PAX3 indeed plays the distinct biological roles in different types of cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2_7"><title>Inhibition of the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the expression of metastasis-associated genes by PAX3</title><p>Given that EMT is a biological process inducing migratory and invasive capabilities and promoting tumor metastasis [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we thus attempted to clarify the correlation between PAX3 and the EMT process in this study.

Further studies revealed that <italic>PAX3</italic> inactivation was strongly related with promoter methylation. This was supported by our data that demethylation treatment significantly up-regulated <italic>PAX3</italic> expression in thyroid cancer cells. In addition, we found that SAHA treatment restored <italic>PAX3</italic> expression in these cells, indicating that histone deacetylation may also contribute to <italic>PAX3</italic> inactivation in addition to promoter methylation in thyroid cancer cells.</p><p><italic>PAX3</italic> inactivation may abrogate tumor suppression, and promote thyroid tumorgenesis. Thus, we tested the role of PAX3 in thyroid cancer cells by a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Our data first demonstrated strong tumor suppressive activity of PAX3 in thyroid cancer through inhibiting cell growth and invasiveness. To better understand the mechanism of PAX3 as an oncosuppressor in thyroid cancer, we tested the effect of PAX3 re-expression on the PI3K/Akt and MAPK cascades in thyroid cancer cells. These two pathways as major therapeutic targets play an important role in thyroid tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We found that ectopic expression of PAX3 strongly reduced phosphorylation of Akt and Erk, supporting that PAX3 exerts tumor suppressor function in thyroid cancer through modulating the activity of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways.</p><p>It is clear that p53 is an important determinant factor of cell cycle and apoptosis in tumorigenesis. In this study, we tested the effect of PAX3 on p53 signaling. Our data showed that PAX3 re-expression did not change the expression of p53 and its targets <italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Fas</italic>, whereas remarkably affected the expression of a set of cell cycle and apoptosis-associated genes. For example, p21, a well-known downstream target of p53, was increased by PAX3 at both mRNA and protein levels. Thus, we speculate that PAX3 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism. Indeed, in this study, we found that PAX3 re-expression significantly increased the expression and activity of transcription factor FOXO3a. Accumulated evidences have demonstrated that FOXO3a plays an important role as a critical transcription factor in tumorigenesis through transcriptionally regulating cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes in a p53-independent manner [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This was supported by our findings that ectopic expression of PAX3 markedly up- regulated FOXO3a downstream target genes, such as <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>p27</italic>, <italic>p130</italic>, <italic>Bim</italic> and <italic>TRAIL</italic>, and down-regulated another target gene <italic>cyclin D1</italic> in thyroid cancer cells. These genes have been well demonstrated to be involved in regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis during tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Taken together, given that tumor suppressor p53 is frequently inactivated by missense mutations or deletion in undifferentiated thyroid cancers [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], restoring or increasing FOXO3a transcriptional activity should be an effective strategy for the treatment of such cancers. In addition, our data showed that PAX3 up-regulated p16 expression, subsequently resulting in inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. These results suggest that PAX3 also induces cell cycle arrest in thyroid cancer cells by modulating p16/Rb/E2F signaling.</p><p>FOXO3a can also be post-transcriptionally regulated by the PI3K/Akt or MAPK/Erk pathways [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The PI3K/Akt signal-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3a can not only decrease its transcriptional activity through disrupting its interaction with gene promoter, but also promote its proteasome degradation [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There are evidences showing that FOXO3a is inactivated by over-activation of PI3K/Akt cascade [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, aberrant MAPK/Erk signaling can also phosphorylate FOXO3a at multiple residues, subsequently promoting its degradation by the proteasome pathway [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Given that phosphorylation of Akt and Erk was strongly inhibited by PAX3, we conclude that PAX3 enhances FOXO3a transcriptional activity by suppression of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk cascades. Strikingly, we found that ectopic expression of PAX3 up-regulated the expression of ZIC1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, in this study. We have previously demonstrated that ZIC1 not only inhibits phosphorylation of Akt and Erk, but also increases FOXO3a transcriptional activity in thyroid cancer cells [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of ZIC1 by PAX3 remains to be explored. Collectively, these results suggest that PAX3 regulates the expression and activity of FOXO3a through multiple mechanisms in thyroid cancer.</p><p>The EMT, as a vital step of tumor transformation cascade, is closely associated with cancer progression and metastasis [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this study, we found that PAX3 re-expression up-regulated epithelial marker E-cadherin accompanying with decreased expression of E-cadherin transcription suppressors <italic>Snail</italic>, <italic>Slug</italic> and <italic>Twist</italic>. Additionally, it down-regulated mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin. These findings reveal that PAX3 inhibits cell metastasis by repressing EMT process in thyroid cancer. FOXO3a has been demonstrated to rescue E-cadherin from Snail and Twist mediated inhibition, resulting in the suppression of EMT [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is also clear that multiple complex signaling systems such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways are required for induction of EMT [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, we can conclude that PAX3 inhibits the process of EMT by blocking the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk cascades and enhancing expression and activity of FOXO3a in thyroid cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of PAX3 in thyroid cancer cells strongly inhibited the expression of <italic>MMP</italic>-<italic>2</italic>, -<italic>9</italic> and -<italic>14</italic>, suggesting that PAX3-induced metastasis suppression is also related with the activity of MMPs.</p><p>The previous studies have reported that PAX3 may play an oncogenic function in some cancers such as glioblastomas and melanomas [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], whereas our data suggest that PAX3 acts as an oncosuppressor in thyroid cancer. Thus, we speculate that PAX3 derived from different types of cells or tissues may play distinct functions in tumorigenesis. In general, the binding site of transcription factor PAX3 is conservative in different tissues or cells. However, its specific function may be dependent on other factors. For example, PAX3 may form a complex with other nuclear factors and such interaction enhance or repress its transcriptional activity and defines the specificity of its targets. In addition, certain posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitinylation, phosphorylation or acetylation may also affect the activity of PAX3 by regulating its cellular localization, DNA-binding activity and stability.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that PAX3 is a novel oncosuppressor, and is frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in thyroid cancer. Our results are consistent with a model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), in which PAX3 inhibits thyroid tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and suppressing tumor metastasis through blocking the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways and promoting FOXO3a activity.</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Schematic model of molecular mechanisms underlying tumor suppressive activity of PAX3 in thyroid cancer</title><p>PAX3 increases the expression of <italic>FOXO3a</italic> at transcriptional levels through up-regulating ZIC1 expression or other unknown mechanisms. Meanwhile, PAX3 inhibits phosphorylation of FOXO3a, nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation and proteasome degradation through blocking the activity of PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, subsequently enhancing FOXO3a transcriptional activity in thyroid cancer cells. Downstream targets of FOXO3a exert tumor suppressive function through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor metastasis. Moreover, PAX3 can also regulate cell cycle through modulating p16/Rb/E2F pathway via inhibition of major signaling pathways such as MAPK/Erk cascade.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-07-54744-g008"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Clinical samples and DNA isolation</title><p>With the approval of institutional review board and human ethics committee, a total of 178 paraffin-embedded PTC tissues were randomly obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University.
