We report here a new experimental and computational evolution-based methodology to address this question and report its preliminary application to elucidating a mode of co-evolution of the frame-shifted overlapping ORFs in the adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2 viral genome. These ORFs encode both capsid VP protein and non-structural assembly-activating protein (AAP). To show proof of principle of the new method, we focused on the evolutionarily conserved QVKEVTQ and KSKRSRR motifs, a pair of overlapping heptapeptides in VP and AAP, respectively. In the new method, we first identified a large number of capsid-forming VP3 mutants and functionally competent AAP mutants of these motifs from mutant libraries by experimental directed evolution under no co-evolutionary constraints. We used Illumina sequencing to obtain a large dataset and then statistically assessed the viability of VP and AAP heptapeptide mutants. The obtained heptapeptide information was then integrated into an evolutionary algorithm, with which VP and AAP were co-evolved from random or native nucleotide sequences <italic>in silico</italic>. As a result, we demonstrate that these two heptapeptide motifs could exhibit high degeneracy if coded by separate nucleotide sequences, and elucidate how overlap-evoked co-evolutionary constraints play a role in making the VP and AAP heptapeptide sequences into the present shape. Specifically, we demonstrate that two valine (V) residues and &#x003b2;-strand propensity in QVKEVTQ are structurally important, the strongly negative and hydrophilic nature of KSKRSRR is functionally important, and overlap-evoked co-evolution imposes strong constraints on serine (S) residues in KSKRSRR, despite high degeneracy of the motifs in the absence of co-evolutionary constraints.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Public Health Service grant (R01 DK078388) and a Sponsored Research Fund from Takara Bio Inc, and in part by the National Institutes of Health through resources provided by the National Resource for Biomedical Supercomputing (P41 RR06009), which is part of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.

Having an alternative ORF in one gene is a tactic for viruses to accommodate a necessary quantity of genetic information within a limited capacity of their genomes <xref rid="pone.0066211-Chirico1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In such genomic organization, a synonymous mutation or a beneficial non-synonymous mutation in one ORF may result in a deleterious amino acid change in the overlapping ORF. Therefore, overlapping ORFs must undergo co-evolution in a sophisticated manner. How viral overlapping ORFs emerged, evolved, and became fixed under strong overlap-evoked co-evolutionary constraints has been a compelling question. To date, this question has been addressed primarily by homologous sequence alignment studies. Keese and Gibbs have proposed a mechanism called overprinting, by which new mutations are introduced in a pre-existing ORF, giving birth to a second ORF therein <xref rid="pone.0066211-Keese1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Subsequent studies have also lent strong support to the idea that overprinting is a mechanism for the origination of many viral overlapping genes <xref rid="pone.0066211-Pavesi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Firth1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Rancurel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sabath1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This evolutionary process has been shown to result in codon usage bias, reduced synonymous amino acid substitutions, higher contents of six-fold degenerate amino acid residues, and higher degrees of conservation associated with slower evolution <xref rid="pone.0066211-Miyata1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Pavesi2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Pavesi3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The identification of such molecular signatures has led to discovery of new overlapping ORFs in viral genomes <xref rid="pone.0066211-Pavesi2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Firth2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sabath2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the fundamental question still remains as to how co-evolutionary constraints play roles at individual amino acid levels in making newly emerging overlapping ORFs into their present shapes. Despite the prevalence of overlapping ORFs in viral genomes, such a question is difficult to address by conventional sequence alignment approaches, particularly when no evolutionary diversity of amino acids coded by shared nucleotides is found in either of the overlapping ORFs.</p><p>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising gene delivery vehicle for human gene therapy <xref rid="pone.0066211-Maguire1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Manno1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Nathwani1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It was recently discovered that the viral genomes of various AAV serotypes contain a frame-shifted alternative ORF of approximately 0.6 kb in length completely embedded within the 2.2-kb ORF coding the capsid VP protein <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sonntag1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sonntag2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This second ORF encodes the non-structural assembly-activating protein (AAP), a nucleolar protein indispensable for virion assembly <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sonntag1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sonntag2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. AAP transports VP to the nucleoli where the VP proteins assemble into capsids. This transport is mediated by the VP-AAP interaction through a hydrophobic amino acid-rich domain in the N-terminus of AAP and the 2-fold symmetry axis region in the capsid composed of amino acids near the C-terminus of VP <xref rid="pone.0066211-Naumer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, AAP induces conformational changes of VP monomers and oligomers to promote capsid assembly <xref rid="pone.0066211-Naumer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Such new knowledge about AAP has furthered our understanding of the mechanism involved in AAV capsid assembly. In the meantime, the discovery of the VP/AAP-overlapping ORFs has raised a possibility that some or many of the evolutionarily highly conserved amino acids in VP and AAP within the overlapping regions are conserved not due to structural and/or functional significance of these amino acids themselves, but due to co-evolutionary constraints imposed by structural and/or functional constraints of the superimposing amino acids in the overlapping ORF protein product. This VP/AAP overlap confounds the interpretation of evolutionary conservation of each amino acid in the VP and AAP proteins.</p><p>Here we report a new methodology that overcomes the above-mentioned limitation of the conventional homologous sequence alignment approaches in interpreting the nature of amino acid conservation in proteins coded by viral overlapping ORFs. The new method exploits experimental directed evolution <xref rid="pone.0066211-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Grimm1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Yuen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Adachi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, Illumina sequencing <xref rid="pone.0066211-Bentley1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and evolutionary computing <xref rid="pone.0066211-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. To show proof-of-principle of this method, we focused on a particular set of evolutionarily conserved overlapping VP and AAP heptapeptide motifs, QVKEVTQ and KSKRSRR, coded by the AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) VP and AAP ORFs, respectively. AAV2 is the prototype AAV that was first isolated and has been most extensively studied for viral structure, function and life cycle; therefore, AAV2 was used for this study. As a result, we could successfully elucidate the significance of conservation of individual amino acid residues in the evolutionarily conserved heptapeptide motifs in VP and AAP, and gain insights into how overlapping VP and AAP ORFs in the AAV2 genome emerged and have co-evolved at individual amino acid levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The N-terminal Two-fifths of the VP3 Protein is Highly Conserved: what has Imposed Evolutionary Constraints?</title><p>A sequence alignment analysis of VP proteins of 128 AAVs isolated from various animal species reveals that many amino acids in the VP protein within the amino (N)-terminal two-fifths of the VP3 protein are evolutionarily highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066211-g001">

</xref>). Until the discovery of AAP, the strong evolutionary conservation in this region was deemed to be attributed primarily to the structural constraints imposed by the core structure of the VP protein including the &#x003b2;-barrel <xref rid="pone.0066211-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this respect, the discovery of AAP has challenged the traditional view of the mechanism of the amino acid conservation in this region. When co-evolution of VP and AAP is taken into account, a question arises as to which of structural, functional and overlap-evoked co-evolutionary constraints restrict the diversity of amino acids at each position within this overlapping region of the VP protein. This question is difficult to address by conventional approaches, but could be answered by the new method reported here.</p><fig id="pone-0066211-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0066211.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The VP/AAP overlapping ORFs in the AAV2<italic>cap</italic> gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Organization of the <italic>cap</italic> gene and evolutionary conservation of the VP proteins.

We first addressed this question. To this end, we took an experimental directed evolution approach in the absence of overlap-evoked co-evolutionary constraints, and identified many viable mutants of each of the QVKEVTQ and KSKRSRR motifs in the VP/AAP-overlapping ORFs by Illumina sequencing. Such overlap-evoked co-evolutionary constraint-free evolution of VP and AAP was possible by taking a transcomplementation approach <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sonntag1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We constructed two AAV plasmid libraries, pAAV2-RepVP3-Lib-0 and pAAV2-CMV-cmAAP-Lib-0 with the diversity of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066211-g002">

In these libraries, the 21-nucleotide-long sequence in the AAV2 viral genome corresponding to QVKEVTQ in VP3 ORF or that corresponding to KSKRSRR in AAP ORF was replaced with random 21-mer nucleotides. The AAV2-RepVP3 genome expresses all the AAV Rep proteins and VP3 protein, but does not express VP1, VP2 or AAP protein. To make AAV2-RepVP3 viral particles, wild type codon-modified (cm) AAP (cmAAP) was provided in trans (<italic>i.e.</italic>, transcomplementation). The AAV2-CMV-cmAAP genome expresses only cmAAP. In the directed evolution procedure for VP3, we transfected HEK293 cells with pAAV2-RepVP3-Lib-0 together with helper plasmids to produce AAV2-RepVP3-Lib-1 (Step 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066211-g002">

When we ranked the identified heptapeptide mutant clones according to their sequence read numbers obtained by Illumina sequencing, the highest rank of the clones with one or more stop codons within the heptapeptide regions in the library Lib-3 was 145 and all the top-ranked 144 clones had no stops. To investigate whether or not a majority of the 144 clones, if not all, represent viable mutant clones positively selected by the directed evolution procedure, we took 5 independent approaches as follows. First, we tracked evolutional history of the positively selected clones. We could track evolutional history in 98 of the 144 clones and found that the GGGGGGG clone ranked 144 in the library Lib-3 showed steady extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066211-g003">

Second, the null hypothesis that the top-ranked 143 clones with no stops represent a pool of clones that were randomly selected from the library, was rejected by taking into account the frequency of clones with a stop(s) in the library Lib-0, which was found to be 15.4% (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.7&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>, binomial test). Third, as detailed in the following section, biochemical characterization of the heptapeptides revealed that the clones ranked 250 or higher, including the top-ranked 143 clones, were significantly more hydrophobic than the clones in the library Lib-0 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> to 6.1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, Mann-Whitney U-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066211-g003">

In the wild type QVKEVTQ heptapeptide sequence, the amino acid residues at P1, P2, P3 and P4 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, QVKE) form a &#x003b2;-strand while those at P5, P6 and P7 exhibit a coil that does not have a regular secondary structure <xref rid="pone.0066211-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

The VP heptapeptide sequence was also influenced, though to a lesser degree, resulting in some changes in the amino acid compositions. At P3, a basic amino acid histidine (H), which was found in 24% and 20% of experimentally and computationally evolved VP heptapeptides, respectively, was eliminated during the computational co-evolution. Leucine (L) was the major amino acid found at P7 in the VP heptapeptide under single evolution, but it became less favored under co-evolution.

In addition, the comparison between singly evolved and co-evolved QVKEVTQ/KSKRSRR-derived heptapeptide sequences provides an alternative means to investigate which amino acids are under overlap-evoked co-evolutionary constraints to what extent. Remarkable amino acid composition changes were observed at the P1, P3 and P7 in VP and P2 and P5 positions in AAP, indicating that these positions are under strong co-evolutionary constraints. Less pronounced changes were also observed in other positions except for the P2 and P5 in VP and P4 and P6 in AAP. Taken all together, our study using the experimental and computational evolution approaches demonstrates that, in the VP/AAP-overlapping heptapeptide region we studied, the two valine (V) residues in VP pose the primary structural and positional constraints and are the source of the co-evolutionary cascade, which subsequently restricts the choice of amino acids in AAP and those in other positions in VP directly and/or indirectly in concert with the AAP-originating biochemical constraints.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>K321 is Important for Viral Infectivity</title><p>The lysine (K) at P3 in VP (<italic>i.e.</italic>, K321) is strongly conserved in nature.

In our model, the primitive QVKEVTQ ORF in VP, which might have coded a heptapeptide that was different from the present-day sequence, but likely had the xVxxVxx sequence motif, was selected as the region where the primitive AAP would overprint a +1 frame-shifted ORF coding a heptapeptide with the AAP KSKRSRR function. Conforming to this assumption, back-translation of AAV2 VP1 into all possible nucleotide sequences and subsequent translation using the +1 frame reveals that the QVKEVTQ-coding nucleotide region is the best fit for accommodating the +1 frame-shifted heptapeptides showing the biochemical properties characteristic for those exhibiting the AAP KSKRSRR function (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066211.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>).

Our original motive for the initiation of this study was to address a hypothesis that the evolutionarily highly conserved protein regions coded by the VP/AAP-overlapping ORFs, such as QVKEVTQ/KSKRSRR heptapeptide motifs we focused on in this study, would show significant evolutionary diversity if they were coded by independent ORFs. Since nature would not allow proteins coded by overlapping ORFs to evolve independently, conventional sequence alignment approaches are not able to address this hypothesis. Therefore, we established a new AAV directed evolution approach based on transcomplementation, where we let random VP and AAP mutants evolve into capsid-forming viable mutants by supplying AAP and VP expressed from separate DNA templates in trans, respectively, in HEK293 cells. By taking this experimental evolution approach in combination with Illumina sequencing, we could obtain a number of viable VP and AAP mutants showing significant sequence diversity. This demonstrates that the above-mentioned hypothesis is true at least to the heptapeptide motifs we chose for this study. When viewed in the light of gene therapy research, this observation may have implication in the development of new AAV vectors. This is because introduction of various mutations in the evolutionarily highly conserved N-terminal two-fifths of VP3 may potentially be tolerated and some of these new AAV species might have unforeseen attractive biological features for gene therapy applications. Further studies are needed to understand the degree of degeneracy of amino acid sequences in other regions in the VP/AAP-overlapping ORFs.</p><p>Various computational models have been utilized to study co-evolution of biological molecules. Computational methods for prediction of overlapping genes have been developed and successfully used to discover new viral overlapping genes <xref rid="pone.0066211-Pavesi2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Firth2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Sabath2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Computational methods have also been used to identify co-evolved covariant amino acid residues in viral proteins and find structurally or functionary important residues that undergo co-evolution through intra- or inter-protein interactions <xref rid="pone.0066211-Fares1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Bruni1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Kalinina1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. These methods are all purely computational and bioinformatics-based methods. In contrast, the computational evolution method described here takes an approach distinct from the above-mentioned approaches in that it employs a data-driven computational model that empirically predicts how VP/AAP-overlapping ORFs co-evolve based on a large set of biological observations obtained from wet lab experiments. Such an approach was not realistic until recently, but has become possible through the emergence of the next-generation sequencing technologies that can generate a massive amount of data with minimal time and effort. The power of this data-driven computational approach is exemplified by our demonstration that the two serine (S) residues at P2 and P5 in the KSKRSRR motif in AAP are evolutionarily highly conserved not due to the structural or functional significance of these serine (S) residues in the context of AAP, but due primarily to the structural constraints originating from the superimposed QVKEVTQ motif in VP. The experimental evolution study showed that glycine (G), alanine (A) and proline (P) could substitute serine (S) residues to exert the AAP KSKRSRR function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066211-g003">
<bold>Figure 3C</bold>
</xref>). AAP has 5 serine (S)/threonine (T)-rich domains comprising 5 to 7 residues; and of these 5 S/T-rich domains, the two evolutionarily conserved ones located at T77 to T82 and S124 to T128 have recently been shown to tolerate amino acid substitutions in maintaining the capsid assembly function of AAP <xref rid="pone.0066211-Naumer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Based on the result of the mutagenesis study, Naumer et al. has suggested the functional redundancy of the S/T-rich motifs assuming that these motifs in fact have a functional role <xref rid="pone.0066211-Naumer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, the results of our study raise an alternative possibility that the richness of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues in these two regions, T77 to T82 and S124 to T128, is a consequence of structural and/or functional constraints on the superimposed VP regions, which are also evolutionarily conserved. The combinatorial approach using experimental directed evolution and data-driven computational model presented here will answer this question when it is applied to the S/T-rich regions in our future experiments.</p><p>Although the new method is powerful in studying co-evolution of viral overlapping ORFs at individual amino acid levels, it should not be mistaken for a method that can perfectly reproduce how overlapping ORFs have evolved in nature. In nature, co-evolutionary constrains imposed on proteins coded by overlapping ORFs not only originate from the shared genetic information, but also may originate from intra- and inter-protein interactions of co-evolving amino acid residues. Examples of the latter are covariance of viral envelope amino acid residues that are non-contiguous in primary structure <xref rid="pone.0066211-Bruni1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Travers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066211-Korber1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and co-evolution of ligands and their cognate receptors <xref rid="pone.0066211-Um1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, virus-host interaction may play a role in viral evolution, where viruses have evolved a plethora of strategies to counteract host innate and acquired immune responses that eliminate pathogens. Although AAV does not express any known modulators for immune evasion, low immunogenicity of AAV may be a trait acquired by evolution. In the method presented here, we applied a simplified system in which we let only the heptapeptides of interest undergo evolution and did not allow other regions or proteins to evolve during the experimental period or did not consider evolutionary adaptation processes in the context of virus-host interactions. Therefore, the molecular evolution we simulated in cultured cells and <italic>in silico</italic> is an artificial evolutionary process and does not reproduce all aspects of evolution in nature. Although this caveat needs to be kept in mind, the new method should be valid for studying conserved amino acids in proteins coded by overlapping ORFs within the AAV genome because this artificial evolution system could successfully interpret the peculiar sequence features of the heptapeptide motifs incorporated into the context of the present-day amino acid sequences of VP and AAP. The simplest structure of AAV and lack of expression of viral immune modulators would make AAV a straightforward model to study co-evolution of viral overlapping ORFs using the method reported here.</p><p>In summary, the new method successfully dissects the mode of co-evolution of overlapping ORFs at individual amino acid levels and significantly advances our understanding of how viral overlapping genes emerged and have undergone co-evolution. This methodology can be applied to study of other regions in the overlapping AAV genes, will potentially be extendable to study of overlapping ORFs in other viral species, and will allow us to address questions that are difficult to answer by conventional sequence alignment-based approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid Construction</title><p>pCMV-FLAG-cmAAP is a plasmid expressing a codon-modified version of AAV2 AAP with a FLAG tag under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediately early gene enhancer/promoter.
