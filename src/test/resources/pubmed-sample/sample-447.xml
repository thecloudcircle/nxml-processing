CD55, a cell surface complement regulatory protein that promotes protective and anti-inflammatory properties, is reportedly an NF-&#x003ba;B target gene transiently induced in monocytic cells by the bacterial endotoxin LPS. CD55 is elevated on white cells in women experiencing preterm labor (a pathophysiology commonly associated with bacterial infection) and failure to maintain CD55 was associated with subsequent preterm delivery. We examined the influence of vitamin D3 signaling on LPS-induced expression of CD55 in human monocytic THP-1 cells using quantitative PCR, immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and NF-&#x003ba;B activation pathway inhibitors. Non-NF-&#x003ba;B targets CD14 and CD11b, which modulate bacterial surveillance and eradication, respectively, were also examined. LPS produced a rapid transient 1.6-fold increase in CD55 mRNA. 1,25-D3 alone did not affect CD55 mRNA expression within the first 48 h. However, in 1,25-D3 pretreated cells, LPS produced a &#x0003e;4-fold immediate and sustained increase in CD55 mRNA and protein expression, which was blocked by NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors. Our results unexpectedly suggest that vitamin D3 signaling may promote an anti-inflammatory response through an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent increase in CD55 expression. As expected, LPS or 1,25-D3 alone led to sustained increases in CD14 and CD11b expression. In 1,25-D3 pretreated cells, LPS differentially regulated protein expression - CD14 (21-fold increase) and CD11b (a transient 2-fold decrease) - principally at the posttranscriptional level. The coordinated temporal expression of CD55, CD14 and CD11b would contribute to an anti-inflammatory response by providing protection against complement-mediated cell lysis during pathogen recognition and eradication. Overall, the vitamin D3 system may play a role coordinating an anti-inflammatory response pattern of the host complement immune system. This may be particularly important when considering the high rates of preterm births in blacks, a population that exhibits reduced circulating vitamin D3 levels.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Public Health Service grant HD055648 (to SN), HD041687 (to BJN and SN) and U54 RR026140 (to SN).

All serum exposed cells express cell surface complement regulatory proteins such as CD55 <xref rid="pone.0049318-Lublin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which CD55 expression is regulated during the inflammatory response remain largely unexplored. CD55 is a key regulator affecting all three complement activation pathways and can display a net anti-inflammatory role working via several different mechanisms. It intrinsically dissociates (or prevents) the association of C3/C5 convertases that assemble on the cell surface thereby blocking cell surface complement activation and subsequent formation of lytic membrane attack complexes <xref rid="pone.0049318-Lukacik1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. CD55-mediated inhibition of complement activation downstream of the C3 component allows it to act as an anti-inflammatory mediator by preventing the production of soluble C3a and C5a, thereby regulating the induction of local and systemic inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0049318-Wuding1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Khl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. CD55 is also an immunological anti-adhesive molecule implicated in the resolution of ongoing inflammation of mucosal epithelia through clearance of transmigrating neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0049318-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Depending on the temporally regulated balance of local pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, monocytic cell lineages participate in a variety of seemingly disparate physiological processes including innate and adaptive immuno-surveillance and tissue repair and remodeling <xref rid="pone.0049318-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Both their dynamic temporal responsiveness to pathogens and locally produced mediators, and their ability to either exacerbate or attenuate diseases, make monocytes attractive therapeutic targets <xref rid="pone.0049318-Saha1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Several receptors, such as the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-integrin complement receptor (CR) 3 (&#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, CD11b/CD18) and CD14, whose expression is elevated on mature monocytes and macrophages, play key roles in acute inflammatory signaling, the innate eradication of infection, and clearance of cellular debris. As such, they lead toward the resolution of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0049318-Sendide1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049318-Hawley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. CR3 influences cellular migration and mediates internalization of iC3b and non-opsonized particles <xref rid="pone.0049318-Ehlers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-LeCabec1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The LPS binding protein CD14 is a co-regulator for innate immune pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition signal transduction receptors and functions as a sensitivity rheostat in pathogen surveillance <xref rid="pone.0049318-Gangloff1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. CD14 also plays a role in CR3-dependent phagocytosis <xref rid="pone.0049318-Sendide1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Hawley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. While the early stages of pathogen eradication and/or clearance of damaged human cells are essential components in the resolution of inflammation, inappropriate and excessive activation of the complement system may lead to injury of bystander intact tissue and a chronic pro-inflammatory response. Therefore, sufficient expression of anti-inflammatory CD55 is necessary to balance complement-mediated pro-inflammatory responses.</p><p>Our previous studies demonstrated that CD55 expression is elevated in peripheral leukocytes of women with preterm labor (PTL); further all PTL subjects diagnosed with urogenital infections exhibited elevated levels of CD55 <xref rid="pone.0049318-Nowicki1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Pacheco1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We speculated that the upregulation of CD55 may occur in response to the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin. LPS principally leads to a transient activation of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref rid="pone.0049318-Ruland1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, a major signal transduction molecule utilized in the regulation of proinflammatory immune responses <xref rid="pone.0049318-Bonizzi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, LPS signaling directly and indirectly orchestrates a complex and time dependent gene expression program in monocytic cell lineages <xref rid="pone.0049318-Sharif1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For example, while neither CD14 nor CD11b are NF-&#x003ba;B target genes <xref rid="pone.0049318-Schreiber1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, LPS induces their expression in monocytic cell types. Upregulation of CD55 expression has been demonstrated using primary cultures of heterogeneous populations of human peripheral leukocytes <xref rid="pone.0049318-Christmas1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> or monocyte-derived dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0049318-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> after 24 or 48 hours of LPS exposure, respectively. A genome-scale promoter survey identified CD55 as a potential NF-&#x003ba;B target gene and demonstrated, using human primary macrophage and microchip analysis, that CD55 mRNA pools exhibited an early 2 h transient increase in size, followed by a later increase at 24 h <xref rid="pone.0049318-Schreiber1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Whether NF-&#x003ba;B activation is sufficient to promote enhanced sustained CD55 expression in monocytic cell lineages is unknown.</p><p>Biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) regulates not only calcium homeostasis, but also the immune functions of defense and self-tolerance <xref rid="pone.0049318-Verstuyf1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In response to LPS, monocytic cells likely contribute to the local production of 1,25-D3 at sites of inflammation and 1,25-D3 activates an antimicrobial pathway in human macrophages <xref rid="pone.0049318-Yuk1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Moreover, direct and indirect effects of local 1,25-D3 production at the site of inflammation is implicated in the promotion of anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory processes necessary for resolution of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0049318-Verstuyf1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The anti-inflammatory properties of 1,25-D3 in monocytic lineages are due, in part, to an 1,25-D3-dependent modulation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling components that reduce the level of NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref rid="pone.0049318-CohenLahav1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The immunomodulatory effects of 1,25-D3 on CD55 expression in monocytic cells is unknown.

We show that 1,25-D3 pre-treatment differentially regulated the LPS-induced temporal expression patterns of all three molecules. 1,25-D3 pretreatment altered the LPS-induced expression of CD55 from a transient to a sustained increase and we provide compelling evidence that LPS-induced expression of CD55 is functionally dependent on NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Thus, 1,25-D3 influences monocytic response to pro-inflammatory mediators, such as LPS, by an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activation of the complement regulatory protein CD55. These findings strongly support the notion that the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway directly promotes an anti-inflammatory response by limiting complement activation. Our systematic studies also demonstrate that 1,25-D3 influences the LPS-induced expression of CD14 and CD11b and that post-transcriptional mechanisms are likely to play an important regulatory role in modulating their steady state levels.</p><p>These findings have special significance because they suggest a direct molecular integration of the complement and vitamin D3 hormonal systems, both of which are linked to chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, gestational infection and pregnancy outcomes. This may be particularly important when considering health disparities and the high rates of preterm births in blacks, a population that exhibits reduced circulating vitamin D levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>THP-1 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). They were cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/l glucose, 10 U/ml penicillin/10 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin and 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml Plasmocin (InvivoGen, San Diego CA) in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% humidity. All cells were mycoplasma free and the culture media tested negative for endotoxins using the Pyrotell Limulus Amebocyte lysate test (Associates of Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth, MA). For time course studies, a single pool of cells was resuspended in fresh media containing vehicle (0.01% ethanol) or 100 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Calbiochem). To minimize media exhaustion, 0.5 million cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes in a total volume of 8 ml. After 72 h, 100 &#x000b5;l of fresh media containing vehicle (0.1% PBS) or Escherichia coli-derived LPS (0111.B4, Sigma) was added to the cells to a final LPS concentration of 1 &#x000b5;g/ml. Following incubation, adherent and nonadherent cells were harvested after mechanically dislodging any that had attached to the culture dish. Cells were divided in half and concentrated by centrifugation. For mRNA studies, one of the cell pellets was immediately solubilized in RNA lysis solution (RNA easy Plus, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and RNA was purified following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The matching pellet was washed once in PBS containing a Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) as recommended by the manufacturer, and reconcentrated. The cell pellet was then either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C, or immediately solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. When the cumulative culture times were 96 h or less, 4.0 million cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes in a total volume of 8 ml. For the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition studies 1,25-D3-primed cells were treated with either 50 &#x000b5;M MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or 30 &#x000b5;M parthenolide (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) for 1 h prior to LPS challenge and harvested as described above after an additional 2 h or 24 h incubation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>mRNA Pool Size Quantification</title><p>For mRNA pool size determinations, total RNA (600 ng in 25 &#x000b5;l) was reverse transcribed using a mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers (qScript, Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersbury MD) and following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. mRNA pool sizes were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) using the PerfectaCTa SYBR Green Fastmix system (Quanta Biosciences). Forty (or 45, when determining CD14 levels) amplification cycles (15 s at 95&#x000b0;C and 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C) were used. The reaction mixture contained 1.5 &#x000b5;l (or 1.5 &#x000b5;l of a 1&#x02236;500 dilution for 18S rRNA determination) of reverse transcribed RNA in a 20 &#x000b5;l reaction volume. PCR efficiencies and relative copy numbers were determined using the absolute standard curve method. All qPCR mRNA primers were empirically designed using VectorNTI v5.0.3 software (InforMax, Inc., Grand Island, NY) and were mRNA specific. No detectable products were generated after a 40 cycles PCR reaction containing 150,000 copies of genomic DNA. The primer sets were: CD55, f5&#x02032;-ACCAAATGCTCAAGCAACACGGAG and r5&#x02032;-TACTACGCTCCCAAGCAAACCTGT; CD14, f5&#x02032;&#x02032;- <named-content content-type="gene">GGGACTTGGATTTGGTGGCA</named-content> and r5&#x02032;-CTTCGGCTGCCTCTTATATCCC; CD11b f5&#x02032;- <named-content content-type="gene">GTGAAGCCAATAACGCAGC</named-content> and r5&#x02032;-CTCCCATCCGTGATGACAAC; and 18s rRNA, f5&#x02032;-CGGACAGGATTGACAGATTGATAGC and r5&#x02032;-TGCCAGAGTCTCGTTCGTTATCG. All primers sets were visually tested for specificity and their products cloned and sequenced. All PCR efficiencies were &#x0003e;93%.

Following removal of media, cells were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 5 min at room temperature and then stored at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 h. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with blocking buffer (LI-COR). Primary antibodies (1&#x02236;250 in blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20) were incubated with cells overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were counter stained with Alexa Fluor 488 dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) at room temperature (1&#x02236;500 dilution in blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h.

The cooled mixtures were sonicated and insoluble material was pelleted. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The amount of whole cell extracted protein resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE was typically 50 or 100 &#x000b5;g. Prior to transfer onto an Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (Millipore), the gel was equilibrated with two changes of transfer buffer (48 mM Tris, pH 9.2, 39 mM glycine, 0.05% SDS). Transfer was performed in the cold overnight at 25 mV. The membrane was rinsed twice with PBS prior to blocking using LiCor blocking buffer. All primary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA) or R&#x00026;D Systems in Minneapolis, MN (antibodies designated MAB). Incubations were performed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the inclusion of 0.1% Tween 20. Each antibody was tested individually and non-specific binding was minimal at the following dilutions: rabbit polyclonal against CD55 (SC-9156, 1&#x02236;400 dilution); goat anti-actin (SC-1615, 1&#x02236;10,000 dilution); and mouse monoclonal antibodies against CD11b (MAB16992, 1&#x02236;250 dilution) and CD14 (MAB3831, 1&#x02236;100 dilution). Secondary IRDye labeled antibodies raised in donkey (LI-COR Biosciences) were diluted in 1&#x02236;1 LiCor blocking/PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and staining was performed for 1 h. The IRDye 680 Ab (1&#x02236;10,000 dilution) was used to detect &#x003b2;-actin, whereas CD55, CD14 and CD11b were detected with IRDye 800CW (1&#x02236;5,000 dilution). The scan setting was at a 186 &#x000b5;m resolution with the intensity for the 700 channel set to 4.0 and the 800 channel at 6.5.

Effects on CD14 and CD11b were also examined. Quantitative real time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049318-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) demonstrated a rapid and robust increase in CD14 and CD11b mRNA pool sizes.

Previous reports using FACS analysis to quantify 1,25-D3-induced expression of CD14 and CD11b in THP-1 cells have shown that CD14 protein levels markedly increased within 6 h of 1,25-D3 treatment <xref rid="pone.0049318-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and after 72 h the reported overall increase in protein expression of CD14 and CD11b (&#x0003e;60- and 10-fold, respectively, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Moeenrezakhanlou2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>) are consistent with the increased mRNA pool sizes seen here. These data suggest that 1,25-D3-induced early phase responses do not affect the constitutive transcriptional activity of the CD55 promoter. The modest increase in CD55 expression at 48 and 72 h following addition of 1,25-D3 is likely due to 1,25-D3-mediated changes in specific intracellular and/or autocrine signaling pathways or alterations in the nucleoprotein transcriptional machinery within the regulatory regions of the CD55 gene or both.</p><fig id="pone-0049318-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0049318.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CD55 mRNA and protein expression was not altered during the early response phase (0&#x02013;24 h) following a 1,25-D3 preincubation period of 72 h with human THP-1 monocytes.</title><p>THP-1 cells were cultured in complete media in the absence or presence of 100 nM 1,25-D3 (added at time&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0) and harvested at the indicated times.

Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, our studies provide the first evidence that 1,25-D3 may modulate an anti-inflammatory response in human monocytic cell lineages by promoting a sustained NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activation of an anti-inflammatory target gene. This contrasts with recent studies suggesting that the immunosuppressive action of 1,25-D3 in human monocytic lineages is directed, in part, by elevating the levels and enhancing the stability of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0049318-CohenLahav1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and/or suppressing RelB expression <xref rid="pone.0049318-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and underscores the pleiotrophic immunosuppressive effects of 1,25-D3 <xref rid="pone.0049318-Verstuyf1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Our data also suggest that 1,25-D3 indirectly modulates the transcriptional responsiveness of the CD55 promoter to LPS stimulation. We show that 1,25-D3 had no direct effect on the constitutive levels of CD55 expression within the first 24&#x02013;48 h of treatment. However, during the later stages of exposure (72 h) mRNA and protein pools increased modestly by less than 2-fold. This increase in expression could be influenced by the recruitment of transcriptional regulators, such as C/EBP&#x003b2; and MEF2D, whose expression are increased during the later stages of monocytic maturation <xref rid="pone.0049318-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and/or by DNA and chromatin modifications within the CD55 promoter/enhancer regions <xref rid="pone.0049318-Klug1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. These potential modifications to the transcriptional machinery of the CD55 gene could imprint NF-&#x003ba;B responsiveness. For example, in the context of 1,25-D3-induced changes in signaling networks and transcriptional regulators, this imprinting could block the attenuation of the transcriptional activation properties of NF-&#x003ba;B family members and/or enable NF-&#x003ba;B family members to initiate changes in the combination and/or modification state of transcriptional regulators, thereby increasing the production of CD55 mRNA&#x02019;s. Additionally, enhanced expression of the LPS-binding proteins CD14 and complement receptor 3, both of which have been shown to influence the repertoire of LPS-inducible genes in mice macrophages <xref rid="pone.0049318-Perera1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, may modulate LPS-signaling pathways and contribute to the promotion of sustained NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent CD55 expression.</p><p>The observed partial inhibitory effect of MG132 (a proteosomal inhibitor that blocks NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation by inhibiting I&#x003ba;B degradation) on LPS-induced CD55 expression suggests that additional non-NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional regulators modulate CD55 expression. LPS-signaling in monocytic lineages is known to stimulate the MAPK pathway with subsequent activation of CREB <xref rid="pone.0049318-Mellett1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, a known transcriptional activator of CD55 in epithelial cell lines <xref rid="pone.0049318-Holla1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Alternatively, activation of MAPK signaling initiated by other LPS sensing receptors, such as the G-protein coupled chemokine receptor 4 <xref rid="pone.0049318-Triantafilou1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, could contribute to the modulation of CD55 expression. In contrast, parthenolide appeared to completely block the ability of LPS to influence CD55 mRNA pool size. Parthenolide was initially characterized as an anti-inflammatory agent that inhibited NF-&#x003ba;B activation by specifically binding to and inactivating I&#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0049318-Kwok1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>; however, its specificity towards protein kinases has not been established. A more global inhibitory effect of parthenolide on cellular kinase activities, in particular those associated with the aforementioned alternative LPS-signaling pathways, would account for the more complete inhibition of LPS-induced CD55 expression. The direct correlation between mRNA pool size and CD55 protein expression levels suggest that the overall protein expression levels are not overtly influenced by post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p><p>The THP-1 cell line has been shown to be a reasonably accurate cell culture model system to explore monocytic-dependent immune responses <xref rid="pone.0049318-Sharif1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and appears to be well suited to study regulated expression of CD55. CD55 is expressed at potentially physiological relevant levels under normal growth conditions and the observed fold-induction is consistent with studies using endothelial and leukocytic primary cell cultures <xref rid="pone.0049318-Christmas1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. We are currently investigating the interrelationship between 1,25-D3 and LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B signaling on sustained CD55 expression using normal human monocytes and on the identification of functional NF-&#x003ba;B recognition elements within the CD55 promoter region to test the effects of 1,25-D3 pretreatment on the dynamics of NF-&#x003ba;B family member binding.</p><p>During the course of these studies we also investigated the expression patterns of CD14 and CD11b, as they contribute to the sensitivity and coordinated inflammatory response of pathogen surveillance and in the phagocytosis of opsonized and non-opsonised particles during wound healing <xref rid="pone.0049318-Sendide1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Dobrovolskaia1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Ehlers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. While the major thrust of our work was to investigate the regulated expression of CD55, we uncovered unanticipated features of CD14 and CD11b that are worth noting. First, as expected, both LPS and 1,25-D3 induced increases in CD14 and CD11b and the increase in mRNA pools correlated qualitatively with the protein expression shown herein and with previously reported flow cytometry analyses <xref rid="pone.0049318-Moeenrezakhanlou2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, following 1,25-D3 pretreatment, LPS promoted a coordinated control mechanism that differentially regulated CD14 and CD11b mRNA and protein pools. In 1,25-D3 pretreated THP-1 cells, the mRNA pools for CD14 transiently increased less than 2-fold during the first 24 h of stimulation. However, protein levels continuously increased and were elevated over 21-fold after 72 h of LPS exposure. On the other hand, following LPS challenge, the mRNA pools of CD11b were reduced 2-fold, whereas protein pools transiently decreased but returned by 4 h to pre-treatment levels. While a mechanistic appreciation of these findings require further studies, post-transcriptional regulation is a key feature in monocytic responses, and systems such PI3K-AKT-mTOR <xref rid="pone.0049318-Weichhart1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and/or microRNA/miRISC <xref rid="pone.0049318-ElGazzar1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Androulidaki1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> may play a role in the regulated expression of CD14 and CD11b. Additionally, the observed rapid fluctuation in CD11b protein pools following LPS challenge could reflect modulation of an intracellular protein pool and/or a rapid initialization and degradation of cell surface CR3. Additionally, we demonstrated that the 26S proteosomal inhibitor MG132 enhanced protein pools of CD11b, suggesting that the steady state levels of CD11b are modulated, in part, by the 26S proteosomal degradation pathway. Rapid targeting of phagocytosed particles to the 26S proteosomal system is consistent with its role in antigen presentation by monocytic cell lineages <xref rid="pone.0049318-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Rock1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The ability of the cell to rapidly modulate steady state CD11b levels may also have important roles in modulating leukocyte adhesion and trafficking during the early stages of an inflammatory insult <xref rid="pone.0049318-Ehlers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and in the modulation of innate immune pro-inflammatory response <xref rid="pone.0049318-Dobrovolskaia1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that 1,25-D3 influences monocytic responses to pro-inflammatory mediators, such as LPS, by an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activation of the complement regulatory protein CD55. Our studies provide the first evidence that 1,25-D3 may modulate an anti-inflammatory response in monocytic cell lineages by promoting a sustained NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activation of anti-inflammatory target gene. Our data support the notion that the interrelationship between the vitamin D3 and complement systems should be explored in the pathophysiology of many human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases <xref rid="pone.0049318-Holers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049318-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> and the pathophysiology of allograft rejection <xref rid="pone.0049318-Wuding1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0049318-Shibata1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The elevated and sustained expression profile mimics our recent findings on the expression profile of peripheral leukocyte CD55 in patients that exhibited PTL but did not progress to preterm delivery <xref rid="pone.0049318-Pacheco1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. While the polarization and activation of monocyte cell lineages are complex processes influenced by the vitamin D3 hormonal system and by the spatial and temporal cascade of cytokine and chemokine induced signaling events, our study lends support to the notion that the vitamin D3 hormonal system may play a role in the pathophysiology of preterm labor. This may be particularly important when considering health disparity and the high rates of preterm births in African Americans, a population that exhibits reduced circulating vitamin D levels <xref rid="pone.0049318-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Diana Marver for her thoughtful critical comments during the preparation of this manuscript.
