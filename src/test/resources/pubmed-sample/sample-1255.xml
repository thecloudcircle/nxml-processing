To investigate the relationship between those cardiovascular responses and the activation of nociceptive afferents, we analyzed BP and HR responses to electrical stimulations at each DCN from T6 to L1 at 0.5&#x02009;mA to activate A-fiber alone or 5&#x02009;mA to activate both A- and C-fibers at different frequencies. Evoked cardiovascular responses showed a decrease and then an increase in BP and an increase and then a plateau in HR. Segmentally, both cardiovascular responses tended to be larger when evoked from the more rostral DCNs. Stimulation frequency had a larger effect on cardiovascular responses than the rostrocaudal level of the DCN input. Stimulation strength showed a large effect on BP changes dependent on C-fibers whereas HR changes were dependent on A-fibers. Additional A-fiber activation by stimulating up to 4 adjacent DCNs concurrently, but only at 0.5&#x02009;mA, affected HR but not BP. These data support that cutaneous nociceptive afferent subtypes preferentially contribute to different cardiovascular responses, A-fibers to HR and C-fibers to BP, with temporal (stimulation frequency) and spatial (rostrocaudal level) dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Sensory processing</kwd><kwd>Neurophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense (United States Department of Defense)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-10-1-0971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tansey</surname><given-names>Keith E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The relationship between pain and a closely following autonomic response is well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Activation of visceral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, muscular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and cutaneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> pain reflexes all produce measurable autonomic responses. More recently, it has even been proposed that the nociceptive and autonomic systems are two parts of an interoceptive system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Autonomic responses to nociceptive input encompass a wide range of behaviors, including bladder function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, gastric motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and cardiovascular responses. Aside from the well-known examples of the importance of blood pressure (BP) in many pathologies e.g. cardiovascular disease, BP is also important in its relationship with nociception, such as in autonomic dysreflexia where a noxious sensory input below the severe high thoracic or cervical spinal cord injury can cause life threatening, episodic increases in BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The effects of noxious stimuli on BP and heart rate (HR) have been compared by natural and electrical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, muscle/cutaneous/visceral afferents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, stimulation frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, stimulation strengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, anesthetic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, body temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and spinal-segment specific activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Although these previous studies have extensively investigated those stimulation parameters separately, their interactions are not clear, nor do we know the comparative efficacy in producing cardiovascular responses among those stimulation parameters. For instance, in spinal cord injury, a better physiological understanding what nociceptive afferent subtypes, how much, and activated in what frequency are necessary to produce autonomic dysreflexia would be interesting in addition to important clinical questions related to the segmental differences (rostral or caudal to the level of injury).</p><p id="Par4">Noxious input can concurrently evoke motor and autonomic responses. The spinal neural circuits for both nociception and the autonomic nervous system share input from the periaqueductal grey via the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brainstem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and the two systems are integrated at the brainstem level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, the close relationship between nociceptive afferent activation and autonomic regulations represent a gap in our current understanding of neurophysiology.</p><p id="Par5">The cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM) reflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> provides a good model system to study both nociceptive-motor reflexes and nociceptive-cardiovascular responses from the same noxious stimuli. The CTM reflex is a relatively simple intersegmental cutaneous nociceptive reflex circuit in non-primate mammals which has been used to study functional recovery of cross-injury circuits in animal spinal cord injury models of the guinea pig<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In larger mammals, like dogs and horses, the CTM reflex is called the panniculus reflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The reflex is mediated by a polysynaptic circuit (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), consisting of: (1) primary afferents in segmental dorsal cutaneous nerves (DCNs) from lumbar to thoracic levels, (2) propriospinal interneurons, and (3) the CTM motoneuron pool from C7 to T1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The CTM reflex responses are known to be nociceptive specific in the rat generating two timely separate phases: an early phase supposed to be mediated by A-fibers (particularly A&#x003b4;) and a late phase mediated by C-fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Previous studies were able to activate these afferent populations depending on stimulation strengths using a low stimulation strength for the early phase alone and a high stimulation&#x000a0;strength for both early and late phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In our previous reports, the activation of DCNs at various stimulation frequencies at different spinal segmental levels demonstrated the temporal and spatial dynamics of the CTM reflex responses respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. DCN A- and C-fibers selectively labeled with axon-specific transganglionic tracers at different thoracic (T7 vs T13) levels also demonstrated that central projection patterns of those nociceptive fibers and their synaptic terminations contributed to the somatotopic (i.e. spinal segmental) organization of DCN-evoked CTM reflex responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cutaneus trunci muscle reflex and nociceptive-autonomic neural connection diagram.

In this study, BP responses were recorded in responses to DCN stimulations and HR responses were calculated from the pulse pressure fluctuations of BP response recordings in rats (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of the nociceptive cardiovascular responses, we first analyzed BP and HR responses evoked by DCN stimulations at different spinal segmental levels at different frequencies. We also compared those cardiovascular responses evoked with single DCN stimulation at different stimulation strengths (A-fiber alone vs A- and C-fibers) or with multiple DCN stimulation only at A-fiber strength (additional recruitment of A-fiber alone from different DCNs) to investigate whether DCN afferent subtypes produce differential cardiovascular responses (BP vs HR).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Processing of blood pressure trace to get heart rate.

The HR vs BP space demonstrated several trends based on DCN segment and stimulation frequency. First, the drop in BP appeared to precede the rise in HR. BP would then rise and HR then fall, often slightly to below baseline levels. While many of the rostrocaudal changes in HR or BP were not as impressive when HR or BP were examined independently (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), differences in the overall qualitative paths of the BP-HR relationships were notable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

After stimulation terminated (20&#x02009;seconds), the BP generally dropped slightly (BP-Post phase), in proportion to the size of the rise.

DCNs, like all other cutaneous nerves, contain large diameter myelinated A-&#x003b1; and A-&#x003b2; fibers (~30&#x02013;80), smaller diameter myelinated A-&#x003b4; fibers (~150&#x02013;260), and unmyelinated C-fibers (~1500&#x02013;2700), based on our lab&#x02019;s previous anatomical quantification of those peripheral nerves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These afferent fiber types are alternatively referred to as Group I/II fibers, Group III fibers, and Group IV fibers respectively. While DCNs have all subtypes of myelinated fibers, CTM reflex neurograms were not able to differentiate what proportion of which myelinated fiber population was stimulated due to how short the DCNs are in the rat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. As previous works have found, the rat CTM reflex was insensitive to the activation of low-threshold A-&#x003b1; or A-&#x003b2; fibers although it was sufficient to generate compound action potentials in DCNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

Therefore, both the CTM reflex and the BP/HR responses depend on activation of smaller diameter myelinated A-fibers and unmyelinated C-fibers.</p><p id="Par25">Historically, systemic BP output to afferent stimulation has been controversial between depressor and pressor depending on types of nerve stimulated (muscle vs cutaneous), stimulation strengths (only A-fiber vs A- and C-fibers), and stimulation frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Despite of the controversy, these reports consistently demonstrated that primary afferent stimulation produced BP pressor only when both A- and C-fibers were activated at high stimulation frequency over 10&#x02009;Hz which explains why we observed only depressor at given stimulation frequency up to 10&#x02009;Hz. We found that moving from A-fiber-only stimulation (0.5&#x02009;mA) to A- and C-fiber stimulation (5&#x02009;mA) resulted in a significantly larger depressor response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). This result might be due to an increased recruitment of smaller myelinated fibers leading to a larger depressor response as opposed to the addition of unmyelinated afferent activation. However, the activation of additional myelinated A-fibers in multiple DCNs at low stimulation strength was much less effective on the BP response changes than was the activation of both A- and C-fibers in a single DCN at high stimulation strength (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> vs 4A). Although A-fibers alone can elicit small BP depressor, particularly in combination with higher frequencies, C-fibers play a major role in producing the early depressor responses in the cutaneous-autonomic system.</p><p id="Par26">The late pressor response is less clear whether A- or C-fibers were actively involved in this response. It was also dependent on stimulation strength and stimulation frequency as was the early depressor. Based, however, on the symmetrical appearance of the late pressor following the early depressor mediated by A-fibers at 0.5&#x02009;mA stimulation strength in single (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>) and multiple (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>) DCN stimulation, C-fibers were not required in the late pressor response. This remains only A-fibers as a candidate. As it has been known that C-fiber mediated responses were generally slower and longer than A-fiber mediated responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, however, it is less convincible that A-fiber activation directly produced such a late response about 9&#x02009;seconds after the stimulation train. Therefore, we speculate that the late BP increase is a result of either a passive recovery from the BP decrease, the early HR increase by means of A-fiber activation, or active neural process in a longer neural pathways e.g. the somato-sympathetic brainstem pathways.</p><p id="Par27">In contrast to BP, HR response differences were nearly independent of stimulation strength (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), relying predominantly on the stimulation frequency at 5&#x02009;mA stimulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As the A-fiber-only stimulation strength produced similar HR increases as A- and C-fiber activation, HR-Rise was mostly a result of A-fiber activation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In addition, the activation of additional A-fibers in multiple DCN stimulation strongly correlated with the size of HR-Rise but not with BP-Drop (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Taken all together, these data support the idea that A-fibers preferably contribute to HR and small BP depressor in stimulation-frequency-dependent manner while C-fibers exclusively contribute to BP depressor in normal animals. It might be relevant to study whether pathological autonomic reflexes, such as autonomic dysreflexia after spinal cord injury, show differential dependence on A-fiber and C-fiber sensory afferent inputs.</p><p id="Par28">Stimulation frequency had generally the greatest effect among the stimulation parameters on both the BP-Rise and HR-Rise phases (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). BP-Drop at 0.5&#x02009;mA at 10&#x02009;Hz stimulation reached the extent of which BP decreased at 5&#x02009;mA at 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This suggests that A-fiber mediated BP-Drop requires relatively high stimulation frequency, at least, 10&#x02009;Hz to make a sufficient BP change as C-fibers did. Indeed, BP responses at 0.5&#x02009;mA significantly correlated to stimulation frequencies at the caudal level only when the data at 10&#x02009;Hz stimulation was included (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). In addition, the stimulation of the maximal early BP-Drop phase at 5&#x02009;mA was less consistent, sometimes observed at 2&#x02009;Hz, and sometimes at 5&#x02009;Hz, depending on the rostrocaudal location of the stimulated DCN (bottom panels, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Our data included both HR changes and BP changes, so it is natural to question whether the causation is nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;BP&#x02192;&#x02009;HR, nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;HR&#x02192;&#x02009;BP, or nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;BP/nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;HR (independent of one another). From the perspective of time delays, the initial BP-Drop phase in the study happened before the HR increase, as can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, which makes nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;HR&#x02192;&#x02009;BP unlikely. The parasympathetic BP&#x02192;&#x02009;HR baroreflex is known to be substantially attenuated by cutaneous nociception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. HR responses from various forms of cutaneous nociceptive stimulation were insensitive to whether the vagus nerve was intact or not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, there is also a purely sympathetic BP&#x02192;&#x02009;HR baroreflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, which is still intact. Therefore, while we find it to be a less likely explanation, we cannot entirely dispute a BP&#x02192;&#x02009;HR interaction.</p><p id="Par32">The results showed a divergence between early HR and BP responses in their activation and sensitivity to the stimulation frequency, as HR-Rise was exclusively activated by A-fibers and sensitive to frequency, while BP drops were activated by A-fibers in lesser extent in stimulation-frequency-dependent manner or by C-fibers in greater extent, and sensitive to stimulation-frequency as well. This divergence in activation and sensitivity supports parallel nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;BP/nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;HR pathways during nociceptive input. Other researchers have also reported similar cases of divergence between changes in HR and BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, we propose that during the early stimulation, the parallel nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;BP/nociception&#x02192;&#x02009;HR pathway dominates. Our ongoing studies in rats with high thoracic transection spinal cord injury that disconnects the brainstem pathways would elucidate whether the sympathetic baroreflex is involved in HR responses evoked by the cutaneous nociception. In addition, we will also be able to investigate what changes (A- vs C-fibers, BP vs HR) are responsible for the development of autonomic dysreflexia after that injury.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par33">All animal procedures were conducted with the approval of the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.

The anterior neck and the back were shaved, and body temperature was maintained at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C using a warming pad regulated by a feedback controller with a rectal probe (Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ) during the rest of surgical and recording procedures. The back skin was incised along the midline from near the base of the skull to the iliac crest, and the left DCNs from L1 to T6 were isolated from underlying fascia and cut distally. The anterior neck skin was incised, and the right carotid artery was exposed and freed from surrounding tissues. Care was taken to avoid injury to the vagus nerve during surgery and while the right carotid artery was cannulated and connected to a BP transducer (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) using PE 10 tubing filled with heparinized saline (2% heparin). The rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments Inc.) to maintain the position of the rat, PE tubing, and electrodes and all exposed tissues were bathed in warm mineral oil. A DCN was placed on a bipolar stimulating electrode at a time (single DCN stimulation, see below) or multiple DCNs were placed on up to 4 electrodes simultaneously (multiple DCN stimulation, see below). Pentobarbital supplement (10% of the initial dose) was given intraperitoneally to maintain anesthetic level as needed (approximately hourly), where need was judged by the reemergence of the flexor reflex to paw pinch or the eye blink reflex. To avoid clotting in the PE 10 tubing, as detected by dampened pressure waves, the tubing was flushed occasionally during rest between stimulation epochs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Single DCN stimulation</title><p id="Par35">A single segmental DCN from L1 to T6 was placed on a bipolar electrode connected to a stimulus isolator (ISO-Flex, A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) driven by a pulse stimulator (Master-8, A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel). Each DCN was stimulated at either 0.5&#x02009;mA or 5&#x02009;mA stimulation strength (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8 at each strength, totaling n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) with pulse widths of 250 &#x000b5;s at different frequencies (1, 2, 5, and 10&#x02009;Hz) for 20&#x02009;seconds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although the fixed stimulation train time yields different stimulation numbers (20, 40, 100, 200 stimulations by given frequencies respectively), this ensures activation of cardiovascular responses which show a relatively long onset-to-peak latency (generally 9&#x02009;seconds for BP and HR, see below &#x02018;Blood Pressure Recording and Heart Rate Calculation&#x02019; and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The separation of 5&#x02009;mA and 0.5&#x02009;mA animals was required due to the consistent duration of the protocol after the initial pentobarbital injection. Single DCNs were stimulated in a caudal-to-rostral order (L1&#x02013;T6) completing all stimulation frequencies at each DCN in order from lowest frequency to highest frequency to reduce possible habituation effects before moving on to the next DCN. A stimulation epoch lasting 20&#x02009;seconds was started every 2&#x02009;minutes, allowing the animal to rest for a sufficient amount of time for the BP and HR to return to baseline values before the next stimulation epoch began. The stimulation amplitudes were chosen based on empirical testing of the nociceptive-motor responses with only the early (A-fiber-dependent) phase of the CTM reflex evident at 0.5&#x02009;mA, while 5&#x02009;mA was consistently capable of maximally eliciting both the early and the ate (C-fiber-dependent) phases of the CTM reflex. This distinction (i.e. early phase of the CTM reflex being A-fiber-dependent and the late phase being C-fiber-dependent) is supported by previous work on the reflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In general, 3&#x02009;mA stimulation was sufficient to produce the full late phase of the CTM reflex, but we used 5&#x02009;mA to make sure we recruited the entire population of C-fibers even in DCNs with more neurovascular bundle tissue. Higher stimulation strengths or longer stimulation pulse widths failed to generate any further increases in the maximum CTM response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Multiple DCN stimulation</title><p id="Par36">An additional group of rats (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) were subjected to the surgical procedure described above and used for multiple DCN stimulations. A single DCN at a caudal (T13) level was placed on a stimulating electrode and stimulated at different stimulation frequencies (1, 2, 5, and 10&#x02009;Hz) for 20&#x02009;seconds but only at 0.5&#x02009;mA (A-fiber-dependent). An adjacent DCN branch was then placed on an additional electrode with a separate stimulus isolator and the stimulation trains were repeated simultaneously. Ultimately, up to 4 DCNs were added incrementally in the order of T13, T13&#x02009;+&#x02009;T12, T13&#x02009;+&#x02009;T12&#x02009;+&#x02009;L1, and T13&#x02009;+&#x02009;T12&#x02009;+&#x02009;L1&#x02009;+&#x02009;T11. This was repeated at a rostral level starting at T7 in the order of T7, T7&#x02009;+&#x02009;T8, T7&#x02009;+&#x02009;T8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T6, and T7&#x02009;+&#x02009;T8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T6&#x02009;+&#x02009;T9. Consistent with the single DCN stimulation protocol, all stimulation frequencies at each DCN combination were started every 2&#x02009;minutes in the order from lowest frequency to highest frequency before adding the next DCN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Blood pressure recording and heart rate derivation</title><p id="Par37">The BP was continuously recorded during the entire stimulation protocol on a data acquisition board (USB 6259 BNC, National Instruments, Austin, TX) at a 10,000&#x02009;Hz sampling rate. The stimulation from the stimulator was also registered in the recording file to locate each stimulation. The continuous recording data was transformed and processed in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). The BP signal was minimally filtered with a 100&#x02009;Hz low-pass Butterworth filter, then converted to millimeter of mercury (mmHg) and cut from 10&#x02009;seconds before each stimulus train to 20&#x02009;seconds after the end of each stimulus train totaling 50&#x02009;seconds.</p><p id="Par38">The HR signal was calculated in beat per minute (bpm) from the pulse pressure fluctuations in the BP signal. A Butterworth band-pass filter (3&#x02013;12&#x02009;Hz, 180&#x02013;720 bpm) was applied to the BP data, then the power spectral density was calculated using the periodogram method in Matlab and sampled at 0.5&#x02009;Hz. The output showed the HR changes over time from DCN stimulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). An artifact rejection algorithm was then applied where the HR data with large (&#x0003e;10%) deviations from the local median value within 4&#x02009;seconds (&#x000b1;2&#x02009;seconds) were replaced with local 2<sup>nd</sup>-order polynomial fits to the data.</p><p id="Par39">For the purposes of both qualitative inspection and statistics, the cardiovascular responses from single DCN stimulation were time-windowed into specific phases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For both BP and HR, the signals were split into three phases, chosen based on the timing of qualitative differences in how the autonomic signals responded to the stimulus. The three phases: BP-Drop or HR-Rise, for 9&#x02009;seconds from the stimulus train onset (0&#x02013;9&#x02009;seconds), BP-Rise or HR-Hold, for 11&#x02009;seconds after the first 9&#x02009;seconds to the end of the stimulus train (9&#x02013;20&#x02009;seconds), and BP-Post or HR-Post, for 18&#x02009;seconds from the end of stimulation (20&#x02013;38&#x02009;seconds). Although we collected data for 20&#x02009;seconds post stimulation train, the last time window included 18&#x02009;seconds in order to allow the BP response to be filtered for artifacts (described above). In each of these phases, the averaged change per second (&#x02206;/sec) was calculated. For the comprehensive comparison of the cardiovascular responses from multiple DCN stimulation, the maximal change was calculated over the time period across all time windows (0&#x02013;38&#x02009;seconds).</p><p id="Par40">To relate temporal traces of HR and BP in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, BP and HR values that started at slightly different baseline levels in each animal were normalized by averaged value for 10&#x02009;seconds before the stimulation onsets. This approach has the advantage of being robust against different animal-to-animal differences and plotting different group means across frequencies, levels, and stimulation strengths consistently at the same baseline (1, 1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical comparisons</title><p id="Par41">In cases where two groupings were compared, the Student T-Test was used to establish significance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In groupings where more than two values were compared, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to establish significance, setting up the test to determine if the entire group came from the same probability distribution (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In addition to the significance, to get a better estimation of how big an effect was, Cohen&#x02019;s D was used to measure effect sizes where results were significantly different at a confidence level of 99% or more. In cases with more than two conditions to compare, the Cohen&#x02019;s D was calculated between the conditions with the largest and smallest mean value. Following standard interpretation for Cohen&#x02019;s D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, a small effect is noted at &#x0003e;0.2, a medium effect at &#x0003e;0.5, and a large effect at &#x0003e;0.8. A Cohen&#x02019;s D of &#x0003e;1.1 is a very large effect size. For multiple DCN stimulation, we focused the correlational analysis on changes of different cardiovascular responses, BP and HR, with the number of DCNs stimulated. The maximal changes across all phases were used in order to calculate correlation coefficients (Pearson&#x02019;s Correlation) of BP and HR responses against either the number of DCNs or the stimulation frequency using &#x0201c;corrcoef&#x0201d; function (Matlab). Significance was indicated above the correlation coefficients. In all figures, error bars represent standard deviation. Significance was generally shown at either &#x0003e;95% (*), &#x0003e;99% (**) or &#x0003e;99.9% (***) of the groups being different.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>These authors contributed equally: Hyun Joon Lee and Jason M.
