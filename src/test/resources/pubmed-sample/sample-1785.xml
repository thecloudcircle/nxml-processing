However, the effortful nature of many forms of ER may lead to regulation being inefficient and potentially ineffective. The present research examined whether structured practice could increase the efficiency of ER. During three training sessions, comprising a total of 150 training trials, participants were presented with negatively valenced images and asked either to &#x0201c;attend&#x0201d; (control condition) or &#x0201c;reappraise&#x0201d; (ER condition). A further group of participants did not participate in training but only completed follow-up measures. Practice increased the efficiency of ER as indexed by decreased time required to regulate emotions and increased heart rate variability (HRV). Furthermore, participants in the ER condition spontaneously regulated their negative emotions two weeks later and reported being more habitual in their use of ER. These findings indicate that structured practice can facilitate the automatic control of negative emotions and that these effects persist beyond training.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>

ER can lead to changes in the valence, intensity, time course and approach&#x02013;avoidance tendencies associated with the activated emotion (Koole, <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Webb, Miles, &#x00026; Sheeran, <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and can influence attention (Amir, Beard, Burns, &#x00026; Bomyea, <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), appraisal (Gross, <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) and physiological responses, like heart rate (Denson, Grisham, &#x00026; Moulds, <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). ER is typically portrayed as a strenuous process (Koole, <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) that aims to modulate spontaneous emotional responses (Duckworth, Bargh, Garcia, &#x00026; Chaiken, <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Evidence suggests that effortful processes like ER are characterised by diffuse neural activity (Jansma, Ramsey, Slagter, &#x00026; Kahn, <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Little, Klein, Shobat, McClure, &#x00026; Thulborn, <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and supported by the cardiovascular system (i.e., increases in heart rate above those predicted by somatic requirements; Kennedy &#x00026; Scholey, <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Turner &#x00026; Carroll, <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Weis, <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). It is not surprising, therefore, that effortful regulation makes extensive use of cognitive and physiological resources (Muraven, Tice, &#x00026; Baumeister, <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). For example, effortful ER compared to emotional acceptance was found to lead to poorer self-control in a subsequent stop-signal task requiring response inhibition (Alberts, Schneider, &#x00026; Martijn, <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>ER can, however, also be implemented more automatically (Gyurak, Gross, &#x00026; Etkin, <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mauss, Bunge, &#x00026; Gross, <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In contrast to effortful processes, automatic processes can be characterised by a range of features including being efficient, fast, spontaneous, stimulus driven, unconscious and relatively difficult to control. However, contemporary views suggest that these features should be investigated separately (Moors &#x00026; De Houwer, <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In the present research, we focus primarily on the efficiency of ER. Therefore, &#x0201c;automatic&#x0201d; ER is taken to mean that people downregulate an unwanted emotional state using fewer resources and therefore decreasing the need for elevated cardiac outputs. This efficiency may occur because automatic processing is associated with a better connected neural network (where less neurons are active), as opposed to the more diffuse activity that characterises effortful processes (Jansma et al., <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Little et al., <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In short, automatic processes decrease the need for elevated cardiac outputs to supply active neural structures with glucose (Kennedy &#x00026; Scholey, <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Turner &#x00026; Carroll, <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Weis, <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). This is consistent with evidence suggesting that automatic ER results in a lower heart rate when compared with effortful ER (Williams, Bargh, Nocera, &#x00026; Gray, <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0001"><title>Capitalising on the benefits of automatic ER</title><p>More automatic forms of ER are likely to enable people to exert continuous control over their emotional responses because they are less resource intensive. The potential benefits of being able to regulate emotional responses in a relatively automatic fashion raise the question of whether individuals can develop strategies to capitalise on these benefits. The present research aimed to develop relatively automatic ER through the use of structured practice, a potential mechanism through which effortful processes such as ER can become more efficient (Bargh &#x00026; Ferguson, <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gyurak et al., <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Indeed, research on cognitive bias modification has reported that structured practice increases the efficiency with which participants directed their attention away from negatively valenced material (MacLeod, Koster, &#x00026; Fox, <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, mastering a single ER process or skill, like attentional control, does not necessarily ensure proficiency in other ER processes such as monitoring the need to regulate nor does it ensure proficiency in the application of ER strategies (Walden &#x00026; Smith, <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Therefore, the present research examined the effects of training on the application of an ER strategy designed to help individuals to modify their emotional responses.</p><p>Previous research examining the effects of structured practice in reappraising negative events has produced encouraging results. For example, Schartau, Dalgleish, and Dunn (<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) trained some participants to reappraise negatively valenced film clips while another group watched the same film clips but were instructed to avoid regulating their emotions. Following training, both groups were asked to reappraise their emotional responses to further film clips. Participants who had practiced reappraisal showed lower levels of negative affect compared with those who were not trained. An additional study demonstrated that practice in reappraisal reduces the intrusion of negative memories over the subsequent week. However, Schartau et al. did not examine the impact of their intervention on physiological indicators of the efficiency of ER (e.g., cardiac responses), nor did they examine whether practice promoted efficient, habitual ER over time.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0002"><title>The present research</title><p>We investigated whether structured practice can increase the immediacy and the efficiency of ER as measured by the time taken to regulate emotions and cardiac responses. Cardiac responses were measured in terms of variability in interbeat intervals (IBIs), indexed by heart rate variability (HRV). HRV refers to the degree to which the time interval between successive heart beats fluctuates. Neurophysiological models consider HRV to be a biomarker of successful ER (Thayer &#x00026; Lane, <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and empirical studies have shown that effortful cognitive processing decreases HRV (Aasman, Mulder, &#x00026; Mulder, <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) while automatic cognitive processing increases HRV (Denson et al., <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This is in accord with literature suggesting that a decreased number of neurons are recruited after people have learned to complete a task in a more automatic fashion (Jansma et al., <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Little et al., <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Decreased neuronal activity reduces the need for cardiac acceleration (indexed by reduced HRV) in order to supply active neural populations with metabolic substrates (Kennedy &#x00026; Scholey, <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Turner &#x00026; Carroll, <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Weis, <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). The aforementioned findings suggest that increases in IBI times (and thus HRV) reflect efficient task completion (Saling &#x00026; Phillips, <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and therefore more automatic ER.</p><p>The present research asked participants to complete three training sessions over one week designed to increase the immediacy and efficiency with which they reappraised their emotional responses to images depicting body injuries (e.g., a mutilated toe). Previous research has shown that pictures depicting body injuries are associated with greater startle reflexes, as measured via blink magnitude, indicating their potency to act as aversive stimuli (Fairchild, Van Goozen, Stollery, &#x00026; Goodyer, <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). A follow-up session was conducted two weeks after the final training session. We hypothesised that training in the application of ER would result in faster ER (lower response latencies) and increased HRV during late but not early training trials, thus demonstrating both a practice effect and an increased efficiency over time. Two weeks later, we predicted that participants who had practiced using reappraisal would be more likely to spontaneously regulate their negative emotions and report being more habitual in so doing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0002"><title>METHOD</title><sec id="s0002-0001"><title>Participants and design</title><p>Thirty participants were recruited from staff and students at a large university in the UK via email and flyers.

Participants were told via written instructions that during each trial they would be presented with a series of pictures, some of which depicted scenes designed to evoke negative emotions. Participants in the ER condition were instructed to reinterpret the content of the target pictures in order to alter their emotional responses (Gross, <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) using the phrase &#x0201c;When seeing these injuries you must remind yourself that they are fake; they were created by the film industry using special effect technology to be used in movies&#x0201d;. Participants in the ER condition were told to press the &#x0201c;Enter&#x0201d; key when their emotional response to each negative image subsided. Participants in the control training condition were simply told: &#x0201c;When you see any injury, please press the &#x02018;Enter&#x02019; key&#x0201d;.</p><p>Each training session comprised of 80 trials presented in a pseudorandom order. Each trial contained a maximum of 10 images (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Thirty trials contained 10 images depicting non-injured body parts presented for one second each. The remaining 50 trials presented participants with between 0 and 9 images depicting non-injured body parts followed by a picture depicting an injury. Pictures depicting body injuries could appear at any position ranging from the first to the tenth picture in order to avoid expectancy effects. Trials in which the picture depicting an injury was presented first always followed trials that contained no picture depicting an injury. Pictures depicting body injuries remained on-screen for 10 seconds to allow sufficient time for ER and were followed by the same self-report measure as that used during baseline, which served as a measure of ER success. No stimulus was presented after the self-report item and thus the inter-trial interval was varied such that each trial lasted for 25 seconds in total.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiovascular effort exerted</title><p>HRV was collected using photoplethysmography (PPG) signal sensors attached to the left ear lobe. PPG belongs to a category of methods used to measure cardiac outputs that also includes electrocardiography (ECG) and pulse oximetry (Lu, Yang, Taylor, &#x00026; Stein, <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). To establish baseline HRV, participants were presented with a slideshow containing 30 images of neutral valence (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>Val</sub> = 5.2, SD = 0.3, possible range of responses 1&#x02013;9, 4&#x02013;6 = neutral valance) from the IAPS (Lang et al., <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Images remained on-screen for five seconds and the 30 images were repeated in a random order for five minutes. HRV was measured as the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) in the IBIs (Camm et al., <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). This time-domain measure is correlated with measures reflecting high frequency components of the respiratory range (Goedhart, Van Der Sluis, Houtveen, Willemsen, &#x00026; De Geus, <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). It therefore indicates parasympathetic influences to the heart and thus decreases in cardiac responding. The output of the PPG sensor was digitally sampled and an online Butterworth low-pass filter, with a cut-off at 7 hz, was applied to remove any high frequency noise present in the signal. Artefact pre-processing was conducted on the IBI data following Goedhart et al.&#x02019; s (<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) guidelines. Change scores were computed subtracting baseline from training HRV. Therefore, positive scores represent increases in HRV (indexing decreased cardiovascular responding).</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>During the follow-up session, two weeks after the final training session, participants watched five film clips lasting between 60 and 105 seconds presented in a pseudorandom order (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The use of film clips during the follow-up allowed us to (1) examine whether training in ER influenced more sustained emotional responses, such as those induced by film clips (Westermann, Spies, Stahl, &#x00026; Hesse, <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) that are more ecologically valid than pictures (Gross &#x00026; Levenson, <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), and (2) reduce shared method variance and the likelihood that any effects of our training paradigm are task-specific (Holmes, Lang, &#x00026; Shah, <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The film clips were obtained from Internet-based video-hosting sites and showed scenes including war violence, the infection of human tissue by fly larvae and the removal of a cyst from a person&#x02019;s back. Following each film, participants rated their current emotional state on the same 11-point Likert scale used previously. No instructions were given regarding the application of ER as we were interested in the extent to which ER could be elicited relatively automatically by negative stimuli (Posner &#x00026; Snyder, <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>).</p><p>In order to confirm that the film clips were successful in inducing negative emotions, we compared participants&#x02019; self-reported emotional state in the no-training condition before and after they were exposed to the film clips.

Participants who completed training in reappraisal showed successful downregulation of negative affect while decreasing the time needed to apply ER and the amount of cardiovascular effort invested in ER. Moreover, participants who completed training were able to regulate their (negative) emotions in the absence of explicit instructions two weeks later, indicating that negative events (in this case, being asked to watch a distressing film) now elicited ER in a spontaneous manner. Participants who completed training also reported being more habitual and automatic in their application of reappraisal. The findings of the present research are consistent with research into the effects of cognitive bias modification on ER, which suggests that structured practice can promote the effective downregulation of negative emotions after the end of an intervention (MacLeod et al., <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The findings are also consistent with those of Thiruchselvam, Hajcak, and Gross (<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) who found that cognitive strategies, like the allocation of attention to the non-arousing aspects of the presented negative stimuli, can reduce emotional responses, and more broadly, with research on the beneficial effects of reappraisal (for a review, see Webb et al., <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, the present study expands such findings beyond tasks involving attention allocation to investigate the effects of structured practice in the application of a reappraisal ER strategy. The findings of the present research support those of Schartau et al. (<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and extend them to demonstrate that practice can promote more automatic ER; an effect that was maintained two weeks later.</p><p>The use of physiological measures such as HRV that are sensitive to effort invested during ER, along with measures of the extent to which individuals regulated their emotions in a more automatic fashion (namely the SRBAI), offered insights into the relationship between structured practice in ER and the efficiency of ER. Overall, the findings showed that structured practice led to increases in HRV during ER, reflecting decreased cardiovascular effort. In turn, participants receiving structured practice reported being more habitual and automatic in their use of reappraisal during the follow-up compared with participants in the control and no-training conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest that physiological measures can be used to measure changes in the efficiency with which cognitive processes such as ER are implemented. Although physiological measures may not be practical in all contexts, they have the advantage of being non-reactive and sufficiently sensitive to changes elicited over relatively short time periods (for a review of the use of physiological measures in research on emotions, see Mauss &#x00026; Robinson, <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Practical applications</title><p>The short duration of the present intervention and the minimal need for one-to-one contact suggest that similar protocols could be implemented online or developed as part of computerised self-help packages. This kind of application could offer people a structured approach to promoting effective and efficient ER and therefore help them to gain control of problematic emotions while avoiding the drain on resources that is associated with effortful forms of ER. For example, professionals who are subjected to continued stress, such as emergency room staff (Jensen et al., <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), are likely to benefit from the increased resilience that is afforded by more automatic forms of ER. The use of effortful forms of ER under these circumstances would not permit sustained regulation of emotional responses. More automatic forms of ER, on the other hand, use fewer self-regulatory resources, thereby allowing prolonged regulation of emotional responses. Such applications of the current training paradigm are in accord with researches examining the promotion of emotional resilience. For example, Stallard et al. (<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) reported that the provision of a cognitive behavior therapy programme incorporating training in ER led to decreased anxiety measures thereby promoting emotional resilience.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0002"><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>Due to the intensity of the present research paradigm, requiring repeated training and assessment over a number of days, our sample size was relatively small (<italic>n</italic> = 27 participants, across three conditions), though comparable to those used in similar experimental designs (Schneider &#x00026; Shiffrin, <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">1977a</xref>, <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">1977b</xref>; Mahdavi-Haji, Mohammadkhani, &#x00026; Hahtami, <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Webb, Sheeran, &#x00026; Luszczynska, <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The relative small sample of the present research meant that we were unable to examine individual differences in responses to training. Future research should, however, seek to replicate the present findings among larger, more diverse samples that would allow the examination of individual differences. Given that training effects can display context sensitivity (Reder &#x00026; Klatzky, <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), subsequent research should also measure responses to real-world events in order to examine whether the effects of structured practice in ER are transferable to settings outside the laboratory. Finally, future research should examine whether structured training can aid ER using a more varied set of stimuli and instructions. Our finding that ER at follow-up was relatively habitual suggests that effects should be maintained over longer follow-up periods. However, it may also be that additional strategies or reminders are required to maintain effects over time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0005"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, the present research suggests that structured practice in the application of reappraisal can foster efficient and fast control of emotional responses. Such effects are sustained two weeks following training and become relatively more automatic. These findings are likely to hold practical implications for promoting emotional resilience for professionals who are subject to ongoing stress.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list content-type="references"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="cit0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aasman</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulder</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulder</surname><given-names>L.
