However, QT intervals are poorly defined in murine ECGs. As a consequence, several different techniques have been used to measure murine QT intervals. The present work develops a consistent measure of the murine QT interval that correlates with changes in the duration of ventricular myocyte action potentials (APs). Volume-conducted ECGs were compared with simultaneously recorded APs, obtained using floating intracellular microelectrodes in Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts. QT intervals were measured from the onset of the QRS complex. The interval, Q-APR<sub>90</sub>, measured to the time at 90% AP recovery, was compared with two measures of the QT interval. QT1 was measured to the recovery of the ECG trace to the isoelectric baseline for entirely positive T-waves or to the trough of any negative T-wave undershoot. QT2&#x02014;used extensively in previous studies&#x02014;was measured to the return of any ECG trough to the isoelectric baseline. QT1, but not QT2, closely correlated with changes in Q-APR<sub>90</sub>. These findings were confirmed over a range of pacing rates, in low K<sup>+</sup> concentration solutions, and in <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x00394;<italic>KPQ</italic> hearts used to model human long QT syndrome. Application of this method in whole anesthetized mice similarly demonstrated a prolonged corrected QT (QTc) in <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x00394;<italic>KPQ</italic> hearts. We therefore describe a robust method for the determination of QT and QTc intervals that correlate with the duration of ventricular myocyte APs in murine hearts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>action-potential duration</kwd><kwd>ECG</kwd><kwd>QT interval</kwd><kwd>mouse heart</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><sc>the duration of ventricular</sc> depolarization and repolarization is reflected in the ECG QT interval (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It is important for the diagnosis of inherited and iatrogenic QT disorders associated with increased risks of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or Torsades de Pointes that may present as long or short QT syndromes. Transgenic mouse hearts have proven increasingly useful in modeling human cardiac arrhythmic disease. However, mice differ from humans in aspects of cardiac electrophysiology that have implications for ECG interpretation. Murine hearts show shorter electrocardiographic RR intervals, reflecting higher heart rates (600 beats/min).</p><p>Murine QRS-T complexes reflect considerably shorter action-potential (AP) waveforms lacking plateau phases, resulting in indistinct ST segments and T-waves (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Nevertheless, the T-wave is often assumed to end at its return to the isoelectric baseline (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, where the T-wave in some mouse ECG traces shows an apparent negative undershoot, in addition to its positive component, this approach would substantially increase estimates of the QT interval or preclude determination of QT intervals at high heart rates when the P-wave often becomes superimposed upon the terminal phase of the previous negative undershoot (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Previous murine studies had adopted different empirical QT estimation methods, including determining: <italic>1</italic>) the time taken to reach 95% recovery for the ECG deflection to return to baseline (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); <italic>2</italic>) the time to the end of the T-wave, itself defined as the point at which the T-wave time course deviates from the tangent to the steepest slope of the time course of T-wave recovery (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); <italic>3</italic>) the time at which the QT segment returns to baseline (3, 6, 9a); and <italic>4</italic>) the point of convergence of T-waves and their first derivative on a signal-averaged ECG recording (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These various approaches met with variable success, leading to doubts as to whether ECG analysis of this kind could quantify murine AP parameters (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The present paper develops a simple empirical approach for measuring the QT interval in mouse ECGs by comparing ECGs with simultaneous intracellular recordings of AP waveforms in Langendorff-perfused hearts.

Their aortas were cannulated, and the heart was perfused at a constant flow rate of 3 ml/min (Bredel peristaltic pumps, model 505S; Watson-Marlow, Falmouth, Cornwall, UK) with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution (in mM: NaCl 119, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, KCl 4, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, glucose 10, Na-pyruvate 2, pH adjusted to 7.4), bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> (British Oxygen, Manchester, UK) on a Langendorff system. The KH solution was passed through a 5-&#x003bc;m filter (Millipore, Watford, UK) and warmed to 37&#x000b0;C using a water jacket and circulator (model C-85A; Techne, Cambridge, UK). Hearts were laid down with their anterior surfaces facing upward in a homemade, warmed bath chamber. Only hearts that regained their pink color and showed 1:1 atrioventricular conduction with intrinsic activity and after 10&#x02013;15 min perfusion for stabilization were then subjected to further electrophysiological testing.</p><p>A floating microelectrode holder was constructed from a thin, coiled silver wire (0.4 mm in diameter) and connected to a 2-mm connecter. A glass micropipette was drawn from borosilicate glass to a very fine tip and filled immediately before use with 3 M KCl. The pipette was cut above its shoulders, and the remaining shank was discarded. The microelectrode resistances were 15&#x02013;25 M&#x003a9;. The chlorided end of the silver wire was inserted into the micropipette, with which impalements were made close to the midpoint between ventricular apex and base, and connected to a high-input impedance direct-current microelectrode amplifier system (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK). The signals were displayed, digitized, and analyzed using Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Conversion of the analog input to digital signals was performed using a model Micro1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic Design) connected to an IBM-compatible computer. Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design) was used to record and subsequently analyze ECG recordings. The entire apparatus was mounted on a vibration-isolation platform in a grounded Faraday cage. APs showing straight upstrokes, with AP amplitudes &#x0003e;75 mV, maximum rates of rise &#x0003e;85 mV/ms, and resting potentials between &#x02212;80 and &#x02212;65 mV, were used for further analysis.</p><p>Volume-conducted ECGs were recorded simultaneously with the AP recordings. Three-needle electrodes were immersed in the superfused bath flanking the isolated heart. Signals were amplified and filtered by a model NL104A amplifier (NeuroLog; Digitimer, Hertfordshire, UK) and a model NL125/126 filter (set to a bandwidth of 10&#x02013;5,000 Hz). Conversions of analog input to digital form used a model 1401+ interface (Cambridge Electronic Design) connected to an IBM-compatible computer. Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design) was used to record and subsequently analyze ECG recordings.</p><p>An initial series of experiments studied hearts in sinus rhythm. Further experiments assessed the ECG measured under conditions of regular stimulation at cycle lengths (CL) of 200, 167, and 143 ms, at which 50 APs were recorded for each CL. This used a bipolar, platinum-stimulating electrode (1 mm interpole spacing) placed against the right atrial epicardium, delivering square-wave stimuli (Grass S48 stimulator; Grass-Telefactor, Slough, UK) of 2-ms duration and amplitudes of twice diastolic excitation threshold. The experiments also examined the effect of reducing the extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] from normokalemic (4 mM) to hypokalemic (3 mM) levels in the KH perfusate to investigate the effects of conditions that would prolong the QT interval and its measurement.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-1-3"><title>Measurements from the ECG and intracellular AP traces.</title><p>The duration of ventricular electrophysiological activity was determined by three measurements from the ECG and the AP traces. In each case, peaks and recovery times were obtained from direct readouts from successive averages of five data points, obtained by software cursors successively moved along the time axis. In the ECG traces, the position of the isoelectric baseline was defined as falling between the end of the upright P-wave and the beginning of the QRS in the volume-conducted ECGs, as on previous occasions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The beginning of ventricular electrical activity was defined by the onset of the QRS in the ECG trace, where it deviated from this isoelectric baseline. The QT interval was then calculated by two methods. <italic>1</italic>) QT1 was measured to the time at which the ECG trace first reached its minimum value; this was the isoelectric baseline when the T-wave only showed positive components or the point of maximum undershoot where records showed a negative undershoot. <italic>2</italic>) QT2 was defined as the time at which the T-wave reached the isoelectric baseline. <italic>3</italic>) For comparison with ECG records, the Q-APR<sub>90</sub> was defined as the time intervening between the start of the ECG QRS complex and the time of the APR<sub>90</sub>, the point of 90% recovery of the ventricular AP from its peak to the isoelectric baseline in the intracellular microelectrode recordings. Corrected QT (QTc) intervals were then obtained using the formula QTc = QT/(RR/100)<sup>1/2</sup> to give QTc1, QTc2, and Q-APR<sub>90</sub>c respectively (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-1-4"><title>In vivo ECG recordings from mice under terminal anesthesia.</title><p>Independent, in vivo ECG studies were performed on mice anesthetized with a dose of 0.10 ml/10 g body wt of either: <italic>1</italic>) a solution comprising 1.8 ml of 100 mg/ml ketamine hydrochloride (Ketaset; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Southampton, UK), 0.35 ml of 23.32 mg/ml xylazine hydrochloride (Rompun; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), and 2.85 ml of sterile phosphate-base solution or <italic>2</italic>) 24 mg/ml ip Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol; Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK) into the left peritoneal cavity, respectively, 15 and 5 min before recording.
