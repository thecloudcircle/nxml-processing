Targeting is accomplished with the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to receptors present on the DC surface fused with the antigen of interest. An anti-DEC205 mAb has been successfully used to target antigens to the DEC205<sup>+</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC subset. The administration of low doses of the hybrid mAb together with DC maturation stimuli is able to activate specific T cells and induce production of high antibody titres for a number of different antigens. However, it is still not known if this approach would work with any fused protein. Here we genetically fused the &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb with two fragments (42-kDa and 19-kDa) derived from the ~200&#x02009;kDa <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), known as MSP1<sub>42</sub> and MSP1<sub>19</sub>, respectively. The administration of two doses of &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub>, but not of &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> mAb, together with an adjuvant to two mouse strains induced high anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody titres that were dependent on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells elicited by peptides present in the MSP1<sub>33</sub> sequence, indicating that the presence of T cell epitopes in antigens targeted to DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs increases antibody responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>DCs are an important bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses.

Would any antigen be able to induce strong T cell and antibody responses if targeted to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DC subpopulation? To start addressing this question, we fused the &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb with two fragments of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) derived from <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, the most prevalent species that causes human malaria. MSP1 is expressed during the erythrocytic phase of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle and participates in parasite invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. It is expressed as an ~200&#x02009;kDa precursor on the surface of the merozoite, and undergoes successive proteolytic cleavages generating a 42-kDa fragment (MSP1<sub>42</sub>) that is further cleaved into two products: a soluble 33-kDa fragment (MSP1<sub>33</sub>) that corresponds to the N-terminal region of MSP1<sub>42</sub> and is shed from the free merozoite surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and a membrane-bound 19-kDa C-terminal fragment (MSP1<sub>19</sub>), which is the only MSP1 fragment carried with the invading merozoite into the new red blood cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Infection with <italic>Plasmodium sp.</italic> leads to the induction of antibodies that bind mainly to the MSP1<sub>19</sub> protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> while MSP1<sub>42</sub> is thought to contain T cell epitopes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> that help B cells to produce anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.

Analysis of the immune response induced by immunization with the two hybrid mAbs in the presence of poly (I:C) showed that T cell epitopes are indeed present in the MSP1<sub>33</sub> portion of the molecule and that induction of high titres of anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies is obtained mainly when MSP1<sub>42</sub> is targeted to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DC population.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The hybrid &#x003b1;DEC mAbs containing MSP1<sub>19</sub> or MSP1<sub>42</sub> fused proteins were successfully produced and capable of binding to the DEC205 receptor</title><p>For the production of &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> and &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> mAbs, the open reading frames from <italic>msp1</italic><sub><italic>19</italic></sub> or <italic>msp1</italic><sub><italic>42</italic></sub> genes were cloned in frame with the carboxyl-terminal portion of the heavy chain of the &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb exactly as described in methods and in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. As a control, we also produced the &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb without any fused antigen. Of note, all our attempts to produce an isotype control fused with the MSP1<sub>42</sub> protein failed, as the hybrid mAb came out very degraded (data not shown). After transient transfection, the &#x003b1;DEC hybrid mAbs were purified and their integrity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. The recombinant proteins MSP1<sub>19</sub> and MSP1<sub>33</sub> were also produced and evaluated in the same manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). A reduced gel showed that the heavy chains of the hybrid mAbs had the expected electrophoretic motilities (~92&#x02009;kDa for &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub>, ~69&#x02009;kDa for &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> and ~50&#x02009;kDa for &#x003b1;DEC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). All light chains migrated at ~25&#x02009;kDa. Recombinant (rec.) MSP1<sub>19</sub> and MSP1<sub>33</sub> proteins migrated at ~19&#x02009;kDa and ~33&#x02009;kDa, respectively. The non-reduced gel showed mainly the presence of a single band for each of the mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to verify if both hybrid mAbs and recombinant proteins retained antigenicity, a western blot was performed using sera from a <italic>P. vivax</italic> infected patient. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows that the patient&#x02019;s serum recognized the heavy chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), or the entire hybrid mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>) containing MSP1<sub>42</sub> or MSP1<sub>19</sub>.

The empty &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb was used as control. All mAbs bound specifically and in a dose dependent manner to the CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> panel) or to CHO cells expressing the murine DEC205 receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>).

Groups of C57BL/6 or B10.A mice received two doses containing 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of each hybrid mAb or the empty &#x003b1;DEC administered in a 30-day interval in the presence of poly (I:C). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a schematic representation of the immunization protocol. Five days before or 14 days after the administration of the second dose, mice were bled and anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> or anti-MSP1<sub>33</sub> antibody titres were measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B&#x02013;E</xref>). In both mouse strains, the antibody titres against MSP1<sub>19</sub> increased after the administration of the second dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>) in mice immunized either with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> or &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub>. No anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> titres were detected in the group immunized with &#x003b1;DEC. Of note was the fact that in both mouse strains, the amount of anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies induced in mice that received &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb was approximately 100x higher than in mice that received &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> mAb. As expected, anti-MSP1<sub>33</sub> antibodies were only detected in mice immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). To compare the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody response in the presence or absence of DEC205<sup>+</sup> DC targeting, we immunized groups of C57BL/6 mice with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub>, &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub>, &#x003b1;DEC, rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub>, rec. MSP1<sub>33</sub> or with a combination of rec. MSP1<sub>33</sub> and MSP1<sub>19</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). To our surprise, mice immunized with rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> were able to produce anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies that, despite slightly lower, were not statistically different from those observed in mice immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). No difference was also observed between the &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> and rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub>+MSP1<sub>33</sub> groups. To better characterize the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> response, the IgG subtypes were analysed in both mouse strains and the IgG1/IgG2c ratio was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Both C57BL/6 and B10.A mice presented detectable levels of all IgGs in the group immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb. An analysis of the IgG1/IgG2c ratio showed that the response in both mouse strains was prone to Th1 (IgG1/IgG2c&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1). On the other hand, in the group immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> (in both mouse strains) or with rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> or rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub>+MSP1<sub>33</sub> (in C57BL/6 mice), a more Th2 type of response was observed (IgG1/IgG2c&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1).</p><p>The detection of all IgG subclasses in the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody response in both mouse strains, and especially in the &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> immunized group, suggested that B cells were undergoing class switching and probably affinity maturation. To test this hypothesis, we measured the avidity index of the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies in C57BL/6 and B10.A mice immunized with the hybrid mAbs or with the rec. proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). We observed that anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies induced in both mouse strains immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> showed a higher avidity index when compared to the group immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). More importantly, the avidity index presented by C57BL/6 mice immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> was higher than the observed in groups that received rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> or rec. MSP1<sub>33</sub>+MSP1<sub>19</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that MSP1<sub>42</sub> targeting to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DC subset is able to alter the quality of the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> humoral immune response.</p><p>It was previously shown that antigen targeting to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs induces an antibody response that requires T cell help<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. To confirm this requirement in our model, we immunized WT, CD4 KO and MHCII KO mice (C57BL/6 background) with our hybrid mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). As expected, the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> response was abolished in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or MHCII presentation.</p><p>To test if the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies could bind to the MSP1<sub>19</sub> protein on the surface of cells, we transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid capable of expressing the MSP1<sub>19</sub> as a transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). As a negative control, HEK293T cells were also transfected with a plasmid containing the unrelated Duffy binding protein II (DBPII, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). Besides MSP1<sub>19</sub> or DBPII proteins, both plasmids also expressed the green fluorescence protein (GFP). GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were gated for the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">D</xref>). We observed that anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies induced in mice immunized with either &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> or &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> in both mouse strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2E</xref> for C57BL/6, and 2G for B10.A) bound to the MSP1<sub>19</sub> expressing cells while no significant ligation was observed in the DBPII transfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2F</xref> for C57BL/6, and 2H for B10.A). It is important to mention that to perform this assay we normalized the amount of anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies present in the sera.</p><p>In summary, the results presented above show that immunization with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> is able to induce stronger and broader humoral immune response when compared with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub>, in two different mouse strains.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MSP1<sub>42</sub> targeting to DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs induces activation and proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the 33-kDa fragment</title><p>The results described above suggested that MSP1<sub>42</sub> sequence carried epitopes that might provide help for the B cell mediated antibody production when targeted to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs.

MSP1<sub>19</sub> induced fewer IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells in C57BL/6 and in B10.A, indicating that the immunodominant T cell epitopes are probably present in the 33-kDa portion of MSP1<sub>42</sub>. Of note, we were able to detect a reasonable number of IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells in C57BL/6 mice immunized with the rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> but not in the animals immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> when the splenocytes were pulsed with the same protein. To further analyse the response, we took advantage of the fact that T cells from B10.A mice recognize peptide DYDVVYLKPLAGMYK previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We then pulsed splenocytes from &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub>, &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> or &#x003b1;DEC immunized mice with the DYDVVYLKPLAGMYK peptide and observed that only cells derived from &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mice were able to produce IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, the number detected (~380 per 10<sup>6</sup> total splenocytes) was smaller than the number obtained when the pulse was performed with the recombinant MSP1<sub>33</sub> protein (~1,100 per 10<sup>6</sup> total splenocytes), indicating that there are probably other epitopes that still need to be mapped.</p><p>To further investigate the cellular immune response induced in mice immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb, we evaluated the production of three inflammatory cytokines: IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; by CD4<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (data not shown). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from either C57BL/6 or B10.A mice immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> were able to produce the three cytokines when restimulated only with MSP1<sub>33</sub> recombinant protein. Restimulation with recombinant MSP1<sub>19</sub> was unable to elicit significant percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 or TNF&#x003b1; in C57BL/6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>) or B10.A mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, very low levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing any cytokine were observed in C57BL/6 immunized with rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> or rec. MSP1<sub>33</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Although surprising, we did not detect specific responses elicited in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (data not shown). Using boolean gating analysis, we were able to detect the simultaneous production of the inflammatory cytokines IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). We observed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from mice immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb were able to produce combinations of the three tested cytokines in both mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, C57BL/6 and 6B, B10.A) when pulsed with MSP1<sub>33</sub> recombinant protein. In fact, in both mouse strains we were able to detect polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing all combinations of the three cytokines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), especially those producing all three at the same time. To access T cell proliferation, splenocytes from mice immunized with the hybrid mAbs or rec. proteins were stained with CFSE and pulsed with either recombinant MSP1<sub>19</sub> or MSP1<sub>33</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation was observed in both mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>, C57BL/6 and 7B, B10.A) mainly in the animals immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> pulsed with recombinant MSP1<sub>33</sub>. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation was not observed in any case (data not shown). In addition, we observed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from B10.A mice also proliferated in response to the DYDVVYLKPLAGMYK peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>). However, the percentage of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that responded to this peptide was smaller than that obtained when recombinant MSP1<sub>33</sub> was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>) indicating the presence of other T cell epitopes in the MSP1<sub>33</sub> protein sequence.</p><p>The results presented above show that antigen targeting to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DC population in the presence of poly (I:C) is effective in inducing potent antibody and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses when epitopes are present in the protein structure.

In addition, the induction of antibodies against the fused antigen was also reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. All these studies used antigens previously described as immunogenic. However, to our knowledge, no one has yet targeted different fragments of the same antigen to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs, and asked what would be the immune response outcome. To start addressing that question, we produced two mAbs containing fragments of the MSP1 protein derived from <italic>P. vivax</italic>. The &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> mAb contains the C-terminal 19-kDa fragment, which is normally target of antibodies in infected individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, while the &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb contains the 19-kDa fragment (MSP1<sub>19</sub>) fused with the 33-kDa (MSP1<sub>33</sub>) fragment that was shown to elicit T cell responses in the field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Of note, it was not evaluated which epitopes were recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Both hybrid &#x003b1;DEC-derived mAbs were produced successfully, retained antigenicity and were able to target the DEC205 receptor expressed on the surface of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC population. This is not the first time a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> derived antigen is fused to the &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb. Previously, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from <italic>P. yoelii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> was also used to immunized mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and non-human primates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, to our knowledge, this is the first time an antigen expressed by the erythrocytic stage (merozoites) is fused to the &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb. We took advantage of the fact that MSP1<sub>42</sub> contains MSP1<sub>19</sub>, and immunized mice with both &#x003b1;DEC-derived hybrid mAbs in an attempt to study the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody response elicited when MSP1<sub>19</sub> was targeted alone or fused to MSP1<sub>33</sub>. As mentioned previously, we were unable to produce an isotype control fused to the MSP1<sub>42</sub> protein, and then used the recombinant proteins as non-targeted controls. The use of poly (I:C) as a DC maturation stimulus is well documented in the literature and it seems to be very potent when administered together with &#x003b1;DEC205 fusion mAbs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. An increase in either anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> or anti-MSP1<sub>33</sub> antibody titres was observed after the administration of the second dose, which has been consistently observed in other models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Interestingly, the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody titres were increased about 100x when MSP1<sub>42</sub> was targeted to the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC population in two different mouse strains. This result suggested that the presence of MSP1<sub>33</sub> fragment was helping to increase the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody response possibly because of the presence of additional T cell epitopes in the region of 33&#x02009;kDa. However, to our surprise, immunization with rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> or with rec. MSP1<sub>33</sub>+MSP1<sub>19</sub> was able to induce high anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody titres in C57BL/6 mice that were not different from those induced by &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub>. This result was unexpected but may reflect a longer persistence of rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> in the circulation leading to an increase in the antigen uptake by B cells. We also cannot rule out the possibility that MSP1<sub>19</sub> contains minor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes responsible for helping B cells to produce antibodies when the protein is not directly targeted to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs. The dependency of T cell help for the induction of antibody responses after targeting to DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs was shown after immunization of CD4 and MHCII KO mice, when complete abrogation of the antibody response was observed in the animals. To characterize in more detail the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody response, we carefully analysed the IgG subclasses induced when the hybrid mAbs or the rec. proteins were used. Surprisingly, immunization with the &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb induced a very different profile of IgG subclasses when compared to either &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> or rec. proteins immunized mice. The IgG1/IgG2c ratio in animals immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> was &#x0003c;1, indicating a more prone Th1-type of response in both mouse strains analysed. On the other hand, the group immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> or with the rec. proteins showed a higher IgG1/IgG2c ratio (&#x0003e;1) in both mouse strains. Previous reports have shown that antigen targeting through DEC205 is able to elicit high titres of IgG2c (or IgG2a, depending on the mouse strain)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. These results also suggested that immunization with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> could be inducing a more pronounced class switch that would imply in an increase in affinity maturation. We then measured the avidity index of the polyclonal sera induced in mice immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub>, &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> or with the rec. proteins. In both mouse strains, the avidity index was higher in the sera of animals immunized with the &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb, suggesting that the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> specific B cells were undergoing affinity maturation particularly in this group of mice. On the other hand, the ability to bind to MSP1<sub>19</sub> expressed on the surface of transiently transfected HEK293T cells was similar between the groups immunized with either &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> or &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> mAbs, when we considered dilutions where both sera presented similar OD values. Despite the similar binding observed when similar amounts of anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibodies were used, the fact that immunization with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> induces higher antibody titres with increased avidity may be favourable in the field where higher anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> titres have been associated with protection against malaria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p><p>The results involving the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody response described above indicated that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were being activated during immunization with the &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb, as the initial T-B cell interaction leads to germinal centre formation, affinity maturation, and isotype switching. The increased production of IgG2c prompted us to investigate if T cells were able to produce IFN-&#x003b3;, a cytokine associated with the production of this subclass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. We were able to detect high numbers of IFN-&#x003b3; producing T cells in both mouse strains immunized with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb only when splenocytes were pulsed with the recombinant MSP1<sub>33</sub> protein. This indicated that the immunodominant epitopes were restricted to the 33-kDa fragment of the molecule. Interestingly, we did not observe a noticeable response when the rec. MSP1<sub>33</sub> was used as immunogen. On the other hand, we were able to detect IFN-&#x003b3; producing T cells in animals immunized with rec. MSP1<sub>19</sub> whose splenocytes were pulsed with the same protein. In addition, we found that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by immunization with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>42</sub> mAb were able to produce different combinations of three inflammatory cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1;), and proliferate, when pulsed with the MSP1<sub>33</sub> recombinant protein. These results showed that the presence of immunodominant epitopes in the 33-kDa fragment of MSP1 activate polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> antibody response. In B10.A mice, we were able to detect a specific response against the previously defined DYDVVYLKPLAGMYK epitope<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, but more epitopes are probably present on the MSP1<sub>33</sub> sequence as this response was weaker than that observed with the recombinant MSP1<sub>33</sub> pulse. To completely map the immunodominant epitopes, additional experiments using peptide libraries will be necessary. Induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and cytokine production after immunization with a hybrid &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb in the presence of poly (I:C) has been reported previously by Trumpfheller <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The use of a &#x003b1;DEC205 mAb fused to a HIV protein elicited mainly CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that proliferated and produced the three inflammatory cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1;). In our case, we detected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that proliferated vigorously after recombinant MSP1<sub>33</sub> pulse and were capable of producing not only three cytokines simultaneously, but also two or one. On the other hand, immunization with &#x003b1;DEC-MSP1<sub>19</sub> mAb or with the rec. proteins was extremely inefficient in inducing either proliferation or cytokine production. These results highlight the importance of the antigen choice when targeting the DEC205 receptor on the surface of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs.</p><p>Of note, we have to mention that contrary to other results previously reported on the literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, we did not detect CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation or cytokine production when MSP1<sub>42</sub> or MSP1<sub>19</sub> were targeted to the DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs. The simpler explanation may be that <italic>P. vivax</italic> MSP1<sub>42</sub> sequence does not contain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes or those epitopes are not recognized by C57BL/6 and B10.A haplotypes. We were unable to find in the literature any previous reports mapping CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes to both <italic>P. vivax</italic> MSP1<sub>42</sub> and MSP1<sub>19</sub> proteins. However, we found one report that described CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes in the sequence of the murine <italic>P. yoelii</italic> MSP1<sub>42</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. It is important to mention that the amino acid sequences of MSP1 from <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. yoelii</italic> are quite distinct, and that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected in BALB/c mice after immunization with a recombinant adenovirus. Besides, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected after splenocytes were pulsed with peptide pools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Indeed, almost every time CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected after antigen targeting to CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs, detection was measured using overlapping peptide libraries or previously described peptides, and frequently previously enriched CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In this work, we did not use overlapping peptide libraries or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell enrichment. Instead, bulk splenocytes were pulsed directly with the rec. proteins. Another explanation that may account for the absence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell detection may have to do with the timing of analysis. Here we analysed cellular immune responses on day 20 after boost while others normally analyse T cell responses at earlier time points<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In an attempt to maximize our window of detection, we analysed the animals on day 5 after the boost, and still could not detect CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation or cytokine production (data not shown). However, we still cannot rule out the possibility of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation because we did not enrich the T cells or used peptide libraries. In fact, we plan to explore those possibilities in the future. Finally, it is important to point out that MSP1<sub>42</sub> is an antigen expressed during the erythrocytic phase of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle, and the evidence points to a role of antibodies and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in protection, while CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells would have a more pronounced role during the pre-erythrocytic phase, before the parasites reach the blood.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that the choice of the antigen may be important when designing vaccines targeted to the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>DEC205<sup>+</sup> DC subset.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>Six- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 CD4 KO mice were bred at the Isogenic Mouse Facility of the Parasitology Department, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil.

Briefly, high binding ELISA plates (Costar) were coated overnight at room temperature (rt) with 100&#x02009;ng/well of MSP1<sub>19</sub> or MSP1<sub>33</sub> recombinant proteins diluted in PBS. After three washes and one-hour incubation in blocking buffer (PBS-Tween 20 0.02%, non-fat milk 5% and BSA 1%), sera were serially diluted in PBS-Tween 20 0.02%, non-fat milk 5% and BSA 0.25% and incubated for 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;h at rt. The secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific-HRP (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or anti-mouse IgG subclass-HRP specific antibodies (1:3,000; SouthernBiotech) were added after three additional washes. After one-hour incubation at rt, plates were vigorously washed and the enzymatic reaction was developed by the addition of 1&#x02009;mg/ml of ortho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) diluted in phosphate&#x02013;citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.03% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide.

Titres represent the highest serum dilution showing an OD<sub>490</sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.1 normalized in a log10 scale. The IgG1/IgG2c ratio was calculated by dividing the mean values of the highest serum dilution obtained for IgG1 by the mean value of the highest serum dilution obtained for IgG2c without normalization.
