We offer a novel solution by asking if a newly met stranger could provide a processing advantage in a shape-identity matching task where shapes were associated with the names of different identities. Each participant was paired with a newly met partner in a joint shape-identity matching task in which three shapes were associated with the names of the participant&#x000a0;or his/her best friend, the partner, and a stranger, respectively. The participants judged whether or not the shape and name correctly matched.</p><p id="Par2">Intriguingly, the trials related to a newly&#x000a0;met partner exhibited instant referential saliency, which was more accurate and faster than that related to the stranger&#x02019;s name (baseline) when the partner was physically present (experiments 1, 2, 4, 5), but not when the partner was absent (experiment 3). Self-advantage, however, was robust and lasting. The precursor of physical presence when forming referential saliency toward a stranger and its distinct temporal dynamics imply a novel referential benefit unendowed with familiarity, which is qualitatively different from the well-documented self/friend-advantage effect.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s41235-019-0186-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Partner-advantage</kwd><kwd>Self-advantage</kwd><kwd>Self-bias</kwd><kwd>Identity referential advantage</kwd><kwd>Familiarity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010235</institution-id><institution>Tohoku University Center for Gender Equality Promotion</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006467</institution-id><institution>Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cooperative Research Project Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tseng</surname><given-names>Chia-huei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas </institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 18H04180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tseng</surname><given-names>Chia-huei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Significance</title><p id="Par3">During a social interaction, the most important first step is to identify the participants and their relationship to us (e.g. superiors, friends, subordinates). The ability to process people&#x02019;s identities helps us to interact appropriately in all social contexts. Extensive research has shown that we prioritize processing for identities that are important and familiar (e.g. mother, friend, and self). Neural objects associated with self and significant others are processed faster and more accurately than objects associated with strangers; we also perceive objects and events associated with important identities more favorably, remember them better, and pay more attention to them. However, we meet new people all the time, and it is unknown whether similar modulations occur at the initial stage of a relationship or how identity-advantage develops over time. Most scientific studies focus on the advantage effect in relation to identities with high social significance and high familiarity and so have been unable to inform us about this missing information as regards strangers. We designed a critical study to successfully observe the identity-advantage toward a newly&#x000a0;met partner with minimal intercourse. We discovered a distinct time-course based on priority processing for self and significant others, and that the physical appearance of the partner is critical. This is the first study exploring the minimal requirement for provoking an identity referential advantage in the early stages of a social relationship. It is likely to be served by a dissociable pathway independent from the pathway that processes long-term personal significance. Our research provides a new theoretical perspective of identity referential processing and poses a well-defined working hypothesis for future studies to investigate the dissociable mechanisms that underlie slow and fast pathways for other-referential advantage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">The processing priority of a stimulus is modulated when attached to identities (e.g. self, friend, or stranger). The most extensively studied case in identity referential processing, namely self-advantage (also known as self-bias), refers to the facilitation of performance toward stimuli related to one&#x02019;s &#x0201c;self&#x0201d;, such as one&#x02019;s own face (Ma &#x00026; Han, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>; Tong &#x00026; Nakayama, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1999</xref>) and name (Harris, Pashler, &#x00026; Coburn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>; Moray, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1959</xref>), as opposed to stimuli related to other identities. This benefit also extends to neutral stimuli newly associated with one&#x02019;s self, such as geometric shapes (Sui, He, &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>), movements (Frings &#x00026; Wentura, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>), concrete objects (Cunningham, Brebner, Quinn, &#x00026; Turk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>), and abstract concepts (Sch&#x000e4;fer, Wentura, &#x00026; Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>). It has been proposed that the sense of self serves as glue, interlinking various functions such as perception, attention, memory, and decision making (Humphreys &#x00026; Sui, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>; Northoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>; Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">A similar advantage also applies to significant others such as friends and mothers, although to a lesser extent. Better performance was observed in a face identity classification task when friends&#x02019; rather than strangers&#x02019; faces were present (Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>) and in a shape-identity matching task when shapes were associated with a friend or mother than with a stranger (Sui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>) or a neutral object (Sch&#x000e4;fer, Frings, &#x00026; Wentura, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>). Zhang and colleagues (Zhang, Zhu, &#x00026; Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>) asked participants to judge a total of 144 traits of self, a close friend, and a celebrity, followed by a surprising memory recognition task on trait adjectives. They found that if the trait appeared in a question about a friend, it was better recognized than celebrity-related traits.</p><p id="Par6">Whether or not there are distinct mechanisms underlying self-advantage and other-advantage is currently unknown. Research has shown that other-advantage is easily weakened, and even eliminated, by low-rewarded association (Sui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>; Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>), degradation of stimulus probability (Sui, Sun, Peng, &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>), and luminance contrast (Sui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>). Lack of robustness indicates that other-advantage may have the plasticity needed to allow it to be easily built or shaped. In contrast, self continues to enjoy absolute priority of processing, which is difficult to attenuate by perceptual degradation. The difference in robustness was taken to suggest that the mechanisms underlying the performance advantage toward self and significant others are essentially different.</p><p id="Par7">However, because the above-reported other-advantage occurs in identities with strong familiarity and social significance, such as mother and best friend, it is still unknown how identity referential advantage is formed and whether it is involved in the early stage of relationships. We investigate this topic by testing whether or not identity-advantage can be created toward a newly met stranger. We adopted the shape-name association task described in Sui et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>), and introduced a new identity: a newly met stranger to co-act with participants as partners in a joint task (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The task required participants to associate three geometric shapes (square, circle, and triangle) with three names. The names were own name or best friend&#x02019;s name, a newly met partner&#x02019;s name and a unisex neutral stranger&#x02019;s name (&#x0541b;&#x0660e;, i.e. Jun Ming in Mandarin). Participants were presented with a pair consisting of a name and a shape and required to judge whether or not they matched. The performance in these three identity categories was analyzed as an index of identity priority processing.
<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Experimental conditions and matching task. In experiment 1 (the joint condition), two participants performed the task on separate keyboards. Each participant responded only to their assigned color (red or green) in the task&#x000a0;(go trials). In this example, their names and a neutral name were assigned to correspond to three shapes (square, triangle, and circle), which participants had to memorize for the name-shape matching task. In experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5 (individual condition), the other participant waited outside the room. Similarly, participants responded only to their assigned color (go trials) but not the other color (no-go trials). In experiments 2, 4, and 5, the participants briefly met the partners without any verbal communication, while in experiment 3, the participants never met the partners.

We then removed the components comprising &#x0201c;partner&#x0201d; one by one. In experiment 2, the participants met a new partner briefly without actually performing the joint task together. In experiment 3, participants were introduced to their partner by name only without any physical presence. Experiment 4 was to estimate whether the process advantage associated with the newly met partner was comparable to friend-advantage. Experiment 5 was a control experiment. Together, our results suggested that an identity referential advantage could be established toward a stranger without prior familiarity or a close relationship to self.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Purpose</title><p id="Par9">The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether or not an identity referential advantage can be created towards a co-acting partner in a joint action context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par10">The sample size was determined based on previous studies (e.g. Sui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>). A significant self-advantage and friend-advantage was reported as a result of analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of sensitivity (<italic>d</italic> prime (<italic>d</italic>&#x02019;)) and response time (RT) conducted on 18 participants with effect sizes (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>) of 0.41 and 0.67 respectively. We anticipate a smaller effect size here because we replaced friends with a newly met partner. Therefore, with an estimated <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.2, we expected an effect size <italic>f</italic> of 0.50. Then a power analysis that we conducted using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &#x00026; Buchner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>) yielded a sample size of 22 needed for the <italic>F</italic> test (ANOVA, repeated measures, within factors) to for power of 0.8 with the alpha value at 0.05.

The names were those of two participants and a neutral name. To control the length of the names, they all consisted of two Chinese characters. The last two characters (first name) were used if a participant&#x02019;s name had three characters. A unisex name (&#x0541b;&#x0660e;) was used as the neutral name. The participants confirmed that they had not known anyone with either of the other two names before the experiment. The stimuli were shown against a black background. One name (visual angle of 4.3&#x000b0; &#x000d7;&#x02009;2.2&#x000b0;) was presented above a central gray fixation cross (visual angle of 0.5&#x000b0; &#x000d7;&#x02009;0.5&#x000b0;), and one shape (visual angle of 3.4&#x000b0; &#x000d7;&#x02009;3.4&#x000b0;) was presented below the fixation cross (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The distance between the names or shapes and the fixation was a visual angle of 7.2&#x000b0;. The experiment was conducted with E-prime software (Version 2.0) on a 24-in. Dell monitor (E248WFPb, 1440&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;900, 60&#x02009;Hz).

The two participants were separated before any further opportunities for verbal communication, and took turns to receive instruction and practice trials in the experimental room while the other waited outside. The participants were instructed to remember matching rules for three names and three shapes: self was associated with a square, partner with a circle, and triangle with a neutral stranger who never showed up (&#x0541b;&#x0660e;). The rules were identical for all the participants. Each participant undertook 30 practice trials alone before performing 450 trials in the formal experiment (3 blocks, 150 trials each) sitting beside their partner in front of one monitor with separate response keyboards (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> summarizes the experimental procedure. All the trials started with a fixation cross presented for 500&#x02009;ms, followed by the name-shape pairing stimulus for 100&#x02009;ms. The name was written in red or green. The color served as a go/no-go signal. Within each pair, one participant responded only to red names and the other only to green names. The participants needed to indicate whether the name and the shape matched or not as accurately and quickly as possible with two keys (&#x0201c;n&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;v&#x0201d; for one participant, &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; for the other). After the response had been received, visual feedback (&#x0201c;Correct&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Incorrect&#x0201d;) was displayed for 500&#x02009;ms. If the participants did not respond within 1000&#x02009;ms, the program displayed feedback consisting of the word &#x0201c;Slow&#x0201d; for 500&#x02009;ms, and the next trial began. Slow trials were considered inaccurate responses during data analysis. When the participants responded in the no-go trial (partner&#x02019;s trial), they also received the feedback &#x0201c;Incorrect&#x0201d;. If both participants responded to one trial, only the faster response was recorded and feedback was provided accordingly. The participants were instructed to maintain overall accuracy while responding as quickly as possible. There was no special reward for any specific identity category, thus ensuring that the participants would not strategically favor any particular identity to maximize the reward. The entire experiment lasted about 30&#x02009;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><p id="Par15">Results obtained from all 22 participants were included in the data analysis. Data from two participants in one session were processed individually (i.e. not combined for pair analysis). Responses faster than 200&#x02009;ms were excluded, eliminating a total of 3.6% of the trials. Only accurate trials were included in the RT analysis and 8.4% of trials in which there were erroneous responses were excluded.</p><p id="Par16">To investigate identity-related advantage, we compared the <italic>d&#x02019;</italic> and RT in trials relating to different identities using ANOVA.

Participants performed better from the beginning block onwards with a partner-associated pairing than with a stranger-associated pairing, and this advantage gradually decreased. However, the self-advantage remained robust through the whole experiment. The partner-advantage in experiment 1 is unexpected because facilitated performance was observed only for familiar people (e.g. friends and mothers) in previous studies (Sch&#x000e4;fer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Sui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>; Sun, Fuentes, Humphreys, &#x00026; Sui, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). Our participants had no social interaction or verbal communication with their assigned partners and never heard each other&#x02019;s names. In this case, three factors distinguished the roles of partner and neutral stranger: first, the participants briefly met their partners in person; second, the assignment as a partner enjoyed a social labeling that the neutral stranger name did not have; third, the participants co-acted the task with the partner. Which factor was the major contributor to our observed partner-advantage? To answer this question, we isolated these factors in experiments 2 and 3, and tested whether the partner-advantage persisted when the partner did not co-act the task (experiment 2) or even show up (experiment 3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Purpose</title><p id="Par23">This experiment was designed to investigate without joint action whether or not a short exposure to a partner was sufficient to induce beneficial partner-related processing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par24">Another 26 university students participated in this study (13 men and 13 women), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

It is surprising that the joint-task condition did not enhance the partner-advantage as social context has been shown to influence cognitive processing as in the joint Simon effect (Dolk et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Sebanz, Knoblich, &#x00026; Prinz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>), joint flanker effect (Atmaca, Sebanz, &#x00026; Knoblich, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>) and the joint implicit attitude task (Stenzel &#x00026; Liepelt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>). The most relevant finding is the face/agent interference effect identifed by Baess and Prinz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>), who presented a black or white dot superimposed on a face and required participants to respond to the color of the dot. Faster responses were observed when the background was the participant&#x02019;s own face, rather than another&#x02019;s face. Although this own-face advantage was significantly bigger in a joint action setting (when participants responded to one color and the other color was taken care of by a co-actor) than an individual action setting (when participants responded to one color and ignored the other color), the small reaction time difference (i.e. 3&#x02009;ms) indicated that the effect (if it really exists) is weak. This leads us to speculate that the joint action effect on identity referential information is either small in nature or too weak to be detected with the current paradigm, or is exempted.</p><p id="Par33">Studies have shown that the social states of co-actors modulated self&#x02013;other integration. A positive relationship enhances the joint Simon effect (Hommel, Colzato, &#x00026; Van Den Wildenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>; M&#x000fc;ller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>), and a competitive relationship degrades it (Ruissen &#x00026; de Bruijn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). Future studies may consider creating cooperation or competition opportunities in addition to sitting participants who are co-performing the task side-by-side to allow a more visible influence from the joint action on the referential processing of different identities.</p><p id="Par34">To summarize experiments 1 and 2, we replicated the partner-advantage effect in different social contexts: partner-association was more accurately and quickly matched than stranger-association. This advantage is the same under individual and joint conditions, which suggests that joint action is not the major contributor. In experiment 2, two factors distinguished the roles of partner and neutral stranger: first, assignment as a partner enjoyed a social label that the neutral stranger&#x02019;s name did not have; second, participants briefly met their partners in person. Therefore, we tested whether physical presence was crucial in experiment 3 by pairing participants with a partner who never actually appeared.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Experiment 3</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Purpose</title><p id="Par35">This experiment aimed to investigate whether identity-advantage toward a stranger introduced as a partner in a joint task persists if the partner is physically absent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par36">Twenty-two additional students who did not participate in the previous experiments took part in this study (12 men and 10 women), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

The quick establishment of partner-advantage from a brief meeting lasting seconds and without any verbal communication is sufficient to create prioritized processing for a stranger, and its relatively quick reduction in time implies the plasticity of other-advantage. This suggests that identity-associated priority processing is richer than previously thought.</p><p id="Par65">Separate neural pathways have been reported to be involved in in the referential processing of self and others with familiarity and/or social significance as modulating factors. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a similar identity-shape matching task, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) were more activated for self-related stimuli, while the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was more activated for stranger-related stimuli (Sui, Rotshtein, &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>). Similar results were obtained in various identity-related tasks, such as trait, appearance, and mental state judgements. When we compare self with others (including celebrities and strangers), the vmPFC is more activated for a self-related process and the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) is more activated for an other-related process (see a meta-analysis and a review article: Denny, Kober, Wager, &#x00026; Ochsner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>; Wagner, Haxby, &#x00026; Heatherton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). A recent neural stimulation study suggested a causal role of dmPFC in self/other processing: excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in dmPFC removed the self-advantage over another person (Barack Obama) in a referential memory task (Martin, Dzafic, Ramdave, &#x00026; Meinzer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>). Moreover, familiarity and social significance modulates brain activation levels. In a task where the participants made trait judgements for self, significant others (mother) and familiar celebrities who shared little personal history with the participants (e.g. former U.S. Presidents), the vmPFC activation level recorded by fMRI was highest for self (where the familiarity and social significance with self is at its highest), medium for significant others, and lowest for unfamiliar others (with whom we are least familiar and where the social significance is lowest) (Krienen, Tu, &#x00026; Buckner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>; Moran, Lee, &#x00026; Gabrieli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>). These findings suggest that the other-advantage involves an alternative neural pathway to self-advantage. However, whether these findings apply to a partner without prior familiarity, as in our study, is unknown.</p><p id="Par66">The partner-advantage might be served by a separate mechanism from advantage processing for information associated with self and significant others (i.e. friends, mothers). Several signature observations from our results imply a significant qualitative difference in the effect toward a newly met stranger. First, the brevity of the encounter rules out the involvement of accumulated familiarity, which is a shared feature in advantage processing for self and significant others. This is the first report to show that identity referential salience can be quickly established toward an unfamiliar stranger. Second, the temporal window of processing in our results suggested that the most critical window for initiating a deeper level of processing with a partner in a perceptual matching task was at the beginning. The difference between partner and stranger gradually reduced and became insignificant, while the difference between self/friend and stranger remained robust. We notice that this trend at block 3 mainly came from the performance improvement in stranger trials as the partner and the best friend stimuli are almost responded to at the ceiling level. It is important to be reminded that the identify advantage in the research community is defined as a relative strength between self/significant others/partner and stranger. The establishment of bias can come from the performance increase from self/significant others/partner trials or from the performance reduction in stranger trials or from both. The two sources may be served by different neural mechanisms that are non-separable&#x000a0;in current study. It will be an interesting direction to experimentally disentangle these two sources in future studies. In other words, the advantage quickly decreased over time and did not survive for long in the same way as the self/friend-advantage. This implied that the advantage might depend on short-lived neural circuits designed to respond to a new social situation. In addition, prolonged exposure or an opportunity to co-act in a joint task did not further strengthen the effect, which is opposite to what one would expect from the learning effect. To sum up, it is plausible to assume that these distinctions require a different component to account for the relationship involved in a longer personal history (e.g. self and significant others).</p><p id="Par67">What might be a possible platform for such quickly established selectivity?

In the current study (experiments 1, 2, 4, and 5), the introduction is long enough to allow participants to create an impression from the partners&#x02019; appearance and nonverbal cues (eye contact, facial expression, and body language).</p><p id="Par68">The amygdala and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were previously identified as crucial for forming first impressions from faces and verbal descriptions (Schiller, Freeman, Mitchell, Uleman, &#x00026; Phelps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009</xref>). In particular, the amygdala is associated with the processing of nonverbal personal information such as facial and body movements; while the PCC responds to verbal information such as descriptions of one&#x02019;s social behaviors (Kuzmanovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). In addition to being an important contributor to the other-referential advantage, the dmPFC is also involved in impression formation. A transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study (Ferrari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>) showed that the dmPFC played a crucial role in integrating impressions obtained from nonverbal and verbal stimuli. The participants first used verbal descriptions to form positive or negative impressions of faces, and they judged whether a new adjective fitted the impressions. Responses slowed when participants received TMS over the dmPFC, compared with TMS over the inferior frontal gyrus or over a control site (vertex). Interestingly, no impairment effect from TMS was observed when impressions were formed from face or verbal description alone. This study indicated that the mechanisms of impression formation for facial and verbal information were disassociated. The processing advantage in the present study was established between participants who met briefly without any verbal communication. More effort is needed to explore whether the partner-advantage has a neural network that overlaps with the impression formation of nonverbal stimuli.</p><p id="Par69">From the depth-of-processing perspective (Baddeley &#x00026; Woodhead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1982</xref>; Craik &#x00026; Tulving, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1975</xref>), we speculate that the additional information obtained from first impressions can induce partner name processing at a deeper level than stranger names. It is reported that facial memory can be enhanced by deeper levels of processing, for example in visual imagery (Swann &#x00026; Miller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1982</xref>), providing contextual and personality information (Baddeley &#x00026; Woodhead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1982</xref>), and trait and facial physical feature judgments (Parkin &#x00026; Hayward, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1983</xref>). Deeper processing also promotes identity referential information coding such as evidence showing that name-face association is improved by deeper semantic processing (Troyer, H&#x000e4;fliger, Cadieux, &#x00026; Craik, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2006</xref>), visual imagery, and affective judgments (Yesavage, Rose, &#x00026; Bower, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1983</xref>). Face-related processing is involved in these previous results, which provided a possible candidate to illustrate why a brief physical presence is sufficient to evoke deeper processing in name-shape association in the current study.</p><p id="Par70">Other possible candidates for generating the partner-advantage effect may include memory structure, social facilitation, peer pressure, or social bonding. It has been suggested that self-related memory includes contributions from autobiographical knowledge and hierarchical structure, and the frequent use of self-related information generates quick access to memory structures and efficient coding (Conway &#x00026; Pleydell-Pearce, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Symons &#x00026; Johnson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1997</xref>). Similar benefits may be exerted on the partnership relationship and future investigations are needed to elucidate this possibility. Cognitive performance, as in the Stroop task, is improved with the presence of an audience, even when the audience is invisible (Huguet, Galvaing, Monteil, &#x00026; Dumas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1999</xref>). Similarly, a participant sitting next to another person performing a similar task can have a beneficial effect on performance compared with a person acting alone (B&#x000f6;ckler, Knoblich, and Sebanz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>), possibly through shared attention and social bonding (Wolf, Launay, and Dunbar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2016</xref>). Identity-related bias in shape-matching tasks has long been assumed to occur during perceptual selection (Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>; Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>) until a recent study demonstrated that there is also a decision-level origin (Macrae, Visokomogilski, Golubickis, Cunningham, and Sahraie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). Social facilitation might be a constituent part of this process, but it is unlikely to be the main modulator because social presence should enhance the overall task performance, which includes all identities. There has been no report on selective facilitation caused by identity to the best of our knowledge, and it will require additional investigations to clarify the role from social facilitation.</p><p id="Par71">In our experiments, we controlled the frequency effect by ensuring that our name choices of &#x0201c;partner&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;stranger&#x0201d; were novel to all the participants (i.e. they did not know anyone with this name). We also used two-character-names to control word length in the current study. Similarly, we drew the conclusion that the processing advantage we observed was not induced by the physical attributions of identity-associated labels.</p><p id="Par72">The current study suggests directions for a further exploration of beneficial processing for non-self-identities. To test whether other-advantage is modulated by the depth of processing, future manipulations of partner-related identity can include information from shallow level processing such as profile photos to deep level processing such as personality trait judgment. Another intriguing direction would be to distinguish and associate two contributors for referential processing: social significance and familiarity. Our result from named-partner trials suggested that its benefit over a stranger-trial decays quickly. This implies that the familiar identity advantage must have been established via a different route. The interplay between social significance and familiarity warrants a closer examination of how they independently and interactively modulate the identity-related advantage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec34"><p>
