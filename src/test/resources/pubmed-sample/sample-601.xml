These approaches preclude the notion of a direct proportional relationship between changes in transcriptomic and proteomic expression in disease, for example. While this may be correct, it has also been demonstrated that it may not always be the case, even for single cell expression under normal circumstances, as these correlations may be influenced by a number of factors, including half-lives of the entity expression or post transcriptional machinery[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides, in some animal disease models, bias in their correlation with clinical traits has been observed in which transcript levels appeared to correlate more strongly than protein levels [<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Such discrepancies are likely to bear significant relevance for cardiovascular disease pathways leading to heart failure, including cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic heart diseases, whose underlying pathways remain elusive. However, the relationship between transcript and protein levels in disease processes has not been comprehensively studied yet. On the other hand, establishing concordant proportional alterations in transcripts and proteins in a disease should be more informative and greatly enhance the deciphering of the contributing mechanisms. Specifically, despite great efforts to comprehend the underlying mechanism(s) involved in the progression of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) to overt heart failure, the primary triggers for the disease remain largely undeciphered. DCM is a manifestation of the thinning of one or both ventricle(s) from an unknown cause leading to impaired cardiac contractility and therefore, overt congestive heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias. It presents an end product of myocardial damage triggered by a variety of factors such as toxic, metabolic or infectious agents, but may also be triggered by mutations in genes encoding various cardiac-related proteins[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The consequence of these manifestations is heart failure associated with a gradual increase in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, wall thinning and alteration in the shape of the chambers to a more spherical and less elongated form, termed left ventricular remodeling[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this process, several molecular and cellular alterations including those in the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) homeostasis, cyclic AMP-dependent pathways, neurohumoral activation and myofibrillar function contribute to cardiac muscle contractility and relaxation abnormalities[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Available evidence also implicates diverse pathways, such as, the vascular renin&#x02013;angiotensin system, G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors, TGF&#x003b2;-activin-A/Smad signaling pathway, SH2-containing cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase (Shp) and apoptotic signaling[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], among others, in the progression of DCM to overt heart failure. Hence, DCM is a product of interplay of changes in various interrelated signalling networks that in turn trigger multiple events in the progression to overt heart failure.</p><p>Recently, we and other laboratories have reported left ventricular transcriptome expression profiling in human DCM[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, because of possible variabilities which may influence either transcriptome or proteome expression, the main question remains as to whether changes in these entities are congruent with each other. In order to test this notion, in the present study, we elected to investigate both global gene and protein expression in DCM from the same human left ventricular cardiac tissue harvested from identical points, employing the ABI high-density oligonucleotide microarray for the transcriptome expression profiling and the One-Dimensional Nano Acquity liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry on Synapt G2 system for the proteome profiling. Deciphering of such correlation patterns of alterations in transcriptional and proteomic expression should provide a valuable translational basis for elucidating some of the mechanisms involved in this vicious circle, possibly leading to the discovery of potential disease biomarkers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study patients</title><p>For the expression experiments, 300 mg of tissue were harvested from left ventricles of five DCM hearts excised from patients (3 male and 2 female; 42.3&#x000b1;6.3 years) with end-stage heart failure undergoing cardiac transplantation at our institution and five non-failing (NF) hearts procured from organ donors (three male and two female; 34.1&#x000b1;4.7 years) who died of traffic accidents with no history of cardiac disease serving as controls. All samples were procured from identical myocardial loci as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Fully informed written consent was obtained from all patients or family members before participating in the study, which was approved by the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre Ethics Committee. This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki as adopted and promulgated by the US National Institutes of Health as well as rules and regulations laid down by King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Array hybridization and transcriptome data analysis</title><p>Whole genome left ventricular gene expression profiling was performed using Applied Biosystems (ABI) human array ver.2, which contains 31,700 sixty-mer oligonucleotide probes, representing 27,868 individual human genes. Total RNA was extracted and purified from the left ventricular biopsies using Totally RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Scientitific, Foster City, CA, USA), and quantified with the NanoDrop<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA was further inspected with RNA 6000 Nano Assay kit using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). High quality RNA (1 &#x003bc;g of RNA that has integrity number 8 and above) was used to generate cRNA that was labeled with Digoxigenin-UTPs using Chemiluminescent RT-IVT Labeling Kit v 1.0 (Applied Biosystems). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the arrays for 16 h at 55&#x000b0;C. The arrays were washed and placed into the microarray analyzer for image acquisition. The preliminary data analysis based on image quality was performed on ABI 1700 Chemiluminescent Microarray Analyzer (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). Array hybridization and data analysis were performed as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, data normalization and identification of differentially expressed genes was accomplished using Bioconductor packages (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA) and Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc.). Thereby, genes exhibiting p&#x0003c;0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% and the absolute fold changes (FC)&#x0003e;1.5 were considered significantly modulated.

Several mRNA and protein species were differentially expressed in DCM compared to non-failing left ventricular heart tissues. A large number of the upregulated entities and pathways belonged to families involved in cardiomyocyte contractility, cell survival, cell cycle and energy metabolic patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3), processes, as indicated by the abundance of altered ATP, ATPases and mitochondrial enzyme activities. Functionally, by far the greatest majority of these entities belong to a spectrum of enzyme families mediating a variety of activities, including DNA/RNA regulation/processing, cellular metabolism, cell cycle control and homeostasis, whose cardiac-related functions remain largely obscure. Hence, our data furnishes compelling evidence for the marked changes in metabolic and stress response processes in DCM that still need to be deciphered.</p><p>Of particular interest was the observation that only a few of the most significantly up/downregulated proteins such as the superoxide dismutase (SOD2), HSP90AA1 or GOT1, could be allotted a cardiac-related function, or may have been implicated in cardiovascular disease thus far. Among these, the SOD2, which is thought to play a role in resisting external superoxide stress, acid tolerance and acid-adaptive response, has been associated with various diseases, including DCM, sporadic motor neuron disease and cancer[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while an increase in the HSP90AA1 activity may represent a response to ischemia and reperfusion injury[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], for example. The GOT1 acts as a scavenger of glutamate in brain neuroprotection and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury and increased myocardial antioxidant capacity in rats [<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, many of the differentially expressed proteins have not been linked to DCM yet, but rather implicated in diverse processes whose relationship to cardiovascular function remains to be elucidated. These include the HSP90AB1, UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoyl glucosamine reductase (MURB), EFTU), neutral alpha-glucosidase C (GANC), VG03, early response growth protein and leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (LRRK1), all of which showed a 10-fold change in DCM. Thus, for example, the FAD cofactor MURB is involved in cell wall formation and biogenesis as well as peptidyl glycan biosynthesis pathways, EFTU is thought to be involved in mitochondrial translation and translational elongation, organelle organization, and BDH1 believed to be involved in cellular ketone body metabolic biosynthesis, catabolic processes as well as cellular lipid and small molecule metabolism. However, currently there is lack of information regarding their potential role in cardiovascular function. Besides, several other significantly altered proteins (&#x0003e;5-fold) including ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 2 (ANKR2), Ig kappa chain V-I region Rei (KV115), hemoglobin beta chain (HBB), DENN domain-containing protein 5A (DEN5A), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (<italic>PNPLA3)</italic>, tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase [NAD(P)(<sup>+</sup>)]-like isoform 3 (DUS3L), appear not only to be even further remotely linked to classical cardiovascular functionality, but also to await full characterization in humans. Having said that, their down-/upregulation indeed points to their potential involvement in cardiomyocyte modification(s) as an integral component of events occurring in DCM. Therefore, in-depth studies are necessary to ascertain the actual role of these diverse, yet to be deciphered transcriptome and proteome changes in DCM pathways. Understandably, several modest changes in many other proteins were also observed commensurate with classically expected changes in DCM and heart failure. Thus, although these alterations may occur independently of the underlying disease etiology, it is also known that the greater part of myocardial changes is triggered by chronic neurohumoral activation and abnormal mechanical load[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hence, these manifestations may constitute components of the biological processes involving these changes, which probably form part of a vicious circle that enhances the progression of heart failure, a subject that continues to attract focused research attention.</p><p>Interestingly, at least ten of the entities displaying significant differential expression between disease and controls exhibited similar trends in their expression on the two platforms. One of these, the SLC25A11, plays an important role in several metabolic processes and appears to be downregulated in ischemic stroke[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another entity displaying similar tendencies, the HSPA5, probably plays a role in facilitating the assembly of multimeric protein complexes inside the endoplasmic reticulum, and may be required for the correct protein folding and misfolded protein degradation. However, no relationship to disease has been established yet for these interactions. The NDUFV1 constitutes a core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) belonging to the minimal assembly required for catalysis in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain, and has recently been implicated in DCM[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] as well as remodeling in ischemic heart failure[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. PDHB forms part of a complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>, thereby linking the glycolytic pathway to the tricarboxylic cycle. Such concomitant alterations in transcriptome and proteome expression constitutes a potential platform for defining markers for DCM, calling for further efforts to be exploited in this direction. Furthermore, the COX17 has been implicated in various processes including brain and heart development, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and its deficiency has been associated with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. DCN is a putative currently uncharacterized protein that has been linked to skeletal muscle tissue development, response to aging, kidney development and wound healing. It is thought to be involved in cardiac remodelling[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and to contribute to attenuating the progression of atherosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The SLC25A13 catalyzes the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exchange of cytoplasmic glutamate with mitochondrial aspartate across the mitochondrial inner membrane, and may have a function in the urea cycle, while TPP1 is a lysosomal serine protease whose mRNA expression is increased during exercise and training and linked to ageing process[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Mutations in the gene have been associated with various diseases.</p><p>Thus, our study demonstrated that multiple interlinked processes are indeed involved in the pathways to DCM and exudes the power of transcriptome expression and label-free expression proteomics towards biomarker discovery for DCM. Accordingly, it is anticipated that combinations of different analysis platforms, rather than use of a single method, would render themselves more reliable to answer complex biological questions. However, while great enhancement of our understanding of differential gene and protein expression has been made possible through the advent of such microarray-based and similar techniques[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], it appears nonetheless that much more still needs to be leant about these techniques. Thus, apart from possible technically related uncertainties in sample preparation and reliability of the whole-genome analytical techniques especially for those entities displaying low expression levels, such differences may also be influenced by the signaling networks linked to their expression. In fact, the quality control test indicated that some of such changes eventually showed similar trends, suggesting in deed that these dissimilarities might have been due to technical inconsistencies. Besides, a validation analysis with other data sets using a different microarray platform demonstrated great concordance of our results. Notably also, GO analyses of the DEGs and DEPs revealed significant overlap with enrichment of genes/proteins related to many processes including not only those that are likely to be altered in the progression of DCM to overt heart failure, but are also linked to other disease such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) for example, which strengthens the notion that these two diseases might share some common pathway that need to be deciphered[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, our approach produced comparatively reliable and informative results with the array platforms employed, especially if considered together with similar gene expression by different platforms[<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162669.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Hence, clinically useful inferences continue to be derived from such studies.</p><p>In summary, the concomitant employment of transcriptome and proteome expression to evaluate alterations in DCM in the present study led to the identification of sixteen commonly altered entities, providing further insight into the mechanism of heart muscle disease pathways. It also led to the identification of novel entities and pathways whose cardiac functions have yet to be deciphered. Together with an integration of clinical and biochemical information, this data should contribute towards better management of the disease. Importantly also, the resemblance of DCM with disorders, such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders, in the pattern of differential expression of several proteins, molecular functions and pathways also reveals a potential link of these diseases at the level of energy metabolism and maintenance of cellular structural integrity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162669.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Principal Component Analysis using the 268 identified proteins with significant difference in expression (combined P&#x0003c; 0.05, 1.5-Fold change and Power 0.9) between left ventricles of DCM and control samples.</title><p>Their expression changes allow for clear separation into two distinct sample groups.
