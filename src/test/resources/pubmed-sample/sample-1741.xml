Cells from HGPS patients accumulate progerin, a permanently farnesylated, toxic form of Lamin A, disrupting the nuclear shape and chromatin organization, leading to DNA-damage accumulation and senescence. Therapeutic approaches targeting farnesylation or aiming to reduce progerin levels have provided only partial health improvements. Recently, we identified Remodelin, a small-molecule agent that leads to amelioration of HGPS cellular defects through inhibition of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10). Here, we show the preclinical data demonstrating that targeting NAT10 in vivo, either via chemical inhibition or genetic depletion, significantly enhances the healthspan in a <italic>Lmna</italic><sup><italic>G609G</italic></sup> HGPS mouse model.

Key factors for NE function as a compartmental border are the nuclear lamins, scaffold proteins that specify nuclear architecture and provide mechanical strength to the nucleus and the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Notably, over the past few years, lamins have emerged as significant players in many other critical cellular functions, including differentiation, intracellular signaling, chromatin organization, transcription, as well as DNA replication and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In mammals, the nuclear lamins are categorized in two distinct classes: A-type lamins (Lamin A, Lamin C, Lamin C2, and Lamin A&#x00394;10; all encoded by the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene) and B-type lamins (Lamin B1 encoded by <italic>LMNB1</italic>, and Lamin B2 that, together with Lamin B3, are encoded by the <italic>LMNB2</italic> gene)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In accord with their important roles, the loss-of-function mutations in lamin genes result in genetic syndromes with severe presentations called laminopathies (OMIM #150330; #150340; #150341). These include muscular dystrophies (for example, Emery-Dreyfus Muscular Dystrophy), peripheral neuropathies (for example, Charcot-Marie Tooth-Disease), leukodystrophy, lipodystrophy, as well as premature aging (progeria) syndromes, such as Atypical Werner Syndrome (AWS), Restrictive Dermopathy (RD), and Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Of all these syndromes, HGPS is the one with the most striking presentation. After onset, usually within the first year of life, HGPS patients start to display short stature, low body weight (BW), hair loss, lipodystrophy, scleroderma, decreased mobility and osteoporosis, as well as facial features that resemble accelerated aspects of normal ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While the cognitive development is normal, cardiovascular abnormalities&#x02014;characterized by medial smooth-muscle cell loss and secondary maladaptive vascular remodeling (intimal thickening, disrupted elastin fibers, and deposition of atherosclerotic plaques)&#x02014;are the main reasons for death, with the median life expectancy at birth for HGPS patients being 14.6 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">HGPS arises from a heterozygous G608G point mutation of <italic>LMNA</italic> exon 11, leading to cryptic mRNA splicing and expression of a shorter, dysfunctional form of Lamin A, called progerin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Similar to wild-type Lamin A, progerin undergoes several post-translational modifications, including the addition of a farnesyl group required for its targeting to the nuclear envelope. However, unlike Lamin A, progerin remains permanently farnesylated, causing it to accumulate on the inner nuclear membrane. In HGPS cells, progerin acts as a dominant-negative protein, aggregating the wild-type lamins, disrupting nuclear shape and chromatin organization, and leading to the increased genomic instability and rapid cell senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although farnesyl transferase inhibition (FTI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> is being explored as a therapeutic approach for HGPS and has provided certain health improvements in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, there is a clear need for additional therapeutic regimes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, we discovered that a small-molecule compound, which we named Remodelin, can ameliorate HGPS cellular phenotypes. Remodelin acts in a progerin- and FTI-independent pathway, by targeting and inhibiting the N-acetyltransferase NAT10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Here, we assess NAT10 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for HGPS by using an established mouse model (<italic>Lmna&#x02014;G609G</italic> allele) that exhibits premature-aging phenotypes similar to those of HGPS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Critical for translating NAT10 inhibition toward human patients, we show that chemical or genetic targeting of NAT10 decreases the genomic instability, and improves age-related phenotypes of both homozygous and heterozygous HGPS mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Remodelin ameliorates age-dependent weight loss in HGPS mice</title><p id="Par6">To determine the effects of Remodelin on HGPS mouse cells, we derived skin fibroblasts from <italic>Lmna</italic><sup><italic>G609G/G609G</italic></sup> and wild-type (WT) littermates.

The complex nature of this segmental syndrome makes it difficult to target therapeutically, with standard therapeutic approaches mainly aiming at preventing the expression or the accumulation of progerin on the nuclear envelope. Thus, strategies that have so far received most attention largely involve the targeting enzymes participating in the progerin pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, including HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase, farnesyl transferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase, as well as modulating <italic>Lmna</italic> pre-mRNA splicing by morpholino compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Because FTI treatment is now essentially standard-of-care and the HGPS patient population is small (~1 in 18 million)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, further clinical trials will likely be arranged as combined therapies with lonafarnib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Our results show that NAT10 genetic depletion or its chemical inhibition by the compound Remodelin lead to healthspan enhancements&#x02014; as indicated by effects on age-dependent BW loss, cardiac function, back curvature, fitness, and genomic instability&#x02014;in both homozygous and heterozygous HGPS mice, through a mechanism that appears to be independent of progerin. Reinforcing our conclusions, we have recently carried out further studies with a Remodelin derivative, Remodelin-fluor (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>), that in HGPS cells showed the same effect as Remodelin at half the Remodelin dose (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref>). Using this compound in mice, we observed hair graying (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10c</xref>) and no drug-induced weight loss (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10d</xref>). Moreover, Remodelin-fluor treatment led to a significant decrease in the timeframe of body-weight loss along with 30% increase in Kaplan&#x02013;Meier area under the curve for treated mice, as compared to vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10e</xref><italic>;</italic> Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). While we did not see Remodelin-induced effects on low mineral density and bone mineral content in HGPS mice (see Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">3</xref>), we observed significant disease amelioration by Remodelin treatment and <italic>Nat10</italic> genetic depletion in critical organs, such as the heart. Notably, these cardiovascular effects were not only restricted to the aorta, but also included impacts on other large vessels of the heart, such as the coronary arteries. These effects are of potential clinical relevance because advanced coronary disease is prevalent in HGPS patients, even in the absence of high blood pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We also note that, in contrast to FTI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, Remodelin decreases markers of genome instability in HGPS cells and organs. We showed in our previous work that combining FTI and Remodelin in HGPS patient cells does not improve the cellular phenotypes further, compared to Remodelin alone (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref> of Larrieu et al., Science 2014<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). However, as they act in different pathways, it is possible that the phenotypes in vivo would benefit from the drug combination, which will likely be the scope of ensuing studies.</p><p id="Par19">Collectively, our data thus highlights the potential for NAT10 inhibitors in treating HGPS in combination with lonafarnib, where additive therapeutic effects might be anticipated. While we found that complete <italic>Nat10</italic> deletion resulted in early embryonic lethality in mice, <italic>Nat10</italic> haploinsufficiency or chemical inhibition via Remodelin treatment did not confer any profound side effects. Because NAT10 is a 115&#x02009;kDa protein with multiple functional domains, it could be that the lethality associated with its total loss is linked to another aspect of the NAT10 protein, other than its N-acetyltransferase function. In this regard, we note that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a null allele of NAT10, <italic>nath-10</italic>(<italic>tm2624</italic>), causes fully penetrant embryonic lethality in the homozygous state. By contrast, the <italic>nath-10</italic>(<italic>N2</italic>) hypomorphic allele, containing a polymorphism in the N-acetyltransferase domain, did not cause pathology in a homozygous setting, but instead conferred increased fitness and a strong competitive advantage over WT animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. While these and our data are encouraging from the perspective of considering NAT10 inhibition as a therapeutic approach for HGPS, the fact that our understanding of NAT10 biology is still in its infancy means that any clinical studies should be explored with caution.</p><p id="Par20">The small number of HGPS patients and the diverse nature of their pathologies provide challenges for the evaluation of potentially new HGPS therapies in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. If NAT10 inhibitors are explored in clinical settings, it will thus be extremely valuable to assess target engagement. In this regard, it will be of interest to investigate the potential of the gene-expression signatures that we have found to be associated with HGPS cells, and which are rebalanced toward WT profiles by either Remodelin treatment or NAT10 depletion. Furthermore, our data suggests that acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin lysine 40 (K40), a known NAT10 target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, might also be used as a readout for NAT10 inhibition in cells and in vivo. These findings also correlated with our previous data, indicating that NAT10 inhibition ameliorates HGPS cellular phenotypes, at least in part, by mediating microtubule destabilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation at K40 is elevated in HGPS tissues and the cells are compared to controls, it will be of interest to explore whether this could be used to monitor disease progression and also enhance our understanding of disease pathobiology. Finally, we speculate that because the hallmarks of HGPS are present at lower levels in the vasculature and other tissues of aged-normal individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, NAT10 targeting might offer therapeutic opportunities in broader settings. In accord with such a possibility, we have recently reported the effects of NAT10 inhibition in normally aged smooth muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, that might suggest the potential for NAT10 inhibition in the context of normal ageing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis of Remodelin and derivatives</title><p id="Par21">All solvents and reagents were purified using standard techniques, or used as supplies from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich).

Factors predicted to affect the variables were standardized where possible. If this was not possible, measures were taken to reduce potential bias. For example, the impact of different people performing the test was minimized (known as the &#x0201c;minimized operator&#x0201d;) as defined in the Mouse Experimental Design Ontology (MEDO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

In addition, pre-established reasons were defined for QC failures (e.g., insufficient sample, error with equipment during test) and detailed using IMPRESS. This provides standardized options and criteria as agreed by area experts as to when data can be discarded. All discarded data is retained and tracked in a database to allow QC-failed data to be audited. Phenotyping data are collected at regular intervals on age, sex, and strain-matched wildtype (control) mice. In total, at least seven homozygote mice of each sex per knockout line were generated for phenotyping. If no homozygotes were obtained from &#x02265;28 offspring from heterozygote intercrosses at P14, the line was declared homozygous lethal. Similarly, if less than 13% of the pups resulting from intercrossing were homozygous survive to P14, the line was judged as being homozygous subviable. In this event, heterozygote mice were examined in the phenotyping screen. The random allocation of mice to experimental group (wildtype vs. knockout) was driven by Mendelian Inheritance. Because of the high-throughput nature of the phenotyping screen, blinding the operators to the identity of knockout lines (both which line to be studied and the zygosity of the individual mouse) during phenotyping was not employed as the cage cards used to identify the mice includes genotype information. However, in a high throughput environment without a defined hypothesis, the potential bias is minimized. In all cases, the individual mouse was considered the experimental unit.

No mice were excluded from study on this basis. Mice were anaesthetized with 110&#x02009;mg/kg BW ketamine and 11&#x02009;mg/kg BW xylazine given intraperitoneally. Mice were then imaged sequentially with three modalities, high resolution X-Ray imaging (MX-20, Faxitron, Tucson, AZ), Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry for body composition (Piximus II, GE Healthcare, Hatfield, UK), and with light photography for imaging of dysmorphology. A whole-body lateral image using the MX-20 was collected for the analysis of spinal curvature by trained persons using a standard defined position to minimize inconsistencies between mice.

All ECG recording sessions were performed during daytime and the data analyzed using the <italic>iox2</italic>, data acquisition, and analysis software (emka TECHNOLOGIES). Each animal was put inside the tunnel, which was then closed, ensuring the animal was properly restrained. To minimize the effects of stress, animals were allowed to stay in the restraining system for 1&#x02009;min before starting ECG recordings. Indeed, direct observation of the animals and ECG traces proved that they were calm and that the heart rate was stable. For data acquisition, a series of repeated measurements were done on the same animal at each time-point and data for the same animal was collected over the different week intervals. For the data collected on the heart rate screen, a multilevel regression model was performed using R (package:nlme version 3.1). A model [Eq.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>], treating genotype, sex, and age as fixed effects whilst the repeat measure nature of the dataset was accounted for by treating each mouse as a random effect, was fitted to the data.

Because of financial constrains we used <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 mice/group. Transcriptome data was obtained using paired end sequencing, with read lengths of 150&#x02009;bp, on a NextSeq 500 machine. Trimmed reads were aligned using STAR aligner (version 2.4.2a) to the mouse genome assembly GRCm38. Normalization of the read counts and differential expression analysis was performed using three commonly used software programs: DeSeq2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and Cuffdiff 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Our conservative approach defined genes differentially expressed as those found to be in common between the results of at least two of the three software programs mentioned above.

DeSeq2 and edgeR used as an input raw read counts produced by featureCounts from the Bioconductor (version 3.3) Rsubread package (14) in R version 3.3.1. For the DeSeq2 and edgeR analyzes, we filtered out genes that had 0 or 1 read support across all samples. In the DeSeq2 differential expression analysis, we selected genes that were up or down regulated at a FDR lower than 0.1. In edgeR differential expression analysis, we selected genes up or down regulated with a <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05. Gene ontology analysis was performed using the mouse genome informatics visual annotation display<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.
