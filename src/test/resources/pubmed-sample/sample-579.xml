Compared to values obtained in rats exposed to cadmium, cytological analysis indicated a significant decrease of total cell and neutrophil counts and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in rats pretreated with tiotropium (70&#x003bc;g/15ml or 350&#x003bc;g/15ml). Zymographic tests showed a decrease of MMP-2 activity in BALF in rats pretreated only with high concentration of tiotropium. Histological examination revealed a significant decrease of the severity and extent of inflammatory lung injuries in rats pretreated with both tested concentrations of tiotropium. Though tiotropium (70&#x003bc;g/15ml) or budesonide (250&#x003bc;g/15ml) could not reduce cadmium-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness, their combination significantly decreased bronchial contractile response to methacholine. These two drugs separately decreased the neutrophil number and protein concentration in BALF but no significant interaction was observed when both drugs were combined. Although no inhibitory effects on MMP-2 and MMP-9 was observed in rats pretreated with budesonide alone, the combination with the ineffective dose of tiotropium induced a significant reduction on these parameters. The inhibitory effect of tiotropium on lung injuries was not influenced by budesonide which alone induced a limited action on the severity and extent of inflammatory sites. Our findings show that tiotropium exerts anti-inflammatory effects on cadmium-induced acute neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation. The combination of tiotropium with budesonide inhibits cadmium-induced inflammatory injuries with a synergistic interaction on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and airway hyper-responsiveness.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 81373468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9673-1999</contrib-id><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wenhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81373468) to WZ.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow restriction, resulting a progressive irreversible decline in lung function [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Lung function and life quality become dramatically impaired in case of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) which become the main cause of high mortality and morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to clinical evidence, neutrophil recruitment is highly increased accompanied with bronchoconstriction during COPD exacerbations [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, seeking out the effective treatment to suppress neutrophilic infiltration will be helpful to control AECOPD.</p><p>According to GOLD, bronchodilators are recommended as the first line therapy in COPD [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These coumpounds can also exert anti-inflammatory properties. The anti-inflammatory effect of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) has been mentioned by several studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Tiotropium has been reported to have an anti-inflammatory activity on cigarette smoke induced pulmonary inflammation in mice [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and can inhibit cytokines production from structural and inflammatory cells [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, whether tiotropium could reduce the severity and frequency of AECOPD by inhibiting neutrophilic infiltration remains to be clarified.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are recommended to reduce the inflammation and control symptoms of AECOPD by GOLD [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but their therapeutic efficacy against inflammatory responses in patients with COPD is limited [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the risk of pneumonia may be increased due to the long-term use of ICS [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that the combination of an ICS with an anticholinergic agent can improve COPD patients' lung function, clinical symptoms, exercise tolerance and life quality [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In conscious guinea pigs, co-administration of budesonide with tiotropium exerted a significant protection against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, some studies mentioned no additional efficacy to reduce the incidence of AECOPD when tiotropium was added to ICS/long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist (LABA) [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It needs to clarify whether these combinations, especially LAMAs, could restore ICS insensitivity to well control the inflammatory responses and thereby reduce exacerbation rates of COPD.</p><p>Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor while air pollution and occupational exposure are also recognized as risk factors for COPD. Cadmium (Cd) consists one of tobacco components and can be inhaled by active or passive route through cigarette smoke. Several studies have mentioned that Cd could impair lung function and induce lung diseases involving neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our previous study, an acute exposure to Cd has been found to induce bronchoconstriction and neutrophilic infiltration associated with increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity which mimic some main features of AECOPD [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2 and MMP-9 are considered as markers of acute lung inflammation. Evidence has highlighted that inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 provides a protective effect against acute lung injuries [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The effect of ICS on MMPs activity seems controversial but it has been suggested that the low potency of ICS to decrease MMPs activity may be partially responsible of their lack of efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some studies have revealed the inhibitory effect of anticholinergics on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interactions between these compounds at this level is not documented.</p><p>By using the model of acute pulmonary inflammation induced by a single inhalation of Cd in rats, the aim of this study was to investigate whether tiotropium could exert its anti-inflammatory effect and restore budesonide insensitivity against Cd-induced acute neutrophilic inflammation. We also examined whether the expected protective effects were associated with a modulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in the present model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats (n = 68) weighing 200-250g were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co.

As one of tobacco components, Cd has been proved to induce acute lung injuries accompanied with an increase of inflammatory mediators and the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similar acute inflammatory pathological changes associated with airway hyperresponsiveness were observed in the present rat model. As a toxic heavy metal, Cd has pro-inflammatory properties and can induce the inflammatory responses through several mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Activation, desquamation and necrosis of epithelial cells may be involved and associated to cytokines and chemokines release [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Direct neutrophil activation by Cd has also been reported [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Investigation of these mechanisms was out of the scope of this paper. The aim was to explore the pharmacological modulation of tiotropium alone or in combination with budesonide on major inflammatory markers induced by cadmium. Although not been a perfect model of AECOPD, inhalation of Cd in rats can be considered relevant to mimic the main features of AECOPD and be suitable for the research of the mechanism of AECOPD and to investigate the effects of pharmacological agents.</p><p>As the first-line treatment of COPD, tiotropium has been reported to effectively improve lung function and quality of life, as well as reduce hospitalization rate by inhibiting bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, tiotropium has been reported to prevent tracheal hypercontractility in ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, the high concentration of tiotropium was found in the present study to exert a protective effect against Cd-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Besides the blockage of M3 receptor which gives rise to the bronchodilation, more attention has been paid to the anti-inflammatory effects of muscarinic antagonists [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Several studies <italic>in vitro</italic> also showed that tiotropium could suppress LPS-induced the release of neutrophil chemotactic mediators by human airway epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Together with the finding showing inhibitory effect of tiotropium on Cd-induced inflammatory changes in the present model, including a significant decrease of neutrophils and protein concentration in BALF accompanied with a marked attenuation of extent and severity of acute pulmonary inflammatory infiltration, we suggest that the decrease of airway hyperresponsiveness might be related to the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of tiotropium.</p><p>Although several mechanisms have been mentioned to explain the anti-inflammatory effects of tiotropium, the findings about the regulation of LAMA on MMP activity in acute lung injuries are quite limited at present. MMP-2 and MMP-9, mainly secreted by a wide variety of cells including alveolar epithelial cells, neutrophils and macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], are considered as markers of acute lung injuries and play a role in the inflammatory and remodeling process [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In a cigarette smoke-induced acute lung inflammation mouse model, glycopyrronium has been found to attenuate the elevated MMP-9 expression in lung tissue [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Asano <italic>et al</italic>. found that tiotropium inhibited the production of MMP-2 induced by TNF-&#x003b1; or TGF-&#x003b2; in lung fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The present study showed that the high concentration of tiotropium induced a significant reduction of MMP-2 activity in BALF. However, compared with the pronounced inhibitory effect of tiotropium on neutrophil count in BALF, tiotropium exerted only 10 to 15% inhibition of MMP-2 activity and was quite not effective on increased MMP-9 activity induced by Cd. These findings suggest that other mechanisms are also involved such as the inhibition of chemokine production by inflammatory cells [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While not be significant, the tendency of tiotropium to reduce Il-1&#x003b2; level suggest that this cytokine may be involved in the present model.</p><p>Known as a non-specific anti-inflammatory agent, ICSs exert anti-inflammatory effects against asthma and other inflammatory diseases. However, studies showed that ICSs were not so effective in suppressing the inflammatory pathological changes in patients with COPD, indicating that corticoids insensitivity is the main reason affecting the therapeutic efficacy in clinical treatment of COPD [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our previous studies showed that budesonide 500&#x003bc;g/15ml could significantly inhibit Cd-induced acute neutrophilic infiltration in lung tissue associated with a marked reduction of MMP-9 activity in BALF in the present rat model. However, the low concentration of budesonide (250&#x003bc;g/15ml) used in this study had a very limited anti-inflammatory efficacy without any significant impact on MMP-9 activity [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Evidence has revealed that LAMA elicited protective effects and reduced the incidence of acute exacerbation in patients with asthma who were resistant to ICS when it was used as an add-on therapy to ICS [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To observe the regulatory effects of the combination of a LAMA with an ICS on Cd-induced acute neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation, the low concentration of tiotropium (70&#x003bc;g/15ml) was administrated with budesonide (250&#x003bc;g/15ml). These low concentrations were selected in the present study in order to investigate relevant pharmacological concentrations with less additional side effects. Though tiotropium (70&#x003bc;g/15ml) or budesonide (250&#x003bc;g/15ml) could not reduce cadmium-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness, their combination elicited a significant decrease of E<sub>max.</sub> Additional and synergistic interactions were observed on MMPs activity. Similar result has been reported by the study of Perng <italic>et al</italic>. which showed an attenuation of the increased MMP-9 activity in induced sputum from patients with COPD when an ICS was combined with tiotropium [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The combination of both drugs exhibited inhibitory effects on neutrophil count and protein concentration in BALF. Cd-induced increase of severity and extent of lung injuries were also significantly reduced by the combination of both drugs, but no interaction was observed. Surprisingly, the combination of tiotropium with budesonide was slightly less efficient than tiotropium alone on inflammatory cell counts and protein concentration in BALF, but this difference was not significant. When compared the effects of the combination on lung tissue injuries and neutrophil infiltration in BALF, it appears that the impact on histological scores is higher than that on neutrophil count in BALF. This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that histological scores do not only reflect cell infiltration in lungs, but also edema and hemorrhage. On the other hand, recruitment and migration of neutrophils into inflamed lung tissue result in successive different steps, including release, adhesion and migration of neutrophils, modulated by several complex mechanisms differently modulated by pharmacological agents [<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193610.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193610.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This could explain why the number of neutrophils in BALF and the presence of neutrophils in lung tissue can be differently modulated by tiotropium and budesonide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, tiotropium exhibited its protective effect against Cd-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and acute neutrophilic inflammatory infiltration.
