If managed expectantly, it frequently progresses to endometrial carcinoma, rates of which are increasing dramatically worldwide. However, the established treatment for endometrial hyperplasia (progestogens) involves multiple side effects and leaves the risk of recurrence. Metformin is the most commonly used oral hypoglycaemic agent in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has also been linked to the reversal of endometrial hyperplasia and may therefore contribute to decreasing the prevalence of endometrial carcinoma without the fertility and side effect consequences of current therapies.

We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of use of metformin compared with a placebo or no treatment, conventional medical treatment (eg, progestogens) or any other active intervention. Two review authors will independently assess the trial eligibility, risk of bias and extract appropriate data points. Trial authors will be contacted for additional data.

It is thought to be due to unopposed, prolonged exposure of the endometrium to oestrogen; if managed expectantly, it can progress to endometrial carcinoma, although the condition may resolve spontaneously. It is diagnosed histologically and can be subsequently categorised into four subtypes: simple, simple with atypia, complex and complex with atypia.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Risk of progression to endometrial carcinoma is dependent on the type of endometrial hyperplasia, and progression rates vary widely across the literature. This discrepancy is likely due, in part, to the fact that many cases of endometrial hyperplasia, especially when atypia is present, are managed pre-emptively with a hysterectomy. However, atypia is thought to be a strong risk factor for progression to adenocarcinoma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Progression rates have been reported as &#x0003c;5% for non-atypical hyperplasia but 28% for atypical hyperplasia cumulatively over 20&#x02005;years. This difference in progression risk has also been seen at interval-specific time points of 4, 9 and 20&#x02005;years postdiagnosis.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia are, predictably, very similar to those for endometrial carcinoma and include obesity, diabetes mellitus, nulliparity, tamoxifen use, oestrogen therapy and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>PCOS is a metabolically driven gynaecological disorder thought to affect 10% of women of childbearing age.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A diagnosis of PCOS must fulfil the widely accepted Rotterdam criteria of two or more of the following in the absence of another cause of chronic anovulation: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), chronic oligo/anovulation and polycystic ovaries apparent on ultrasound.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia in women with PCOS varies greatly in the literature&#x02014;between 1% and 48.8%,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> but risk of endometrial carcinoma is well founded, as women with PCOS possess a threefold increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma when compared with the non-PCOS population.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The aim of endometrial hyperplasia treatment, whether or not PCOS is a comorbidity, is to control abnormal vaginal bleeding while minimising risk of progression to endometrial carcinoma. Historically, endometrial hyperplasia without atypia has been medically treated with oral progestogens (alone or in combination with oestrogen in PCOS) or intrauterine progestogens, inhibiting oestrogen-driven cell growth and inducing withdrawal bleeds.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This treatment provides the benefit of preserving fertility but is associated with side effects&#x02014;in the short term, headaches, mood changes, acne or breast tenderness, and over the longer term, risk of a thromboembolic event or breast cancer. These longer term side effects can be mitigated by educating women on the symptoms of thromboembolic events and by ensuring that they attend regular breast cancer screening programmes. This approach has the effect of potentially hindering compliance, consequently producing a relatively high relapse rate. In one study, 30.3% and 13.7% of women treated with oral progestogens and intrauterine levonorgestrel, respectively, had relapse of their endometrial hyperplasia.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In women with atypia and in those who are resistant to progestogens, surgical hysterectomy is the treatment of choice.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Description of the intervention</title><p>Metformin, a biguanide that acts as an insulin sensitiser, is the most commonly used oral hypoglycaemic agent in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It acts to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreasing liver glucose production and thereby decreasing levels of circulating glucose and insulin.</p><p>Metformin is also prescribed for women with PCOS to induce weight loss and improve menstrual regularity, both as monotherapy and in combination with a progestogen. It is frequently used to treat ovulation dysfunction in women with PCOS when they have shown resistance to treatment with clomiphene. Despite widespread use of metformin in women with PCOS, no definitive improvement in clinical or biochemical features has been shown on systematic review when metformin is compared with the contraceptive pill.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It has an established side effect profile, including nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and changes in taste, as well as rarer or less publicised effects including lactic acidosis or decreased B<sub>12</sub> absorption, possibly leading to anaemia and potentially irreversible neuronal damage if left unmonitored and uncorrected for prolonged periods.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>How the intervention might work</title><p>Hyperinsulinaemia secondary to insulin resistance is thought to exhibit a mitogenic effect, inducing cell division via mitosis&#x02014;a risk factor for hyperplasia&#x02014;and, ultimately, carcinoma development. This effect is likely due to its activity at the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, promoting proliferation and angiogenesis, which can be demonstrated by the positive correlation between diabetes and breast and gynaecological cancers.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Insulin-mediating effects of metformin, then, show evidence of reducing incidence and improving survival among these malignancies, although the evidence is mixed.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The link between insulin resistance and cell proliferation offers an intriguing potential therapeutic target to reverse hyperplasia and prevent endometrial carcinoma. Some early trials have corroborated this link, showing efficacy of metformin in inducing endometrial atrophy in benign endometrial proliferative disorders; one reported atrophy and, therefore, reversal of endometrial hyperplasia in 96% of women treated with metformin.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Other proposed mechanisms of the anticancer properties of metformin include its direct effects on cell signalling pathways, including inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt activity. These pathways are involved in cell proliferation and therefore play a key role in hyperplasia and cancerous lesions in any tissue. As metformin inhibits these pathways, cell proliferation will be hindered, reducing the chance of development of cancerous lesions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Why it is important to do this review</title><p>Current medical therapy for endometrial hyperplasia involves multiple side effects and leaves the risk of recurrence. Therefore, a systematic review of a novel, alternative therapy is needed to collate the evidence to date and guide future human trials. Risk of progression from endometrial hyperplasia to carcinoma is significant; up to 40% of women suffering from endometrial hyperplasia with atypia go on to develop carcinoma, the most common fatal gynaecological malignancy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This rate is expected to increase by up to 100% globally over the next 20&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The biguanide insulin sensitiser metformin has been linked to reversal of endometrial hyperplasia<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and, if it can be used in this way, may contribute to decreasing the prevalence of endometrial carcinoma without leading to the fertility consequences of current therapies. Metformin is also used as an alternative therapy in women with PCOS, among whom risk of endometrial hyperplasia is increased. However, the mode of action, efficacy and safety of metformin remain unclear. This review may help to clarify its role in the treatment of women with this disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objective</title><p>To determine the efficacy and safety of metformin in treating women with endometrial hyperplasia.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Criteria for considering studies for this review</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>Types of studies</title><p>The review will consider only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published and unpublished, as eligible for inclusion.

In this table, we will present a concise overview of the quality of available evidence pertaining to the review outcomes (regression of endometrial hyperplasia towards normal histology, recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia, progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer, hysterectomy rate, abnormal uterine bleeding, health-related quality of life, as reported in included studies and adverse effects during treatment as reported in included studies). In accordance with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) Working Group criteria (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias), we will rate the quality of the evidence as &#x02018;high&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate&#x02019;, &#x02018;low&#x02019; or &#x02018;very low&#x02019;.
