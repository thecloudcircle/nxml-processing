In this study, we show that nNOS activity is dynamically regulated by S-nitrosylation. We found that overexpressed nNOS in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells could be S-nitrosylated by exogenous NO donor GSNO and which is associated with the enzyme activity decrease. Cys<sup>331</sup>, one of the zinc-tetrathiolate cysteines, was identified as the key site of nNOS S-nitrosylation. In addition, we also found that nNOS is highly S-nitrosylated in resting rat hippocampal neurons and the enzyme undergos denitrosylation during the process of rat brain ischemia/reperfusion. Intrestingly, the process of nNOS denitrosylation is coupling with the decrease of nNOS phosphorylation at Ser<sup>847</sup>, a site associated with nNOS activation. Further more, we document that nNOS denitrosylation could be suppressed by pretreatment of neurons with MK801, an antagonist of NMDAR, GSNO, EGTA, BAPTA, W-7, an inhibitor of calmodulin as well as TrxR1 antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) respectively. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the denitrosylation of nNOS induced by calcium ion influx is a NMDAR-dependent process during the early stage of ischemia/reperfusion, which is majorly mediated by thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) system. nNOS dephosphorylation may be induced by the enzyme denitrosylation, which suggest that S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation of nNOS may be an important mechanism in regulating the enzyme activity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foudation of China (81271267; 31000360;), the Education Departmental Nature Science Funds of Jiangsu Province (10KJA310053), the Science and Technology Bureau of Xuzhou (XF10C077), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), the Qing Lan Project.

NO, as a reactive free radical gas, plays a vital role in regulating many physiological and pathophysiological processes <xref rid="pone.0052788-StuartSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052788-Andrew1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In addition to the classic activation of the c-GMP-dependent pathway, NO can also regulate many protein functions by means of a c-GMP-independent pathway, including those of the S-nitrosylating proteins <xref rid="pone.0052788-Stamler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052788-Jaffrey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The S-nitrosylation of protein thiols is a redox&#x02013;based post-translational modification that modulates protein function and activity <xref rid="pone.0052788-LpezSnchez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Many studies have now suggested that either exogenous or endogenous NO can S-nitrosylate cysteine residues <xref rid="pone.0052788-Jaffrey2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Both nNOS and iNOS are expressed in brain. iNOS is not normally present in healthy tissue, but is induced shortly after ischemia and contributes to secondary late-phase damage. nNOS is primarily expressed in neurons, where it mediates early neuronal injury <xref rid="pone.0052788-Amer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. As a constitutive 160-kDa protein as are the other NO synthase isoforms, nNOS functions as a dimer consisting of two identical monomers which link each other through a cysteine-complexed Zn<sup>2+</sup> at the dimer interface <xref rid="pone.0052788-Raman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052788-Kolodziejski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The monomer can be functionally divided into two major domains: a C-terminal reductase domain and an N-terminal oxygenase domain, between which there is a calmodulin (CaM) binding domain which is vital to both the structure and function of the enzyme <xref rid="pone.0052788-Andrew1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser<sup>847</sup> is induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK II) in the rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia <xref rid="pone.0052788-Osuka1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052788-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This decreases the activity of nNOS by inhibiting the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin. nNOS&#x003b1; harbors a PDZ domain at its N-terminus <xref rid="pone.0052788-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, through which postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) links nNOS with NMDAR to generate the NMDAR-PSD95-nNOS complex <xref rid="pone.0052788-Kornau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052788-Brenman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The NMDAR-PSD95-nNOS complex couples the activation of NMDAR to the production of NO and mediates NMDAR-dependent excitotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0052788-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The excessive activation of glutamate receptors is the principle reason for the neuronal death that occurs in ischemic stroke as NMDAR has a higher calcium ion permeability than &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor (AMPAR) or kainate receptor (KAR). NMDAR has thus been the focus of a number of studies that have screened for new therapeutic targets for stroke. Although NMDARs mediate ischemic brain damage, blocking these receptors to protect neuronal injury leads to severe side effects <xref rid="pone.0052788-Fix1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052788-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Targeting nNOS activity may therefore be a more effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of ischemic damage.</p><p>The Trx system, which comprises Trx proteins, TrxR proteins and NAPDH, is involved in a large number of cellular functions such as DNA synthesis, apoptosis and redox signaling, and also in the role of these pathways in a variety of diseases, and is regarded as having a critical role in the defense against oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0052788-Holmgren1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In recent years, Trx proteins have been reported to have a number of other functions, particularly in the reduction of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds in proteins, and in the generation of oxidized peroxiredoxins, which disrupt organic hydroperoxides, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and peroxynitrite <xref rid="pone.0052788-Kalinina1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. TrxR proteins, which reduce a broad range of substrates including an oxidized form of thioredoxin, can also directly reduce lipid hydroperoxides, dehydroascorbic and lipoic acids. Recently, the interplay between Trx and S-nitrosylation has becomes a research area of great interest.</p><p>Our previous studies have shown that the S-nitrosylation of nNOS is decreased during rat cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion, but the functions and underlying mechanisms remained unclear. In our current study, we report that nNOS can be S-nitrosylated by the exogenous NO donor GSNO in HEK293 cells, and that the Cys<sup>331</sup> residue is the key nitrosylation site. Our analyses also show that nNOS is S-nitrosylated in resting hippocampal CA1 and primary cortical neurons but undergoes denitrosylation induced by ischemia/reperfusion in hippocampal CA1 neurons or by OGD/reoxygenation in primary cortical neurons. We demonstrate that nNOS denitrosylation is induced by calcium ion influx via NMDAR during the early stages of reperfusion, which is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent process principally mediated by the Trx1 system, and that nNOS denitrosylation is coupled with an increase in the activity of this enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Antibody and Reagents</title><p>The following primary antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) were used in the experiments: rabbit polyclonal anti-nNOS antibody (sc-648), rabbit polyclonal anti-CaM antibody (sc-5537), rabbit polyclonal anti-TRXR1 antibody (sc-20147) and rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody (sc-10731).

Cys<sup>331</sup> was identified as the key site of nitrosylation on nNOS. Further, nNOS is highly S-nitrosylated in resting hippocampal CA1 and primary cortical neurons which was found to undergo denitrosylation induced by ischemia/reperfusion in hippocampal CA1 neurons or by OGD/reoxygenation in primary cortical neurons. Our current data demonstrate for the first time that nNOS denitrosylation is related to NMDAR, calcium, and CaM and is principally mediated by the Trx1 system. We further show that nNOS denitrosylation is coupled with increased activity of this enzyme, this process may be exerted by inducing the enzyme dephosphorylation. Moreover, the prevention of nNOS denitrosylation exerts protective effects on neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by both OGD/reoxygenation in primary cortical neurons and ischemia/reperfusion in hippocampal CA1 neurons.</p><p>S-nitrosylation and denitrosylation of protein cysteinyl residues have been suggested to be important NO-dependent post-translational modifications that in addition to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can globally modulate protein function and activity both under physiological and pathological conditions <xref rid="pone.0052788-Hess1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It have been reported that many proteins can be S-nitrosylated by NO synthesized by nNOS. For example, GluR6 (glutamate receptor 6) is S-nitrosylated by nNOS-derived NO during the early stages of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and induces neuronal apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0052788-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. JNK3 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3), a pro-apoptosis kinase, is activated via S-nitrosylation induced by nNOS during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in the same way <xref rid="pone.0052788-Pei1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), a pro-apoptosis proteinase, is activated by S-nitrosylation induced by nNOS and induces neuronal apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0052788-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is also S-nitrosylated by nNOS and is involved in ischemic brain injury in the rat hippocampal CA1 region <xref rid="pone.0052788-Pei2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The evidence thus indicates that nNOS is a critical source of NO and thereby mediates protein S-nitrosylation. We wanted to determine however, whether the activity of nNOS itself is regulated in this way. Our previous study showed that nNOS is denitrosylated during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in the rat hippocampus, but the underlying mechanism and functional significance of this remained to be elucidated <xref rid="pone.0052788-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It has been suggested that the activity of all three NOS enzyme isoforms can be inhibited through the formation of a complex between NO and the heme moiety of these proteins <xref rid="pone.0052788-Hurshman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052788-Black1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, new findings indicate that the activity of eNOS can be inhibited by NO in another way i.e. S-nitrosylation at cysteine thiol groups that induces dimer disruption and dephosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0052788-Ravi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052788-Erwin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Hence, the aim of our present study was to test whether the activity of nNOS is also regulated by S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation.</p><p>Our present results reveal that the S-nitrosylation of nNOS leads to decrease in enzyme activity through an analysis of the effects of the physiological NO donor GSNO on the activity and S-nitrosylation of nNOS overexpressed in HEK293 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>, nNOS S-nitrosylation is inversely related to its enzyme activity levels in vitro. Furthermore, the S-nitrosylation of nNOS and the inhibitory effects on its enzyme activity induced by NO can be reversed or blocked by ascorbate, DTT and NEM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g001">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>). Our results further indicate that S-nitrosylation occurs on cysteinyl residues and can be removed by reducing agents in parallel with denitrosylation. Our data thus suggest that the inhibitory mechanism of S-nitrosylation on enzyme activity may have important physiological roles in vivo.</p><p>An important question arising from our present analyses is how nNOS enzyme function is actually regulated by S-nitrosylation of a cysteine residue. Cysteine residues can be involved in regulating protein activity and in signaling events through reactions involving their thiol groups, including redox events (chemical reduction or oxidation), the chelation of transition metals (chiefly Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>) or S-nitrosylation <xref rid="pone.0052788-Lipton1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It has been reported that the Cys<sup>99</sup> residue of human eNOS is responsible for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) binding <xref rid="pone.0052788-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Recently also, Cys<sup>99</sup> of the eNOS tetrathiolate cluster was found to be S-nitrosylated by an NO donor and thought to alter pterin binding, mediate the loss of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and convert the eNOS dimer into a monomer, with a resultant loss of enzyme activity <xref rid="pone.0052788-Ravi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In contrast, another study concludes that the S-nitrosylation of eNOS alters its enzyme activity in association with changes in its phosphorylation and subcellular targeting status rather than disruption of its dimer form <xref rid="pone.0052788-Erwin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It has been reported that the C331A mutant of nNOS is defective in arginine binding and catalytic activity, and also that the imidazole binding affinity, CaM binding affinity, rates of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction in the C331A mutant are altered compared with the wild type nNOS protein <xref rid="pone.0052788-Pavel1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We found in our current study that when the Cys<sup>331</sup> residue (a critical site for Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding) of nNOS was substituted by glycine, the S-nitrosylation of the protein and enzyme activity levels were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Based on these findings and the evidence of previous reports, we deduce that the regulation of nNOS activity via the S-nitrosylation of Cys<sup>331</sup> is possibly exerted through the altered binding of cofactors such as Zn<sup>2+</sup>. More studies will be needed to properly elucidate this mechanism.</p><p>Given that the activity of nNOS is probably regulated by S-nitrosylation and it is well established that the phosphorylation of nNOS reduces its activity <xref rid="pone.0052788-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052788-Rameau2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, we speculated as to which of these modifications is responsible for the activation of this enzyme. From the results of our OGD/reoxygenation time course experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), we observed that nNOS is S-nitrosylated in resting primary cortical neurons. After treatment of these cells with OGD/reoxygenation, nNOS is denitrosylated to at the maximum extent at 6 hours and is then progressively renitrosylated to its original resting level at about 12 hours. Interestingly, the time course of nNOS phosphorylation at Ser<sup>847</sup> accords with its observed S-nitrosylation pattern. Furthermore, through our analysis of GSNO, DTT, auranofin (inhibitor of TrxR) as well as DNCB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g003">Fig. 3B, F</xref>), which alter the S-nitrosylation of nNOS, we found that nNOS phosphorylation was modulated at the same time. From the results described above, we conclude that nNOS phosphorylation has a consanguineous relationship with nNOS S-nitrosylation and that the enzyme is much more likely to be modulated by nNOS S-nitrosylation. Which raises one interesting question: what is the relationship between nNOS S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation? To investigate the relationship between the phosphorylation and S-nitrosylation of nNOS, the GSNO and A23187 were treated on the cells transfected with WT-nNOS, C331G nNOS, and S847A nNOS, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g002">Figures 2C, D, E</xref>, we speculate that the phosphorylation of nNOS was regulated by the enzyme S-nitrosylation and it is a one-way process. We remain uncertain of the precise mechanisms underlying this and further studies are planned in our laboratory to elucidate this.</p><p>Our previous experiments have demonstrated that nNOS S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation are significantly decreased during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in the rat hippocampus CA1 region <xref rid="pone.0052788-Pei2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Interestingly, our present results show that there is no significant change between phosphorylation of nNOS at 6 hours and 12 hours of reperfusion compared with the sham controls. However, our current data indicate that nNOS S-nitrosylation is dramatically decreased at the same time points of reperfusion. Although both nNOS and iNOS are known to be expressed in brain, it is reported that only nNOS is continuously activated and produces NO during the early stages of cerebral ischemia, whilst iNOS protein expression and catalytic activity is detectable at 12 hours after cerebral ischemia and produces an excessive amount of NO in the late stages of ischemia <xref rid="pone.0052788-Samdani1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052788-Keynes1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Based on the above findings, 6 hours of reperfusion was chosen as the optimal condition to prevent the interruption of NO induction by iNOS.</p><p>Although a number of mechanisms of protein S-nitrosylation have been clarified previously, the mechanism of protein denitrosylation remains largely unknown. It is reported that calcium mediates denitrosylation <xref rid="pone.0052788-Chvanov1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and as nNOS is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent enzyme we speculated as to whether its denitrosylation had any relationship with calcium and CaM. From the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, we observe that nNOS denitrosylation can be induced by a calcium ion influx. Additionally, it has been reported that protein denitrosylation can be induced by membrane receptors <xref rid="pone.0052788-Benhar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The NMDAR-PSD95-nNOS complex couples the activation of NMDAR with the production of NO, which then mediates NMDAR-dependent excitotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0052788-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, NMDAR has a higher calcium ion permeability than either the AMPAR or KAR. We therefore used MK801 in our current experiments and the results indicate that the calcium induced denitrosylation of nNOS is possibly mediated through NMDAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) during the process of ischemia-reperfusion or OGD/reoxygenation. Moreover, from the results showing that nNOS denitrosylation can be blocked by calcium chelators and a calmodulin inhibitor, we conclude that nNOS denitrosylation induced by OGD/reoxygenation or cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is dependent on the binding of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM complex.</p><p>Recently, several denitrosylases have been identified, such as S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, thioredoxin systems, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), and xanthine oxidase (XO) <xref rid="pone.0052788-Zai1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052788-Trujillo1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, two cellular enzyme systems in particular have emerged as physiologically relevant denitrosylases <xref rid="pone.0052788-Benhar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) system, which comprises GSH and GSNOR, and the thioredoxin (Trx) system, which comprises Trx protein, Trx reductase (TrxR) and NADPA. The Trx system is present in all living organisms <xref rid="pone.0052788-Lillig1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and can be divided into cytoplasm-specific (Trx1 system) and mitochondria-specific (Trx2 system) by means of its subcellular localization. Because nNOS is predominantly present in the cytoplasm, we hypothesized that its denitrosylation would be principally mediated by the Trx1 system. First, auranofin and DNCB (inhibitors of TrxR), both rapid and efficient inhibitors but with dissimilar structures, were administered to cells and the denitrosylation of nNOS was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g003">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052788-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Next, siRNAs against TrxR1 and also TrxR1 AS-ODNs were designed to verify the function of the Trx1 system in inducing nNOS denitrosylation. The results indicate that nNOS denitrosylation is mainly mediated by the Trx1 system. Based on these results above, we conclude that the denitrosylation of nNOS is associated with calcium and the Trx1/TrxR1 system. However, more studies are required to elucidate the precise interactions between calcium, nNOS and Trx1 system. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that other denitrosylases are involved in this process.</p><p>Taken together, we reveal from our current data that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the Trx1 system are involved in the process of nNOS denitrosylation in a rat ischemia model. However, whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> is related to the activity of the Trx1 system during this process is unclear. It has been reported that the expression and activity of TrxR1 is increased in human endothelial cells after treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 <xref rid="pone.0052788-Anema1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052788-Crane1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. It would be of interest therefore to measure the activity of TrxR1 and elucidate its possible relationship with Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the process of ischemia.</p><p>In summary, our present data show that the activity and phosphorylation of nNOS are regulated by the S-nitrosylation of its zinc-tetrathiolate cysteine. The activity level of this enzyme is regulated by its S-nitrosylation level. Moreover, nNOS denitrosylation is principally mediated by calcium and the Trx1 system. nNOS activity is known to be regulated by complex post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. S-nitrosylation must now be included as a key nNOS post-translational modification which may have vital significance for the regulation of nNOS activity in the nervous system.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0052788-StuartSmith1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
