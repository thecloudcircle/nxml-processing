In fetal development, urinary tract obstruction impairs renal growth and development and leads to renal dysplasia. Congenital obstructive nephropathy is therefore fundamentally distinct from obstruction acquired later in life. A complex interplay of genetic and non-genetic factors regulates the development of congenital obstructive nephropathy [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in neonatal mice at the second day of life is a model of congenital obstructive nephropathy and studies the effects of urinary tract obstruction on renal development. Neonatal UUO reduces nephron numbers, induces interstitial fibrosis, and promotes renal insufficiency. So far, there is no treatment available to restore kidney function. Congenital obstructive nephropathies in humans develop prenatally, mostly in the midtrimester during nephrogenesis. Whereas nephrogenesis in humans finishes prenatally at 36 weeks of gestation, nephrogenesis in mice finishes postnatally 2&#x02013;3 weeks after birth. Therefore, UUO in neonatal mice at the second day of life is a model for congenital obstruction and disrupts nephron development at a similar stage as observed in humans. Neonatal UUO in mice leads to renal inflammation, tubular apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in the kidney [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Central to these events is the cytokine-mediated influx of macrophages and T-cells into the obstructed kidney. The Janus kinase-2 (JAK-2) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling pathway regulates gene expression, inflammatory reactions, and differentiation in different cells and organs [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. STAT3 is an important transcription factor that is involved in cytokine-mediated signaling and development of fibrosis in a variety of organs like heart, lung, and kidney [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous growth factors and cytokines, including the interferon and gp130 family (IL-6, IL-11) activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Upon receptor binding activation of STAT3 proceeds through phosphorylation of the janus kinase (JAK) family which in turn phosphorylates STAT3. The activated JAK2/STAT3 pathway stimulates gene expression, inflammatory reactions, and cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the kidney, STAT3 activation increases in interstitial fibroblasts and tubular cells of the obstructed kidney in adult mice with UUO [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tyrphostin AG490 efficiently blocks the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in different models [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the kidney, Tyrphostin AG490 protects from oxidative stress, inflammation, ischemia reperfusion injury, and sepsis [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The effect of Tyrphostin AG490 in the developing kidney with obstruction has not been addressed so far. To fill this gap, we have studied the effects of JAK2/STAT3 blockade in UUO kidneys during nephron development and could show that Tyrphostin AG490 effectively reduces inflammation and fibrosis in the neonatal kidney with obstruction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>Two-day-old male and female WT mice (C57/BL6) were distributed into twelve groups (n = 15 in each group) receiving either subcutaneous injections of the JAK2/STAT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor Tyrphostin AG490 (AG490) (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) at 10 mg/kg BW/d dissolved in 45% DMSO with 55% NaCl (vehicle) for 1 (day 2&#x02013;3 of life), 5 (day 2&#x02013;7 of life) or 12 days (day 2&#x02013;14 of life), or vehicle once daily [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Mice were subjected to complete left ureteral obstruction (UUO) or sham operation under general anesthesia with isoflurane (3&#x02013;5% v/v) and oxygen at the second day of life as described before [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. After recovery neonatal mice were returned to their mothers until sacrifice at day 3, 7 and 14 of life (1, 5 and 12 days after surgery; n = 15 per group). Tyrphostin AG490 injection volumes (7&#x02013;28 &#x003bc;l/d) increased over time in proportion to the body weight gain in neonatal mice. Tyrphostin AG490 treated mice appeared healthy and development was unremarkable. The animal experiments were approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation of the University of Munich (Az 55.2-1-54-2531-90-10). The kidneys were removed and either fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% for immunostaining for 24 hours or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The PKSV-PR cell is an immortalized renal cell line derived from late proximal tubules microdissected from the kidney of a transgenic mouse carrying the SV40 large T antigen gene (Tag) placed under the control of the 5&#x02019; regulatory sequence of the L-type pyruvate kinase promoter [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The proximal tubular cell line PKSV-PR was provided by Dr. Alain Vandewalle, INSERM, Paris. For studies involving cyclic stretch, PKSV-PR cells were grown as a monolayer on flexible collagen-coated membranes for 3 days (BioFlex Culture Plates, Flexcell, Dunn Labortechnik GmbH, Asbach, Germany) under conditions as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The culture plates were placed on vacuum-based loading docks of the Flexercell-Strain Unit (FX-5000T) in the incubator. PKSV-PR cells were subjected to pulsatile cyclic stretch at a frequency of 1 Hz with an elongation of 20% for 2, 4, and 6 hours [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Tyrosin kinase inhibitor Tyrphostin AG490 (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was used as JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor. Tyrphostin AG490 was added (100 <bold>&#x003bc;</bold>M) to the medium 24 hours before cyclic stretch [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Controls (non-stretched cells) were exposed to identical experimental conditions but without cyclic stretch. Cells were harvested and proteins were extracted. Protein expression was analysed by Western blotting. Pro-inflammatory chemokines in supernatants were measured by ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Identification of p-STAT3 and infiltrating leukocytes</title><p>The abundance of activated p-STAT3 and infiltrating leukocytes in the neonatal kidney were examined by immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded kidney sections were subjected to antigen retrieval and incubated with either rabbit anti-mouse phospho-STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling #9145, New England Biolab GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) at 1:50), anti-mouse F4/80 antibody against macrophages (Santa Cruz Heidelberg, Germany, # sc-377009 at 1:50), or rat anti-human CD3 antibody (AbD Serotec # MCA1477, Duesseldorf, Germany) against T-lymphocytes at 1:50.

We show that JAK2/STAT3 activation mediates inflammation and fibrosis in the neonatal kidney following UUO. STAT3 expression rapidly increased after ureteral obstruction and localized to tubular and interstitial cells. The upregulation of STAT3 induced the production and secretion of chemokines and mediated leukocyte infiltration into the obstructed kidney. By using the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor Tyrphostin AG490 chemokine secretion and leukocyte infiltration were blocked in neonatal UUO kidneys. Several studies in adult mice have shown that STAT3 blockade prevents leukocyte infiltration by downregulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) and chemokines (CCL2) [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our results in neonatal UUO are in line with those observations. Tyrphostin AG490 reduced macrophage and T-cell infiltration in the developing kidney with obstruction. Blocking STAT3 by Mefunidone reduced leukocyte infiltration and interstitial fibrosis in adult rats with UUO [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Paclitaxel reduced macrophage infiltration and fibroblast activation by inhibiting STAT3 in adult mice with UUO [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, pharmacological blockade and genetical knockdown of STAT3 reduced macrophage infiltration in diabetic mice and prevented glomerulopathy [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, JAK2/STAT3 blockade reduced interstitial inflammation as well as tubular apoptosis in the neonatal kidney with UUO. The response of the neonatal kidney to obstruction is clearly different from the adult kidney and shows more damage [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Oxidative stress, hypoxia, and cytokines are responsible for tubular apoptosis following UUO. Since STAT3 regulates pro-apoptotic cytokines like TNF-&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2;1, JAK2/STAT3 blockade may inhibit apoptosis by suppression of TNF-&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2;1-expression in neonatal UUO-kidneys. TNF-&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2;1 are able to increase STAT3-activation and amplify the apoptotic signal in UUO. We show that Tyrphostin AG490 treated mice were effectively protected from tubular and interstitial apoptosis. Accordingly, caspase 8 cleavage decreased in neonatal UUO kidneys treated with JAK2/STAT3 blockade. Similar to earlier reports, we could demonstrate better survival in tubular cells under Tyrphostin AG490 [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Presumably, this reduction of tubular cell death in turn prevented further inflammation and reduced interstitial fibrosis. Tyrphostin AG490 increased tubular proliferation in neonatal kidneys following UUO. By contrast, proliferation of interstitial cells was blocked by Tyrphostin AG490, suggesting less proliferation of infiltrating leukocytes, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.</p><p>Interstitial fibrosis develops in parallel with tubular injury and the inflammatory response following UUO [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Fibroblasts expand in the obstructed kidney due to local proliferation, TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, recruitment of bone marrow-derived fibrocytes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), macrophage to myofibroblast transition (MMT), pericyte to myofibroblast transition, and endothelial myofibroblast transition [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Myofibroblasts are the principal source of extracellular matrix in renal fibrosis. Evaluation of myofibroblasts by &#x003b1;-SMA expression shows persistent activation in neonatal UUO [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our study, Tyrphostin AG490 reduced &#x003b1;-SMA expression and extracellular matrix deposition in the neonatal kidney with obstruction. Our results are in line with recent data showing that mice with conditional deletion of STAT3 in fibroblasts have less myofibroblasts and less fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a 72 kDa collagenase that is important in extracellular matrix metabolism and renal fibrosis. MMP-2 cleaves type IV collagen, and degrades denatured collagens. In the kidney, MMP-2 is upregulated following UUO in adult mice [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Reduced MMP-2 expression during UUO protects mice against renal fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Since MMP-2 is a target gene of STAT3, JAK2/STAT3 blockade reduced MMP-2 expression and renal fibrosis in the developing kidney with obstruction. STAT3 seems to act as a central regulator linking tubular and interstitial cells in tissue fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In tubular cells STAT3 activation induces the upregulation of profibrotic factors like TGF-&#x003b2;1, PDGF, and TIMP-1 and controls EMT after renal injury [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In fibroblasts, STAT3-activation leads to proliferation und myofibroblast activation. In our study, Tyrphostin AG490 reduced inflammation and decreased renal fibrosis in the developing kidney with obstruction. Recently, Matsui et al. have shown that mesenchymal stem cells protect against obstruction-induced fibrosis by decreasing STAT3 activation [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Profibrotic STAT3 signaling critically involves the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Members of the Src family kinases interact with cytosolic, nuclear and membrane proteins. They modify these proteins by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and contribute to STAT3-dependent cellular transformation. This has been demonstrated for Fyn, a member of the Src family kinases that promotes renal fibrosis in adult mice with UUO involving STAT3 signaling [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In contrast, genetic absence of Fyn led to antifibrotic effects and downregulation of STAT3 emphasizing the pivotal role of STAT3 in the development of fibrosis. To identify further mechanisms of STAT3 signaling, we analyzed markers of inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation, and cell cycle in stretched tubular cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mechanical stretch of tubular cells <italic>in vitro</italic> mimics changes in intrarenal pressure following ureteral obstruction. Mechanical stretch upregulates TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression and p-STAT3 in human tubular cells [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 and knockdown by siRNA targeting human STAT3 suppress stretch-induced TGF-&#x003b2;1. In line with this, we could show that Tyrphostin AG490 efficiently blocked stretch-induced upregulation of p-STAT3 in tubular cells. Tyrphostin AG490 inhibited the stretch-induced expression of CCL-2 and CCL-5, thereby reducing the inflammatory response. This effect was probably due to a direct down-regulation of the expression of CCL-2 and CCL-5.</p><p>Cell cycle arrest at G2/M in renal tubular cells promotes interstitial fibrosis after UUO [<xref rid="pone.0226675.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226675.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Arrested tubular cells produce profibrogenic factors like TGF-&#x003b2;1 and Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF). In our study, G2/M-arrest was present in neonatal UUO-kidneys and in stretched tubular cells. Tyrphostin AG490 successfully reduced G2/M-arrest in the developing kidney with obstruction, thereby leading to a sharp decline in interstitial fibrosis.</p><p>In summary, our results show that JAK2/STAT3-signaling is a key effector of disease progression in our neonatal mouse model of UUO identifying STAT3 as critical factor in mediating the inflammatory response and the development of interstitial fibrosis in the neonatal kidney with obstruction. Targeting JAK2/STAT3 may therefore offer an interesting approach for therapeutic interventions in congenital obstructive nephropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226675.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Animal experiments were approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation of the University of Munich and documented accordingly to the ARRIVE guidelines.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226675.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226675.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Tyrphostin AG490 reduced interstitial apoptosis (A) and increased tubular proliferation (B) in obstructed kidneys after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in neonatal mice.</bold> Mice received Tyrphostin AG490 or vehicle by daily injections.
