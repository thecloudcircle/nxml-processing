Our previous studies on WISP1 implied it could be a harmful mediator in septic mice. However, its role in liver ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is unknown. This study investigated the effects of WISP1 on liver I/R damage. Male C57BL/6 wild-type mice were used to undergo 60&#x02009;min segmental (70%) ischemia. WISP1 expression was measured after indicated time points of reperfusion. Anti-WISP1 antibody was injected intraperitoneally to mice. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice and TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-&#x003b2; (TRIF) knockout mice were adopted in this study. WISP1 was significantly enhanced after 6&#x02009;h of reperfusion when compared with sham treated mice and significantly decreased either by TLR4 knockout mice or TRIF knockout mice. Anti-WISP1 antibody significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), pathological changes and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the mice following I/R. Furthermore, significantly increased serum transaminase levels were found in C57 wild-type mice treated with recombinant WISP1 protein, but not found in TLR4 knockout or TRIF knockout mice subjected to liver I/R. Taken together, WISP1 might contribute to hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury in mice and possibly depends on TLR4/TRIF signaling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Hepatic ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is unavoidable during shock, trauma, elective liver resections or liver transplantation, and adversely affects patient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Thus, ameliorating I/R induced injury is essential for patients&#x02019; postoperative recovery. Several harmful factors have been identified in I/R injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Recently, Li HH <italic>et al.</italic> have found a susceptibility gene to organ injury, WISP1, which was concluded as a damage associated molecule in ventilator induced acute lung injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our further study have showed WISP1 might act as a harmful mediator in septic mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, its role in hepatic I/R induced injury is still in the air. TLR4 signaling pathway play a pivotal role in various physiology and pathology processes, including warm liver I/R<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. It can recognize some kinds of Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, fibronection and heat shock proteins. Although we have not yet determined whether WISP1 could be a DAMP molecule, in view of our recently findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, we hypothesis that WISP1 might be also recognized by TLR4 signaling.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to uncover the notion that WISP1 contributes to liver I/R induced injury and depends on TLR4/TRIF signaling pathway. The major and novel findings of this study are: a) WISP1 levels are increased in the liver tissue from mice subjected to I/R and increased in the primary kupffer cells following hypoxia; b) blockade of WISP1 alleviates warm hepatic I/R induced injury; c) blockade of WISP1 decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines expression; d) recombinant WISP1 (rWISP1) worsens liver I/R injury and increases pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion; and e) WISP1-mediated hepatic I/R injury requires TLR4/TRIF signaling pathway.</p><p>WISP1 was originally uncovered as a Wnt1-responsive target, which contains the connective tissue growth factor, cysteine-rich-61 (CYR61) and nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Previous studies about WISP1 mainly focused on chronic diseases, such as cancer and fibrosis. In this study, we sought to reveal the biological function of WISP1 in I/R induced acute liver injury. We showed that hepatic WISP1 expression was significantly increased at 6&#x02009;h and 12&#x02009;h after reperfusion of ischemia liver in this study. We also showed that blockade of WISP1 by using anti-WISP1 antibody can ameliorate hepatic I/R injury and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in ischemia liver tissue. However, it is unclear whether the increases in WISP1 levels are essential to the pro-inflammatory effects. WISP1 is a secreted extracellular protein, whereas it is not known whether WISP1 is secreted or passively released from damaged cells following I/R induced liver injury in our study. In addition, we have not found any significant increases about serum WISP1 levels in mice, which might reveal a local or paracrine-like action for WISP1.</p><p>To identify the molecular mechanisms and signaling transduction pathways, in which WISP1 is involved, we explored TLR4/TRIF signaling pathway. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the innate immune system against pathogenic microorganisms by recognizing the pathogen-associated molecular patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> or host-derived molecules by recognizing the danger-associated molecular patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, which have been discovered to involve in hepatocellular damage in liver I/R injury. TLR4 is one of the TLRs, which plays a vital role in endotoxin signal transduction and recognizes different kinds of endogenous ligands, such as fibronection, &#x003b2;-defensin, heat shock protein 72 and HMGB1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The release of these ligands function as TLR4 agonists can stimulate inflammatory activity and modulate TLR4 signaling cascades. Our research support that the TLR4 receptor may also play an important role in WISP1-mediated liver I/R injury. WISP1 expression was significantly enhanced in TLR4<sup>+/+</sup> mice that were subjected to hepatic I/R, while this enhancement was negated when detected in TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Moreover, TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that were suffered from hepatic I/R are not affected by the administration of rWISP1 protein or anti-WISP1 antibody, when compared with the mice treated with isotype control IgG.</p><p>TRIF is a key adaptor, which located in the downstream of TLR4. TLR4 signaling through TRIF can result in the progress of various physiological and pathological changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. TRIF also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of liver I/R injury. Zhai <italic>et al</italic>. have reported TLR4 mediated liver warm I/R damage mainly through TRIF signaling, but not MyD88 dependent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. We investigated the role of MyD88 in WISP1-mediated I/R injury and found depletion of MyD88 downregulated WISP1 expression in the liver, however, liver damage was not ameliorated in MyD88 knockout mice subjected to I/R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Accordingly, our study mainly focused on TRIF signaling and also uncovered TRIF can significantly affect liver I/R injury. We also clarified WISP1 mediated liver I/R injury depends on TRIF signaling. However, neither attenuate nor heighten WISP1 could we found the decreased expression levels of TLR4 and TRIF in the liver following I/R. And this interesting phenomenon was also disclosed in vitro study by using primary kupffer cells suffered from hypoxia. Thus, we speculate that the secreted WISP1 from damaged liver tissue may produce the inflammatory injury response via activating the function of TLR4/TRIF, but not its expression.</p><p>In summary, our study suggests that WISP1 appears to be a damage associated molecule in hepatic I/R injury, and that the protective effects of blocking WISP1 and the detrimental effects of rWISP1 in hepatic I/R are dependent on the activation of the TLR4/TRIF function. Accordingly, blocking the abnormal expression of WISP1 may be a potential preventive therapy option against liver warm I/R injury.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Tong, Y. <italic>et al.</italic> WISP1 mediates hepatic warm ischemia reperfusion injury via TLR4 signaling in mice. <italic>Sci.
