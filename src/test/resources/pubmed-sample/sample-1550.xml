However, there are volunteers that behave differently, spending their free time with people with mental illness and providing direct input in the form of befriending. Whilst there are a range of befriending programmes, little is known about who these volunteer befrienders are, and a previous review of different forms of volunteering in mental health care found data on only 63 befrienders.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted a systematic electronic search of databases (BNI, CNIL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Registers, Web of Science) to detect all papers reporting characteristics of befriending volunteers in mental health care published between 2011 and April 2018. The articles retrieved were combined with previous papers identified in an earlier review and with relevant papers identified by experts in the field. The articles that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and narratively synthesised.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, reporting characteristics of a total of 577 volunteer befrienders. The most often reported characteristics were age and gender, motivations to volunteer and experience of the role. Whilst characteristics vary greatly, most volunteers are female, and the average age is 50&#x02009;years. Motivations generally fit into the categories of &#x0201c;giving&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;getting&#x0201d; and experiences are mixed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Published research on volunteer befrienders has increased in the last eight years, but is still limited. The range of characteristics suggests that there is a potential for encouraging a variety of people to volunteer as befrienders for people with mental illness. Understanding the characteristics and motivations of volunteers may help refine programmes and improve the experience of the volunteer befrienders.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12888-018-1960-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Review</kwd><kwd>Befriending</kwd><kwd>Characteristics</kwd><kwd>Mental illness</kwd><kwd>Volunteering</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Experience</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007602</institution-id><institution>Programme Grants for Applied Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP-PG-0611-20002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Priebe</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">People with mental illness can often face negative stereotypes, discriminatory behaviour and sometimes even self-stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the literature suggests that some people in the general population have a tendency to distance themselves from those with mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite this, some people seek direct contact and offer their free time as volunteers to support individuals with mental illness.</p><p id="Par11">A particular form of volunteering in mental health care is befriending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], where volunteers usually provide repeated, one-to-one and face-to-face contact to develop social relationships with people with mental illness. Some studies reported a reduction of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in people supported by befrienders. The literature suggests that volunteer befrienders can reap benefits as well, even outside mental health, such as being able to help others, gain experience, or develop a sense of satisfaction from befriending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Yet, research on befriending is limited, and little is known about the characteristics of those who volunteer to become befrienders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such information is crucial for befriending programmes as it is imperative to find, recruit and retain the necessary volunteers.</p><p id="Par13">Motivations of volunteers have been explored previously, for example, as illustrated in the &#x02018;Octagon Model&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which covers the dimensions of &#x02018;giving&#x02019; versus &#x02018;getting&#x02019;, &#x02018;distance&#x02019; versus &#x02018;proximity&#x02019;, &#x02018;thought&#x02019; versus &#x02018;action&#x02019;, and &#x02018;continuity&#x02019; versus &#x02018;newness&#x02019; of experience.</p><p id="Par14">In 2012, Hallett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] published a systematic review of volunteers in mental health care, addressing their characteristics, reasons for volunteering, and experience in the volunteering role (based on a search in November 2010). However, Hallett et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] review included all types of volunteering, such as, helping in groups, providing training in educational programmes, and one-off support for events. It found information on a total of 540 volunteers but only 63 of these were befrienders. Hallett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] identified a generally mixed demographic; however, a large proportion of befrienders&#x000a0;were female. Additionally, experiences of befriending were mostly positive, and the motivations of &#x0201c;giving&#x0201d; something to others or &#x0201c;getting&#x0201d; something from the experience were cited commonly for volunteer befrienders.</p><p id="Par15">Against this background, our aim has been to conduct a systematic review to identify the characteristics of volunteer befrienders and to describe their motivations and experiences. We assumed that the literature since the Hallett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] review would provide more data on which to draw conclusions about who volunteers to befriend people with mental illness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par16">A systematic literature review, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], was used to identify the characteristics of befriender volunteers in mental health. This was combined with a narrative synthesis grounded on the guidelines developed by Popay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to describe their motivations and experiences in volunteering.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Search strategy</title><p id="Par17">We searched the following databases: BNI, CNIL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Registers, Web of Science (Psychiatry) and grey literature databases.

The results from this search conducted on 11 April 2018 were included.</p><p id="Par18">A secondary hand search was performed in relevant psychiatric journals, grey literature and references, and experts were contacted to identify additional relevant papers in the field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par19">The review included primary studies reporting data on volunteer befrienders. Eligibility criteria were: i) participants were unpaid lay/nonprofessional volunteers, ii) the volunteer activity was a regular commitment (e.g. not a &#x02018;one-off&#x02019;) with an adult mental health population, iii) the volunteering activity involved only one-to-one, face-to-face contacts.</p><p id="Par20">Texts were excluded if they reported information about: i) volunteers that were currently peers, peer workers, family members, paid carers, paid lay workers, mental health professionals or already known friends, ii) the volunteer activity was not specific to a population with severe mental illness (e.g. dementia/substance abuse/HIV/refugees/cancer volunteering), iii) the volunteering had other formats beyond one-to-one (e.g. groups), face-to-face contact (e.g. telephone helpline/online volunteering), iv) volunteering was part of a course requirement, v) volunteering was a one-off activity (e.g. helping after a natural disaster), vi) the literature was in an inappropriate extraction material (e.g. charity advertising booklet or report).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data extraction and analysis</title><p id="Par21">Following the search, all potential studies were exported into EndNote version X5 bibliographic software and duplicates removed. Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion with a random selection of 20% of the abstracts being screened by a second assessor. If there was any ambiguity about the study, the full paper was obtained and reviewed by two assessors. Inter-reviewer agreement at the screening stage was 94%. There were no discrepancies relating to those papers selected for inclusion in the full-text search. Data extraction was completed by two assessors. Disagreements regarding full-texts were addressed by discussion and input from a third reviewer.</p><p id="Par22">The following quantitative and qualitative data of the studies were extracted: i) about the studies: year, country, setting, aims, and methods; ii) about volunteers: number, age, gender, education level, employment status, religion, ethnicity, relationship status, living arrangements, motivations, previous experience in mental health volunteering, previous connection to organisation, previous experience as a patient in mental health care, volunteer role, volunteer activities, length of commitment, positive and negative experiences; iii) about the volunteering organisation: type, patient group supported, benefits to people with a mental illness, method of recruiting volunteers, volunteer selection criteria, matching process, volunteer training and supervision.</p><p id="Par23">Narrative synthesis was used to analyse the motivations and experiences of the volunteers. MPC independently conducted the preliminary synthesis based on the extracted findings. By deductively conducting the narrative synthesis, preliminary themes were developed based on the hypothetic-deductive approach featured in the literature, with motivations categorised either as &#x02018;giving&#x02019; (doing something for others) or &#x02018;getting&#x02019;, (doing something for themselves); and experiences as &#x02018;positive&#x02019; or &#x02018;negative&#x02019;.</p><p id="Par24">These overarching categories were discussed with all members of the team through an iterative process of continuous discussion, critical reflection, reference to the extracted data and feedback, to ensure a range and depth of the materials. Similar concepts were grouped into the most suitable overarching category, and sub-categories were created where relevant. Tabulation and grouping data was used, selecting suitable illustrative quotations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><p id="Par25">The searches yielded a total of 24,655 papers which were then screened.

Some described ways in which volunteering contributed to them personally, such as increasing their self-esteem, confidence and acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many volunteers felt that with time they gained a genuine friend themselves, wanting to continue the relationship as friends, with many expressing that the benefits of one-to-one volunteering far outweighed the cost in time, money and energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">A positive impact from volunteering on attitudes toward mental illness was discussed in three papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The experience of volunteering made befrienders reevaluate their preconceptions surrounding mental illness, which they considered a valuable growth opportunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In some cases this changed previously negative attitudes toward people with mental illness; some lost their initial concerns about the unreliability of people with a mental illness, and found them &#x0201c;surprisingly normal&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For others with personal experience of mental illness, volunteering offered a new perspective on their own problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], learning and reflecting about themselves, and instilled a sense that they had benefitted from befriending as much as the befriendee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Negative experiences</title><p id="Par46">Negative experiences were described in relation to the behavior of the befriendee in three papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some befrienders were left feeling unappreciated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] when the befriendee did not maintain communication, was often late, or appeared to use the befriender &#x0201c;as a taxicab&#x0201d;. Other volunteers expressed difficulties in dealing with confidentiality and privacy, balancing their personal feelings with a sense of professionalism when sensitive information was disclosed by the befriendee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Another matter which was disliked was the recruitment process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the bureaucracy (police checks) and waiting (lengthy delays) experiences once recruited, making befrienders drop out of the programme before they had even begun.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Main findings</title><p id="Par47">This review provided data on 577 volunteer befrienders from nine studies, around nine times as many befrienders as summarised in a previous review. Yet, more than half of the total number of included befrienders derived from one large study in Austria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">The findings suggest that the mean age of befrienders is 50&#x02009;years-old, but with a very broad range, that they are predominantly female, and that many have experience of psychiatric treatment either themselves or through a close friend or family member. Overall, there was a substantial variation in the socio-demographic characteristics of befrienders between, and also within, studies.</p><p id="Par49">In terms of motivations for befriending, both &#x0201c;giving&#x0201d; something to the befriendee community or in general, and &#x0201c;getting&#x0201d; something out of the programme for themselves appear important.</p><p id="Par50">Positive experiences generally centre around the impact of befriending on the befriendee and own changes in attitudes toward mental illness, while negative experiences related to feeling unappreciated by the befriendee or bad experiences with the befriending organisation. Volunteers had mixed feelings about their relationship with paid mental health professionals and tend to perceive a lack of clarity surrounding their role as a befriender.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par51">To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review focusing on the characteristics, motivations and experiences of befrienders in mental health care. It provides a summary of the different motivations and experiences of befriender volunteers that appear plausible and are in line with previous literature on volunteering. It covers a significant number of befrienders, but also a range of countries, and languages (English and German) exceeding those in a previous wider review on different types of volunteering in mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A further strength is that to reduce the publication bias, unpublished literature and hand searches of relevant journals were performed to maximise the search. In addition, the themes of the narrative synthesis were identified across a diversity of papers and were discussed within the multidisciplinary team of the co-authors to reduce bias of findings.</p><p id="Par52">The study, however, has several limitations. First, whilst the total number of 577 included befrienders may allow more general conclusions than previously possible, it is still small in the light of the wide use of befriending schemes in some countries, particularly considering that data on 360 befrienders were from only one large survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Secondly, all papers are from a limited number of high-income countries, and there remains a lack of information about what types of befriending programmes, if any, exist in other countries and what the characteristics of the befrienders in those programmes are. Thirdly, although it was possible to extract some qualitative data about the motivations and experiences of volunteers, papers included only a few quotations, and hence the available data was limited to conduct the narrative synthesis. Fourthly, the quantitative data extracted for this review were not consistently reported, which makes it difficult to synthesise the data and compare studies. Finally, with respect to experiences, one may assume that most studies were biased through the selection of interviewees. Befrienders with very negative experiences are more likely to end their befriending sooner and avoid participation in research interviews than those who liked their befriending role and did it for longer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Comparison with the literature</title><p id="Par53">Whilst the earlier wider review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] identified details on only 63 volunteer befrienders, this review found reports on an additional 514 befrienders. Given that the previous review covered the whole period of time since the inception of the included databases and this one added only eight years, the increase of research data on befrienders may reflect a rising research interest in befriending programmes.</p><p id="Par54">The findings here are consistent with those reported by Hallett and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is in regards to the predominance of women among befrienders, the otherwise wide range of socio-demographic characteristics, the mix of motivations of &#x0201c;giving&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;getting&#x0201d; for volunteer befrienders, and the mostly positive but still mixed experiences of befrienders.</p><p id="Par55">The categorisation of motivations into &#x0201c;giving&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;getting&#x0201d; reflects one of the four dimensions of the &#x02018;Octagon Model&#x02019; which has been used to describe the motivations of volunteers in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Klug and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] applied such categorisations in their assessment of volunteer motivations. They identified four subgroups of befrienders based on their characteristics (age, gender, marital status and employment status), which were associated with different motivations to engage in befriending. The largest subgroup included married, retired females (median age&#x02009;=&#x02009;64), which were largely motivated by their responsibility to help others. This motivation was also predominant in two other subgroups, comprised of married retired males (median age&#x02009;=&#x02009;58), and married females in full-time employment (median age&#x02009;=&#x02009;51). The final subgroup consisted of single females in full-time employment (median age&#x02009;=&#x02009;44). The most frequent motivations in the four groups were similar and included aspects of both &#x02018;giving&#x02019; and &#x02018;getting&#x02019;. Only the fourth and youngest group differed in some aspects from the other groups and stated more often the wish to acquire new skills and career aspirations as motivations. It remains unclear to what extent different subgroups of befrienders may respond to different recruitment strategies and benefit from different types of programmes and supervision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Implications</title><p id="Par56">The fact that there is a wide variation in the characteristics of volunteer befrienders, including employment and relationship status, suggests that a typical volunteer befriender does not exist and that there is a potential to recruit volunteers for befriending programmes from very different groups in the population. The majority of befrienders being female might reflect gender differences in attitudes, social roles or both. The motivations of different groups and their potentials to engage in specific befriending programmes are likely to vary, and more research is required to tailor recruitment strategies and programmes for people with different backgrounds, interests and social situations. In particular, additional qualitative research should be conducted to further explore the motivations and experiences of different volunteers. Studies with sufficiently large samples should allow the exploration of potentially relevant subgroups, of&#x000a0;which only one study has been able to do&#x000a0;so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Allowing volunteering opportunities that are consistent with volunteers&#x02019; motivations may improve volunteers&#x02019; satisfaction and retention in these programmes. Equally, exploring the experiences in more detail may help with designing programmes that maximise the satisfaction of befrienders and encourage them to stay in programmes or volunteer again if they had engaged previously and since ceased participating.</p><p id="Par58">Whilst this review summarised data of research publications, this is still limited and inconsistently reported. Therefore, in the future, data about volunteers should be routinely collected and published on a large scale to map out and further develop befriending programmes. This is currently hindered by a number of factors, one of which being that many programmes are run outside mainstream health services with less developed data documentation systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">The results reported in this review suggest an increased attention to befriending programmes in research over the last eight years. Apart from most&#x000a0;befrienders being female, the variability of characteristics of befrienders suggests that generalised conclusions are difficult. At the same time, it may underline the wide potential to establish more befriending programmes in different contexts, whilst the different motivations and experiences of befrienders point to possibilities for refining and specifying programmes for different types of befrienders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
