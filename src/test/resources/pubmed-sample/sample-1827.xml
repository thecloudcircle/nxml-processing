Background and Importance</title><p>Patients with moyamoya disease are at risk for developing aneurysms. Moyamoya disease is characterized by progressive stenosis of the internal carotid artery with subsequent development of convoluted collateral vessels [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dysregulation of cerebral blood flow is thought to contribute to aneurysm formation in a variety of locations and increased susceptibility to ischemia and hemorrhage. Yamashita et al. theorize that moyamoya patients are predisposed to hemorrhage due to weakened vessel media and increased fibrosis of collateral vessels, which are physiologically primed for aneurysm formation [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Aneurysms of collateral vessels are often in deep locations, such as the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Conventional microsurgical approaches for the treatment of these deeply located aneurysms can lead to white matter injury and ischemia of surrounding parenchyma. Prolonged retraction can predispose patients to seizures, venous infarction, and swelling [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Endovascular embolization offers another treatment modality, although vessel tortuosity may preclude access to these distal aneurysms.</p><p>Development of minimally invasive techniques has been proposed to reduce complications associated with brain retraction. In particular, endoport-assisted microsurgery has shown promising results in minimizing complications associated with treatment of deep cerebral pathology, including periventricular lesions [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We present a novel application of an endoport system for the treatment of a ruptured periventricular aneurysm in a patient with moyamoya disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Clinical Presentation</title><p>A 34-year-old female with a moyamoya disease and a prior history of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) presented to an outside hospital with headache, nausea, and vomiting. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed significant IVH. Subsequent CT angiogram (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref>) demonstrated a periventricular aneurysm in the wall of the atrium of the right lateral ventricle supplied by tortuous vessels arising from the posterior choroidal artery. The patient was subsequently transferred to our institution for further management and was neurologically nonfocal on arrival. The patient was then taken to the neurointerventional suite after a preoperative CTA (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(f)</xref>). However, distal access to the aneurysm could not be safely achieved via endovascular approach, and embolization could not be performed without sacrificing the arterial supply to the adjacent brain parenchyma. Super-selective catheterization of the posterior choroidal artery demonstrated that significant parenchyma was supplied by distal collaterals. Therefore, we elected to proceed with endoport-assisted microsurgical treatment of the aneurysm.</p><p>The techniques of endoport-assisted microsurgery at our institution have been described previously [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Briefly, the patient was placed into three-point cranial fixation in the prone position using a Mayfield Skull Clamp system (Integra, Plainsboro, NJ, USA), and the StealthStation frameless stereotactic neuronavigation system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to determine the optimal trajectory for direct visualization of the aneurysm from a transcortical parietal approach. A craniotomy over the planned entry point, measuring approximately 4&#x02009;cm in diameter, was created and a small cruciate dural opening was made.</p><p>The BrainPath endoport system (NICO Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used for the approach. The endoport system consists of an outer sheath and an inner obturator. The outer sheath is 13.5&#x02009;mm in diameter with variable lengths of 50&#x02009;mm, 60&#x02009;mm, and 75&#x02009;mm. The sheath is left in place once desired position is obtained and allows for fixation to a Greenberg retractor system. The inner obturator has a blunt, tapered tip which extends 15&#x02009;mm beyond the outer sheath and allows for gradual cannulation of the brain parenchyma by the endoport system. Under constant image guidance, a 50&#x02009;mm BrainPath sheath was advanced along the planned route into the atrium of the right lateral ventricle. Acute hematoma under moderately high pressure was encountered when the inner obturator was removed. This was easily evacuated, and the sheath was advanced further into the atrium. A portion of the ependymal roof of the right lateral ventricle was resected to expose the complex of vessels and the aneurysm. Intraoperatively, the aneurysm appeared larger than expected, likely due to partial thrombosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). However, due to the fusiform architecture of the aneurysm, clip reconstruction could not be successfully performed without occluding the distal outflow. A temporary clip was placed on the inflow vessel to achieve proximal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>), and the aneurysm was ligated with electrocautery. The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit postoperatively and was transferred to the regular ward on postoperative day one. Postoperative CT angiography demonstrated reduced intraventricular hemorrhage and no evidence of residual aneurysm (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(e)</xref>). The patient was discharged home on postoperative day three.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Periventricular aneurysms are extremely rare, with less than 60 cases reported in the literature, 19 of which were associated with moyamoya disease [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Most periventricular aneurysms are believed to develop secondary to malignant hypertension, infection, or arteriovenous malformation, although some are thought to be idiopathic [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite their deep location, periventricular aneurysms have been treated using modalities similar to those utilized for aneurysms arising from more common locations.</p><p>Conservative management has been proposed, since smaller aneurysms may regress spontaneously [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but some cases treated conservatively have resulted in death [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Endovascular embolization is a viable option for periventricular aneurysms in moyamoya disease patients as it prevents disruption of collateral vessels and avoids the risk of ischemia and parenchymal damage associated with a microsurgical approach [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Patients with deep-seated aneurysms generally respond well to endovascular intervention, although the size of the parent artery is a crucial determinant of success [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a case series investigating patients with moyamoya disease, endovascular embolization resulted in complete obliteration of aneurysms in seven out of eight patients (88%) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, no complications were observed in the postoperative period, and six patients had full recovery at discharge (75%) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, successful endovascular embolization in moyamoya patients can be challenging, since the collateral vessels may be tortuous and prone to rupture [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Microsurgical clipping has been the traditional treatment for aneurysms, but the risk of intraoperative rupture may be higher when treating deep-seated aneurysms. In addition, craniotomy and prolonged brain retraction can be associated with increased morbidity. Hence, minimally invasive approaches, such as miniature craniotomies and endoscopy, have been utilized for the treatment of deep intracranial pathology, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>Compared to other minimally invasive methods available for periventricular aneurysm treatment, endoport-assisted microsurgery is a novel method to gain access to deep intracranial pathology. We present the first report of endoport-assisted treatment of an intracranial aneurysm. The endoport may be associated with a lower risk of retraction-induced complications since the endoport distributes force evenly over surrounding tissues, in contrast to the uneven force applied by the retractor blades in conventional microsurgery [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our case, the endoport also allowed evacuation of the intraventricular blood clot, which may reduce the need for permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Despite these early reports of success with the endoport, the endoport system is limited by its dependence on neuronavigation and an impaired range of motion due to the device's rigidity [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, due to restricted peripheral visualization, endoport use is best applied to pathologies with diameters smaller than that of the endoport [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Calcified lesions and those with a diameter greater than 3&#x02009;cm may significantly hamper resection through an endoport [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite these caveats, the endoport provides a suitable minimally invasive alternative to conventional microsurgical approaches for the treatment of aneurysms in deep intracranial locations not amenable to endovascular embolization.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>Periventricular aneurysms are rare cerebrovascular entities, although patients with moyamoya disease may be predisposed to developing these lesions. Endoport-assisted microsurgery is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective treatment approach for periventricular and similarly deep-seated intracranial aneurysms.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors have no competing interests.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B13"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment strategies for aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease</article-title><source><italic>International Journal of Medical Sciences</italic></source><year>2015</year><volume>12</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>234</fpage><lpage>242</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7150/ijms.10837</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25678840</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B11"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Oka</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Histopathology of the brain vascular network in moyamoya disease</article-title><source><italic>Stroke</italic></source><year>1983</year><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>50</fpage><lpage>58</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1161/01.str.14.1.50</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-0020678797</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6823686</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B8"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>S.
