The <italic>lys5f</italic> (ADPglucose transporter), <italic>wax</italic> (granule-bound starch synthase), <italic>isa1</italic> (debranching enzyme isoamylase 1) and <italic>sex6</italic> (starch synthase IIa) mutations were introgressed into NFC Tipple to give mutant and wild-type BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families with different genomic contributions of the donor parent. Comparison of starch and grain properties between the donor parents, the BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families and NFC Tipple allowed the effects of the mutations to be distinguished from genetic background effects. The <italic>wax</italic> and <italic>sex6</italic> mutations had marked effects on starch properties regardless of genetic background. The <italic>sex6</italic> mutation conditioned low grain weight and starch content, but the <italic>wax</italic> mutation did not. The <italic>lys5</italic> mutation conditioned low grain weight and starch content, but exceptionally high &#x003b2;-glucan contents. The <italic>isa</italic>1 mutation promotes synthesis of soluble &#x003b1;-glucan (phytoglycogen). Its introgression into NFC Tipple increased grain weight and total &#x003b1;-glucan content relative to the donor parent, but reduced the ratio of phytoglycogen to starch. This study shows that introgression of mutations into a common, commercial background provides new insights that could not be gained from the donor parent.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Four barley starch synthesis mutations were introgressed from diverse backgrounds into an elite variety.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p><italic>wax</italic> and <italic>sex6</italic> mutations had marked effects on starch properties regardless of genetic background.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p><italic>sex6</italic> and <italic>lys5</italic> mutations reduced grain weight, but the <italic>lys5</italic> mutation led to very high &#x003b2;-glucan contents.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Introgression reduced the phytoglycogen (soluble &#x003b1;-glucan) to starch ratio in <italic>isa1</italic> mutants.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Barley mutant</kwd><kwd>Barley starch</kwd><kwd>Starch properties</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The aim of this work was to characterise variation for starch properties in barley, and to provide new barley germplasm for evaluation of the commercial potential of this variation. Starch is the main component of barley grains, and the substrate for production of alcohol in the barley-based drinks industries.</p><p>The commercial application and value of a particular starch depends on its physical properties, including gelatinisation profile, gel and paste properties, and susceptibility to hydrolysis. Much starch used by industry is chemically, physically or enzymatically modified to tailor its properties to specific end uses (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Huber and BeMiller, 2009</xref>). Industry also exploits naturally-occurring variation for starch properties within and between starch crops. For example, starch from the <italic>waxy</italic> mutant of maize gelatinises to form clear pastes with specific applications in the food industry, and &#x0201c;high-amylose&#x0201d; maize starch (from the <italic>amylose-extender</italic> mutant) is particularly valued for its film-forming properties (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Jobling, 2004</xref>). Naturally-occurring variation in starch properties also influences the quality of foods made from starch crops. For example, the <italic>waxy</italic> mutant of rice has eating properties that are particularly prized in East Asia, and flour from high-amylose maize gives baked products with low glycaemic indices because of the resistance of the starch to digestion in the gut (<xref rid="bib2 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Behall and Hallfrisch, 2002; Nugent, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Some variation for starch properties exists within commercial barley varieties. A variety containing starch with a high amylose content (<xref rid="bib3 bib13 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Bird et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Morell et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Topping et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) is marketed as a healthy breakfast cereal in Australia, and varieties with different kinds of resistant starch (starch that escapes digestion in the upper gut and enters the large bowel) are under development (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Regina et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Waxy barley is cultivated in North America because its flour confers freeze-thaw and antistaling properties to processed food. Waxy barley is also sold as a health food because the grains have a high content of beta-glucan, an important component of dietary fibre (<xref rid="bib1 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Baik and Ullrich, 2008; Ullrich et&#x000a0;al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>A wide range of variation for starch structure and properties exists within barley germplasm collections, but is not currently commercially exploited. Many different mutants with altered granule composition and/or morphology have been reported (e.g. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">DeHaas et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Oscarsson et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Patron et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Tester et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>). The introduction of novel variation into high-yielding commercial cultivars could potentially open new markets for barley, and generate new products. However, progress in evaluating starch variation in germplasm collections for this purpose is slow because the variation is scattered through many different genetic backgrounds. It is difficult to determine the extent to which a given starch property is modulated by genetic background, or whether altered starch properties may have negative impacts on desirable traits including yield.</p><p>To overcome these problems, potentially important starch traits could be transferred to a common, elite genetic background. To this end, we used marker-assisted selection to transfer four different mutations with major effects on starch properties from diverse accessions (donor parents) into the UK elite variety NFC Tipple (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Howell et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Here we compare properties of grain from the mutant and wild-type parental lines with those of grain from a series of recombinant BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families, each with different proportions of donor genotype. The results allow meaningful evaluation of the effects of different mutations on starch and grain properties, and the impact of genetic background on these properties.</p><p>The four mutations condition different starch properties and come from three very different genetic backgrounds. Our choices thus maximise both the research and exploitation value of the introgression lines from a starch perspective, and the amount of other genetic diversity introduced into NFC Tipple for future studies. Two of the mutations (<italic>sex6</italic> and <italic>wax</italic>) have already been exploited commercially in other genetic backgrounds, providing potentially useful comparisons of genetic background effects. The other two mutations bring about starch and grain properties that are not found in existing commercial cultivars of barley. The genes affected were as follows.</p><p>The gene at the <italic>sex6</italic> locus encodes starch synthase IIa (SSIIa; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Morell et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Starch from the mutant is highly resistant to digestion, and grains have health benefits including low glycaemic indices and high soluble fibre (e.g. <xref rid="bib3 bib19 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Bird et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Rahman et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Topping et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The gene at the <italic>lys5</italic> locus encodes an ADPglucose transporter, responsible for transferring ADPglucose synthesised in the cytosol into the amyloplast where it is the substrate for starch synthesis (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Patron et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). The gene at the <italic>wax</italic> locus encodes granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI). The mutation conditions the loss of amylose from endosperm starch (<xref rid="bib10 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa et&#x000a0;al., 1995; Patron et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Amylose-free and low-amylose starches have food applications because of their low gelatinisation temperatures, high peak and low final viscosities, and high freeze-thaw stability (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Baik and Ullrich, 2008</xref>). The gene at the <italic>isa1</italic> locus encodes isoamylase 1, a starch debranching enzyme. Barley <italic>isa1</italic> mutants (Ris&#x000f8;17 and Notch2) have low starch contents, but high contents of a soluble &#x003b1;-glucan, phytoglycogen (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burton et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Plant material</title><p>Development of recombinant pre-breeding lines from crosses between NFC Tipple and four barley accessions carrying mutations affecting starch synthesis was described in <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Howell et&#x000a0;al.

This result is consistent with the established importance of the proteins encoded by the <italic>lys5</italic> and <italic>sex6</italic> genes. The ADPglucose transporter of the plastid envelope (encoded by <italic>lys5</italic>) is essential for normal rates of starch synthesis not only in barley but also in maize endosperm, where it is encoded by <italic>Brittle1</italic> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Shannon et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). Starch synthase IIa (encoded by <italic>sex6</italic>) is also essential for normal rates of starch synthesis in maize and wheat endosperm (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Konik-Rose et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Barley lines carrying these mutations are thus likely to be intrinsically low yielding, regardless of genetic background.</p><p>Introgression of the <italic>isa1</italic> mutation into an NFC Tipple background showed that the low grain weight and starch content of the donor is partly due to genetic background, and probably partly due to <italic>isa1</italic> itself. Mutant BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families had higher grain weight and starch content than the donor parent, but values were lower than those of wild-type controls and NFC Tipple even for the BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> family with the lowest genomic contribution of the donor parent. Because mutant BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families had phytoglycogen contents per g flour similar to those of the donor parent but higher starch contents than the donor parent, introgression of the <italic>isa1</italic> mutation into NFC Tipple was accompanied by an increase in the starch to phytoglycogen ratio.</p><p>The starch to phytoglycogen ratio in <italic>isa1</italic> mutants of maize [<italic>sugary1</italic> (<italic>su1</italic>) mutants] is also strongly influenced by genetic background. In three rounds of divergent recurrent selection for high starch or high phytoglycogen in a maize population homozygous for a <italic>su1</italic> mutation, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Tracey and Chang (2007)</xref> were able to generate lines with starch to phytoglycogen ratios ranging from 1.0 to 2.1. As in our study, high starch to phytoglycogen ratios were strongly correlated with high seed weight. Taken together, these results suggest that relatively high grain weight and &#x003b1;-glucan contents can be achieved in barley carrying the <italic>isa1</italic> mutation, but such material will have high starch to phytoglycogen ratios.</p><p>As expected from previous studies of <italic>wax</italic> barley, the <italic>wax</italic> mutation had little consequence for starch content (e.g. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Oscarsson et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>): the donor parent and BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families had starch contents generally comparable with those of NFC Tipple. <italic>Wax</italic> mutants of other cereals also have essentially normal starch contents (e.g. wheat, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Graybosch et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; maize, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Creech, 1965</xref>).

This difference was not simply due to the lower starch content of three donor parents, because introgression of the mutations into NFC Tipple affected the relationship between starch and &#x003b2;-glucan differently in each case. In agreement with these results, previous studies reported high &#x003b2;-glucan contents in grains of the <italic>lys5</italic> donor parent Ris&#x000f8;13 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Munck et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>: 2.8 times the content of the wild-type parent Bomi) and in the <italic>sex6</italic> mutant Himalaya 292 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Topping et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>: twice as high as standard barley). However, grain of BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families carrying the <italic>lys5</italic>, <italic>isa1</italic> or <italic>sex6</italic> mutations all had lower &#x003b2;-glucan contents than that of the donor parents, even though their starch contents were very differently affected [ranging from the same as the donor parent (<italic>lys5</italic>) to twice as high (<italic>isa1</italic>)]. In the case of <italic>isa1</italic> and <italic>sex6</italic> mutant families, grain &#x003b2;-glucan contents were similar to those of NFC Tipple. It seems unlikely that either gene plays a major role in determining &#x003b2;-glucan content. Nonetheless, all families carrying the <italic>sex6</italic> mutation had higher ratios of &#x003b2;-glucan to starch than NFC Tipple. The &#x003b2;-glucan content was 13% of the starch content for the low-donor family and 6% of the starch content for NFC Tipple. In contrast, the low-donor BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> family carrying the <italic>lys5</italic> mutation had three times more &#x003b2;-glucan than NFC Tipple. It also had more than twice as much &#x003b2;-glucan as the <italic>sex6</italic> BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> family, despite that fact that the two families had comparable starch contents.</p><p>Although the <italic>wax</italic> donor parent had a relatively modest elevation in &#x003b2;-glucan content in relation to NFC Tipple, this effect was maintained in the mutant BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> family. This observation suggests that <italic>wax</italic> itself conditions elevated &#x003b2;-glucan content. Correlations between <italic>wax</italic> mutations and high &#x003b2;-glucan contents have been widely observed in barley, in many different backgrounds and for different <italic>wax</italic> mutant alleles (e.g. <xref rid="bib1 bib14 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Baik and Ullrich, 2008; Munck et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Ullrich et&#x000a0;al., 1986</xref>). The reasons for this correlation are not known. Because <italic>wax</italic> mutations do not alter total starch content, the elevated &#x003b2;-glucan content cannot be due to diversion of carbon from amylose synthesis to &#x003b2;-glucan synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Starch properties</title><p>The properties of starch from grain of the <italic>sex6</italic> donor parent and BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families carrying this mutation were radically different from those of NFC Tipple and the other donor parents and BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families. The starch had very low crystallinity (indicated by the low enthalpy change on gelatinisation) and high heterogeneity (indicated by the wide gelatinisation peak). These properties are consistent with those reported for <italic>sex6</italic> mutants in a different genetic background (Himalaya: <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Morell et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). They reflect the radically altered chain length distribution of the amylopectin fraction of starch, the high apparent amylose content and heterogeneous and distorted nature of starch granules from <italic>sex6</italic> mutants (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Morell et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Loss of the SSII isoform of starch synthase also has a very strong influence on amylopectin structure and hence on granule structure in wheat (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yamamori et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>) and maize (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) endosperm.</p><p>Although the properties of starch from the <italic>isa1</italic> donor parent were distinctly different from those of NFC Tipple, at least some of the differences were effects of genetic background. For example, starch from the donor parent had low crystallinity and low peak viscosity relative to NFC Tipple, whereas the mutant BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> family resembled NFC Tipple in these respects. This background effect may relate to the higher ratio of starch to phytoglycogen in the BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> family than in the donor parent. <italic>isa1</italic> mutant grain contains a wide range of &#x003b1;-glucan structures, ranging from soluble phytoglycogen to various sizes and shapes of granules and more amorphous material (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burton et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). It seems likely that insoluble &#x003b1;-glucan extracted from grain of the <italic>isa1</italic> donor parent contains both starch granules and more amorphous &#x003b1;-glucan material with distinct properties. The insoluble &#x003b1;-glucan from the <italic>isa1</italic> BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> family is likely to have a higher proportion of starch granules than that from the donor parent, and hence properties more like those of starch from NFC Tipple.</p><p>Examination of starch from the <italic>lys5</italic> donor parent and BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families provided no evidence for a strong influence of <italic>lys5</italic> on starch properties. This observation is consistent with the fact that the <italic>lys5</italic> mutation affects the supply of substrate for starch synthesis in the endosperm (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Patron et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>), whereas the other three mutations directly affect the synthesis of the starch polymers.</p><p>Starch from BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families carrying the <italic>wax</italic> mutation retained the properties generally associated with starches from amylose-free mutants of crop plants. Compared to NFC Tipple, the starch had high swelling power and freeze-thaw stability, high peak viscosity and low final viscosity. However, these parameters were affected to some extent by genetic background. For example, starch from mutant BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> families had lower swelling power than that of the donor parent, but enhanced freeze-thaw stability. Both of these properties are modulated by the fine structure of amylopectin, in particular the fraction of short glucose chains, and by numerous other factors including phosphate ester content and granule size (<xref rid="bib25 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Srichuwong et&#x000a0;al., 2005, 2012</xref>). Further analysis will therefore be required to determine which features of the genetic background contribute to the changes in starch properties that accompany introgression of the <italic>wax</italic> mutation into the NFC Tipple background.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Introgression of mutations affecting enzymes of starch synthesis into an elite variety by backcrossing has allowed the effects of the alleles to be assessed in a unified genetic background, revealing which starch and grain properties are directly conditioned by the mutations themselves, and which are modulated by genetic background. The <italic>lys5f</italic> allele used in this study conditions exceptionally high contents of &#x003b2;-glucan, much higher than those of <italic>wax</italic> mutants from which barley &#x003b2;-glucan is usually obtained commercially. However, unlike the <italic>wax</italic> mutation, this mutation conditions intrinsically low grain weight. Other mutant alleles of <italic>lys5</italic> (see <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Patron et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>) might offer more favourable combinations of grain weight and &#x003b2;-glucan content. Although further breeding to enhance grain weight in <italic>isa1</italic> mutant lines is likely to result in higher starch to phytoglycogen ratios, the presence of some phytoglycogen may have advantages for alcohol production and for some food applications. As reported previously, the <italic>sex6</italic> mutation strongly affects starch properties, resulting in a resistant starch with potential health benefits. However, grain weight and starch contents of lines carrying the <italic>sex6</italic> mutation are likely to be intrinsically low. The valuable starch properties of lines carrying the <italic>wax</italic> mutation are modified by genetic background. It seems likely that further breeding could enhance freeze-thaw stability in particular.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baik</surname><given-names>B.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ullrich</surname><given-names>S.E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Barley for food: characteristics, improvement and renewed interest</article-title><source>J.&#x000a0;Cereal Sci.</source><volume>48</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>233</fpage><lpage>242</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Behall</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hallfrisch</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Plasma glucose and insulin reduction after consumption of breads varying in amylose content</article-title><source>Eur.
