We studied the effects of sheep scrapie on lymphoid tissue in tonsils and lymph nodes by light and electron microscopy. FDCs of sheep were grouped according to morphology as immature, mature or regressing. Scrapie was associated with FDC dendrite hypertrophy and electron dense deposit or vesicles. PrP<sup>d</sup> was located using immunogold labelling at the plasmalemma of FDC dendrites and, infrequently, mature B cells. Abnormal electron dense deposits surrounding FDC dendrites were identified as immunoglobulins suggesting that excess immune complexes are retained and are indicative of an FDC dysfunction. Within scrapie-affected lymph nodes, macrophages outside the follicle and a proportion of germinal centre TBMs accumulated PrP<sup>d</sup> within endosomes and lysosomes. In addition, TBMs showed PrP<sup>d</sup> in association with the cell membrane, non-coated pits and vesicles, and also with discrete, large and random endoplasmic reticulum networks, which co-localised with ubiquitin. These observations suggest that PrP<sup>d</sup> is internalised via the caveolin-mediated pathway, and causes an abnormal disease-related alteration in endoplasmic reticulum structure. In contrast to current dogma, this study shows that sheep scrapie is associated with cytopathology of germinal centres, which we attribute to abnormal antigen complex trapping by FDCs and abnormal endocytic events in TBMs. The nature of the sub-cellular changes in FDCs and TBMs differs from those of scrapie infected neurones and glial cells suggesting that different PrP<sup>d</sup>/cell membrane interactions occur in different cell types.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Scrapie, a disease naturally affecting British sheep and goats for many years, belongs to a group of slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorders, the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases, which include infectious, familial and sporadic forms of disease in animals and man. The TSEs include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie of sheep and goats, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru and Gertsmann-Stra&#x00171;ssler syndrome (GSS) of humans. TSEs result in abnormal isoforms of a host-coded, cell-surface glycoprotein called prion protein (PrP).</p><p>Unlike the normal proteinase sensitive form of prion protein (PrP<sup>sen</sup>) abnormal PrP detected by immunoblotting methods is abnormally resistant to proteinase treatment and contains truncated, protease resistant forms of PrP often designated PrP<sup>res</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0001304-Silveira1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. While these biophysically altered forms of PrP are a reliable markers for the presence of infectivity, not all infectious preparations contain PrP<sup>res</sup>. Immunohistochemistry may also be used to detect disease-associated accumulations of PrP (PrP<sup>d</sup>). Unlike immunoblotting methods, immunohistochemistry detects abnormal PrP forms that may be truncated or full length, protease resistant or protease sensitive <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, often designated PrP<sup>d</sup>.</p><p>PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulates in the nervous system and lymphoreticular system (LRS) scrapie of sheep and variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease. In contrast with the CNS, where lesions are well known, it is commonly accepted that despite the presence of infectivity and PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation, there is no associated pathology in the lymphoreticular system of naturally occurring TSEs. Studies using severe combined immunodeficient mice and chimaeric mice indicate that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are necessary for prion propagation within the LRS <xref rid="pone.0001304-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition to FDCs, macrophages of the LRS have been identified as reservoirs of the TSE infectious agent <xref rid="pone.0001304-Carp1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Tingible body macrophages (TBMs), so named due to their dark-staining, phagocytosed nuclear remnants in their cytoplasmic vesicles, are normal constituents of the germinal centres of secondary lymphoid tissues <xref rid="pone.0001304-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and contain abundant PrP<sup>d</sup> as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in scrapie <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and vCJD <xref rid="pone.0001304-Hilton1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The exact mechanism by which infection reaches lymphoid follicles and FDCs remains unclear. However, FDCs are responsible for the trapping and retention of antigens in association with antibodies on their cell surface. This trapping is initiated by the interactions of complement and cellular complement receptors, and antibodies and their complementary receptors on the FDC plasmalemma <xref rid="pone.0001304-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Within affected lymph nodes of scrapie-affected sheep, most secondary follicles show PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation <xref rid="pone.0001304-VanKeulen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Normal gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) development is known to be related to age with Peyer's patches of young sheep constituting a major component of GALT. With the exception of the tonsil, GALT of sheep undergoes progressive involution at around the time of sexual maturity <xref rid="pone.0001304-Press1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-StRose1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, this involution may be delayed in scrapie-affected sheep <xref rid="pone.0001304-Gonzlez2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which might provisionally indicate a scrapie-related pathology in the LRS.</p><p>Labelling of CD21, which is expressed on FDC membranes and on B cells <xref rid="pone.0001304-Gonzlez3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, co-localises with PrP<sup>d</sup> immunolabelling only on cells morphologically similar to mature FDCs in the light zone of germinal centres of secondary follicles. In contrast, TBM labelling is present in the light, dark, mantle and paracortical zones <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. PrP<sup>d</sup> labelling has also been detected within mononuclear cells of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) and within the marginal zone of the spleen <xref rid="pone.0001304-Heggebo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Previous studies of TSE-affected sheep and mice have demonstrated that intracellular PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulations are truncated with the loss of the N-terminus amino acid sequence from approximately 23&#x02013;90, while all other types of PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation remain full length <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Sub-cellular morphological studies of spleens from mice terminally affected by scrapie, demonstrate that FDCs form abnormally convoluted labyrinthine structures, and irregular, excess electron-dense deposits associated with dendrites <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-McGovern1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Immunogold labelling for PrP<sup>d</sup> is mostly associated with the FDC dendrite plasmalemma and FDC dendrites engaged in plasmablast emperipolesis (i.e. FDC dendrite-encircled plasmablasts). PrP<sup>d</sup> is also present in TBM lysosomes. The absence of the N-terminus of intra-cellular PrP<sup>d</sup> in TBMs is consistent with the notion that TBMs internalize and digest extra-cellular PrP<sup>d</sup> derived from FDCs <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey5" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>In previous studies we have suggested that there are pathological changes associated with scrapie infection of splenic secondary follicles. To determine whether similar changes are present in natural disease, we have studied the morphological response and sub-cellular location of PrP<sup>d</sup> in scrapie-infected sheep LRS tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Light Microscopy&#x02013;wax</title><p>Consistent with previous results <xref rid="pone.0001304-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Gonzlez2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey5" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> serial sections of lymph nodes and tonsil germinal centres labelled with the N terminal antibody BG4 or the C terminal antibody R145 were found to show similar patterns of FDC-type labelling in all LRS tissues.

This study further shows that accumulation of PrP<sup>d</sup> is associated with the plasmalemmae of FDCs, a minority of mature B cells, and also with scrapie-related random fused tubular networks and lysosomes within TBMs. The first of these findings is consistent with those from scrapie-affected mice <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-McGovern1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>FDC from normal sheep tonsil and lymph nodes can be classified into three overlapping morphological categories, attributed to immature, mature and regressing stages. Immature FDCs are also present in scrapie-infected lymph nodes. Consistent with previous descriptions <xref rid="pone.0001304-Rademakers1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, these immature FDCs, or their precursors, have limited or absent dendritic extensions with no surrounding electron dense deposit. Absence of labelling with anti-globulin antibodies, suggests that they have had little or no exposure to immune complexes. Upon antigenic stimulation, the capacity of immature FDCs to produce matrix elements is lost, while adhesion molecules, complement and specific surface antigens, are created <xref rid="pone.0001304-Heinen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Immune stimulation of primary follicles leads to the development of germinal centre-containing secondary follicles as a result of the deposition of antigen/antibody complexes on the surface of FDCs. This stimulates the development of extended dendritic networks associated with mature FDCs as demonstrated by immunoglobulin labelling <xref rid="pone.0001304-Thorbecke1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Our results show that in regressing follicles of both scrapie affected and control sheep, immunoglobulin labelling is lacking and exosome-like structures are found in place of electron dense material between FDC dendrites.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that antigen/antibody complexes are fixed in the extracellular space adjacent to FDC membranes via the antibody attachment to FDC receptor molecules C3b and Fc <xref rid="pone.0001304-Bosseloir1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Mature FDCs present within lymph nodes of uninfected sheep have well developed dendritic extensions and small focal accumulations of electron dense deposit, which label for immunoglobulins consistent with exposure to, and subsequent accumulation of, immune complexes. The extracellular space around mature hypertrophic FDCs present within the germinal centres of lymph nodes of scrapie affected sheep consistently show a considerable excess of electron dense material when compared with controls. Because of its location, its similarities in density to that of immune complex material in uninfected animals <xref rid="pone.0001304-Radoux1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and the presence of immunoglobulins, we suggest that the excess of electron dense deposit correlates with abnormal accumulation of immunoglobulin.</p><p>The morphological changes of scrapie-infected FDC dendrites and accumulation of excess electron-dense material, suggest that the mechanisms of immune complex trapping is altered following scrapie infection. The electron dense space between dendritic profiles approximates to 1 micron, but antigen/antibody complex receptors confined to the plasma-membrane could retain complexes only to a distance of approximately 0.15 nanometers (nm) from it <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, not all of the presumed immune complexes can be trapped by receptors confined to the FDC plasmalemma. One possible explanation for the magnitude of antigen/antibody trapping is that primary FDC-associated immune complex may be capable of forming a large aggregate in association with complement, which is then capable of trapping additional immune complex.</p><p>Sparse vesicles are associated with the extracellular space between FDC dendrites in uninfected animals (regressing FDCs), but numerous vesicles may be present in scrapie-affected tissues (disease-associated mature type 2 FDCs). Vesicles are 50&#x02013;200 nm in diameter corresponding in size with exosomes; small membrane vesicles secreted by many cells as a result of endosomes or lysosomes fusing with the plasma-membrane. Vesicles at the surface of FDCs contain MHC-II molecules, but they do not synthesise them, suggesting that they are passively acquired from donor cells in the form of plasma membrane fragments, or exosomes, shed by B cells <xref rid="pone.0001304-Denzer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Denzer2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In vitro binding experiments demonstrate that exosomes secreted by B cells specifically bind to FDCs. Trapped immune complexes serve to periodically restimulate B cells, and this active process results in deposition of B cell-derived exosomes that facilitate recruitment of corresponding B and T cells <xref rid="pone.0001304-Denzer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. As the FDC matures, its capacity to trap immune complexes deteriorates <xref rid="pone.0001304-Szakal1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Szakal2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and this, we propose, may result in abundant trapping of exosomes alone. Morphologically similar regressing FDCs are present in both control and scrapie-affected tissues. We suggest that the scrapie-affected FDC reaches a stage of regression identical to that of controls, at which point it loses its capacity to trap immune complexes and retain exosomes-producing B cells. Although the life span of exosomes remains unclear, it seems possible that due to the scavenging nature of TBMs, at least a proportion will be digested in this manner. The hypothesised maturation process of FDCs is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001304-g008">Figure 8</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001304-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001304.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Diagram showing the maturation of normal and scrapie-affected follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).</title><p>Following antigenic stimulation, immature FDCs, present in both normal and scrapie-affected animals, develop into a mature form of FDC. In scrapie&#x02013;affected animals (grey), mature FDCs develop to form type disease-associated mature type 1 and subsequently disease-associated mature type 2 FDCs. We suggest the regression of normal mature and disease-associated mature type 2 FDCs results in the appearance of regressing FDCs within the germinal centre.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001304.g008"/></fig><p>PrP<sup>d</sup> was present at the cell membrane of a small proportion of B cells. Survival of B cells within the germinal centre depends on whether their surface immunoglobulins are bound to antigens retained by the FDC. Specific antigens will bind to B cells in the form of immune complexes via the cell surface immunoglobulin receptor. During this process, we hypothesise that PrP<sup>d</sup>, present at the plasmalemma of the FDC may be passively transferred to the B cell plasmalemma. Were this not so, PrP<sup>d</sup> would be processed and presented in a similar manner to antigenic proteins in association with MHC-II molecules. As such it would not be recognisable by the PrP antibody, nor would it be in an organised linear manner on the plasmalemma of the cell.</p><p>Pulse-chase experiments were the first to suggest that the transformation of normal to abnormal PrP may take place at the cell surface or at a later stage in the cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0001304-Caughey1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In brain, PrP<sup>d</sup> also accumulates on the cell surface <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey6" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and may be transferred between cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (unpublished observations) and <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0001304-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Similarly, TG3 PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mice, which express PrP only on astrocytes but not neurons, show PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation and associated pathology on the non PrP-expressing neurons <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey7" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We suggest that PrP<sup>d</sup> first accumulates at the plasmalemma of FDCs where it is then either transferred to adjacent cells to be retained on the plasma-membrane as it the case for B cells. Although exosomes transfer infectivity between cultured cells <xref rid="pone.0001304-Fevrier1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we can see no evidence that exosomes in germinal centres are PrP<sup>d</sup> positive. A mechanism for this transfer process is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001304-g009">Figure 9</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001304-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001304.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Diagram of the proposed mechanisms of PrP<sup>d</sup> transfer and internalisation.</title><p>a.

TBMs can also ingest material from the extracellular space via clathrin or caveolin mediated endocytosis. Uptake of extracellular molecules is specifically mediated via receptors in caveolae <xref rid="pone.0001304-Pelkmans1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Once internalised, caveolae travel to caveosomes where the ligands or membrane constituents may reside or be transported to the golgi or the ER. Random tubular networks, similar to those identified within TBMs in this study, were originally observed in simian virus 40 (SV40) infected cells. Such networks are extensions of the ER, formed following caveolin&#x02013;mediated internalisation of certain ligands including SV40 and autocrine motility factor <xref rid="pone.0001304-Maul1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Kartenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001304-Benlimame1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Alteration to the normal polygonal network of ER occurs following extension of the ER membrane and the subsequent absence of concomitant organising membrane proteins, leading to the collapse of the rigidly organised structure into the random arrangement <xref rid="pone.0001304-Sprocati1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In lymph nodes of scrapie affected sheep, inferred caveolin&#x02013;mediated endocytosis results in the presence of abundant PrP<sup>d</sup> in association with the membranes of random fused tubular extensions of the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001304-g007">Fig 7</xref>). This suggests that PrP<sup>d</sup> may complex with other proteins to alter the normal endocytosis pathway and interfere with organising membrane proteins of the ER, perhaps also leading to an abnormal ER-lysosomal degradation pathway as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001304-g010">Figure 10</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001304-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001304.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Diagram showing the process of internalisation of PrP<sup>d</sup>.</title><p>More detailed schematic diagram showing a possible internalisation mechanism of PrP<sup>d</sup> in tingible body macrophages (TBMs).

Thus, in the same scrapie infected sheep, PrP<sup>d</sup> is internalised via ubiquitin-initiated clathrin endocytosis in neurons, while ubiquitin-initiated putative caveolin-mediated endocytosis occurs within lymphoreticular tissues. As normal PrP is not a trans-membrane protein, it must complex with an adjacent trans-membrane receptor ligand to be ubiquitinated and internalised <xref rid="pone.0001304-Shyng1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Because different intracellular endocytosis mechanisms were observed at the cell surface of the same scrapie infected sheep, the molecule(s) interacting with PrP<sup>d</sup> at the cell surface are likely to be cell and not strain dependent.</p><p>As ER-associated PrP<sup>d</sup> has not been subjected to hydrolytic digestion, one would assume full length PrP<sup>d</sup> will be present. We therefore further propose that the PrP<sup>d</sup> labelled ER networks within TBMs correlate with the single intracellular granules of PrP<sup>d</sup> labelling observed following application of extreme N terminus antibody BG4 <xref rid="pone.0001304-Jeffrey5" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, several morphological changes are present in natural sheep scrapie-infected lymphoid tissue. In contrast to the dogma that scrapie does not functionally affect non-CNS tissues, we show that scrapie infection induces PrP<sup>d</sup> related changes in the maturation of FDCs and probable immune complex trapping and processing. TBMs demonstrate a disease-related alteration to the normal caveolin-mediated endocytic mechanism and subsequent ER formation which differs from that of neurons in the same sheep.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Ten sheep naturally infected and with clinical signs of scrapie, and four uninfected control animals from New Zealand were perfused via the carotid artery under deep surgical anaesthesia with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde, 0.1&#x00025; glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.
