In fact, the aggregation of disease occurrence data affects the patterns of geographical distribution, as well as the analysis of potential factors that could promote its development.</p><p id="Par20">In the analysis of health data, both spatial and temporal aggregated numbers are usually considered in order to preserve the individual&#x02019;s confidentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In many diseases, like cancer, the aggregation level tends to be higher, not only due to the needs of data confidentiality, but also to increase the rates&#x02019; statistical robustness.</p><p id="Par21">However, as a result of the spatial aggregation of data, the number of geographical areas under analysis decreases and a reduction of geographical variation of disease patterns occurs. Thus, the aggregation of data is responsible for a decreased possibility of detecting clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Conversely, when the spatial aggregation and population at risk are small, the rates&#x02019; statistical robustness tends to diminish. In these situations, higher values of the disease&#x02019;s rate generally tend to cluster in areas with small populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This effect is known as the &#x0201c;small numbers problem.&#x0201d;</p><p id="Par23">Consequently, it seems that there is a duality between aggregated data usage. On the one hand, disaggregated data are needed to obtain more accurate results in spatial data analysis. On the other hand, lower disaggregation tends to better preserve individual&#x02019;s confidentiality and contribute to more robust rates. This issue is not actually recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but it is still timely. There isn&#x02019;t a common correct spatial scale to analyze all disease data types in different geographic locations. Thus, there remains the need to choose the most suitable spatial level of aggregation depending on the data under study.</p><p id="Par24">Similarly, the choice of the most appropriate methods to fulfill the objectives is crucial to obtain more reliable findings. In cancer research, Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) is traditionally and widely used to calculate and map mortality data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, SMR may not be the best choice if the population dimension under analysis is small. Actually, the variability of rates tends to be more frequent in areas with small populations. As result, it can be difficult to separate real differences of rates from fluctuations due the rates&#x02019; instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">One possible way to improve stability of small number rates could be using smoothing methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Among the methods applied to smooth SMR, the spatial autoregressive model Besag, York and Molli&#x000e9; (BYM) is commonly used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The aim of this paper is to discuss a methodology which allows to choose a spatial aggregation level that suits the analysis of mortality data from all malignant cancer in mainland Portugal in 2009&#x02013;2013. To achieve that, we: a) compared three different levels of spatial administrative units: Parishes, Municipalities and Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (level III); and b) we employed different methods of data analysis, namely, Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR), Global and Local Moran&#x02019;s I, and Besag, York and Molli&#x000e9; Model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par27">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents a general view of the process of data collection and analysis.

In the end we opted for the method and level which, on the one hand, ensures more statistical significance of the results, and on the other hand allows to clearly identify where high values of mortality form clusters.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, in terms of software used<italic>,</italic> geographic computation was performed in ArcGIS 10.4 and R-INLA and the statistical analysis in IBM SPSS 22 and Excel 2016.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par32">Data used was aggregated both spatial and temporally.

Quartile 3 values present the same behavior (99.82 for NUTS III, 103.92 for municipalities, and 108.33 for parishes). In turn, quartile 1 has an inverse behavior (92.07 for NUTS III, 88.14 for municipalities, and 68.36 for parishes), which emphasizes the higher dispersion of values at small areas analysis.</p><p id="Par76">Regarding the effect of population density in rates, extreme values of SMR (such as 0 or 400) were verified in parishes which had low population density.

In the neighborhood of the southwest cluster there were two small High-Low clusters, which pointed to the possibility of the existence of outliers. There was another High-Low cluster, isolated, in the center east. There were also four Low-Low clusters, one in the north, and the other three in the northwest. It was also relevant to notice the two Low-High clusters, one joined to the North cluster and the other together with one of the other clusters.

Although, relative risk exhibits a pattern of high values in a track which was extended from Lisbon to the southeast, in areas in the south and in coastal north. These patterns are supported by the map of PP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, bottom left), which presents similar patterns, composed by municipalities with PP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.8 of relative risk being higher than 1.</p><p id="Par87">In turn, the distribution of high values of RR was more disperse in the parishes&#x02019; map than in the municipalities&#x02019; map. In addition, the PP of RR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, bottom right) was higher than 0.8 in only a few of these parishes.</p><p id="Par88">These results were reflected in the boxplots of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, which showed a higher number of outliers in parishes&#x02019; data than in municipalities&#x02019; data.

In fact, 85&#x02013;94% is the predominant class in all considered levels, with the exception of the parishes (in which this is &#x0003c;&#x02009;85%).</p><p id="Par93">However, in comparing the proportion of extreme classes (&#x0003c;&#x02009;85% and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;115%), we point out that the unit percentage in these classes decreases with spatial bundling of data. These results are aligned with the knowledge that sparse populations can be associated with a rate&#x02019;s extreme values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">We can also infer that larger geographic units under analysis tend to mask internal heterogeneity of data and that smooth mortality rates differ between areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">In terms of statistical significance, we verified that the higher the data spatial aggregation, the greater the percentage of areas with statistically significant SMR values.</p><p id="Par96">The coefficient of variation pattern is similar. Although all histograms presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> have a left skewed curve, the interval of variation of CV values increase with the decrease of spatial aggregation. These results show the decrease of result homogeneity with the geographical units diminishing (with more than a half of parishes with CV&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20%) These results are according with Openshaw&#x02019;s studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par97">With regards to clustering, and based on Moran&#x02019;s I results, we can affirm with 99% confidence that the distribution pattern of mortality by malignant cancer in mainland Portugal is clustered (for all spatial levels of analysis).</p><p id="Par98">LISA results, in turn, differ according to spatial scale of analysis. In their evaluation it is important to take into account that a higher geographical aggregation corresponds to a lower capacity of cluster detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If data have a high spatial disaggregation, problems related with extreme rate values can appear, derived from small populations in geographical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par99">It is interesting to point out that the clusters of the parishes present some similarities with the municipalities, despite them being smaller than in the other levels. It should also be noted that there are clusters in the center east that there are not identified in the other levels.</p><p id="Par100">It is also relevant to see if there are situations where a cluster in one scale corresponds to a cluster of the same type in all the related areas in a less aggregated scale. From the map analyses, we can see that both NUT III &#x0201c;Grande Lisboa&#x0201d; and all municipalities that compose it are classified as High-High clusters. In contrast, there is not any municipality belonging to a cluster (High-High or Low-Low) for which all the correspondent parishes are also integrated in a cluster.</p><p id="Par101">The results discussed in the last paragraph could possibly be different if we had used the current delimitation of parishes. The Portuguese parish delimitation changed in 2013, and the 4050 parishes of mainland Portugal were rearranged to only 2882 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, we decided to not adopt that delimitation because our temporal period was previous to 2013.</p><p id="Par102">Regarding BYM results, when compared to SMR maps, RR calculated by the BYM model has smoother patterns, both at municipality and parish scale, as to be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The smoothing effect is stronger in the parishes map. In fact, there are few parishes classified in the higher class in the BYM map.</p><p id="Par103">Similarly to what was described in SMR, CV values are higher at parish level. At mainland level, both municipalities and parishes register CV values indicating homogeneity of RR in the whole area. However, when we analyze CV values by each geographical unit, CV is higher than 20% in more than 70% of parishes.</p><p id="Par104">Based on these results, it seems that municipalities are more suitable than parishes to analyze mortality by all cancers in mainland Portugal. This statement can be also considered if we want to investigate specific types of cancer, for which the number of cases will be lower.</p><p id="Par105">In relation to applied methods, despite the smoothing effect, BYM results are according SMR and LISA maps. Particularly, we can highlight that the two areas classified in higher classes in the BYM municipalities map are also classified in this class in the SMR map.</p><p id="Par106">In short, considering the results obtained by all considered methods at the municipalities scale, we can affirm that high values of mortality by all cancer types tend to agglomerate in a belt from Lisbon to the southeast and in the Oporto area (coastal north). At the parishes scale, SMR and LISA results are not so clear, but BYM results support what was said previously.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par107">Our study is based on mortality data by cancer as a whole, which seems to be a good basis for an exploratory analysis of the effect of spatial aggregation of data in the geographical patterns of this disease. We used a mix of methodologies &#x02013; SMR rate, Moran&#x02019;s I and LISA, and BYM &#x02013; in order to understand the effect of spatial data aggregation in geographical patterns of cancer mortality in mainland Portugal.</p><p id="Par108">Our results show that BYM has the power of smoothing rates and minimizes the possible random variation of rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and simultaneously avoid the possible mask effect of inequalities, resulting from the adoption of large spatial scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In fact, our findings support that more spatial aggregated data leads to more reliable results but also contributes to a decrease of capacity to identify small (local) clusters, according to the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par109">There isn&#x02019;t a proper scale for mapping disease. The scale depends on the occurrence of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Based on our results, municipalities seem to be the best spatial level to answer the needs of power for cluster detection and reliability of estimated rates. Also, BYM seems to be more suitable than SMR to calculate and represent patterns of mortality by cancer in mainland Portugal.</p><p id="Par110">Independently of spatial aggregation of data, our findings show that mortality by malignant neoplasm in mainland Portugal forms clusters. Previous studies had already made reference to differences in the geographical distribution of cancer mortality in Portugal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This reinforces the necessity of continuing the studies in this area all the more because cancer and cardiovascular disease are responsible for more than 50% of the mortality burden in Portugal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We think our work, and future work in this area, is very important to obtain up-to-date and reliable information that supports programs in the field of fighting cancer and research.</p><p id="Par111">In summary, we think our work shows that the choice of spatial data aggregation has a high importance in research results, as different aggregation levels can lead to distinct results. Moreover, there is not a unique spatial aggregation or method suitable for one type of data or territory. So, in this type of research, it is very valuable to inspect different data aggregation levels and methods, in order to determine the most suitable for data under analysis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BYM</term><def><p id="Par9">Besag, York and Molli&#x000e9; model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAOP</term><def><p id="Par10">Official Administrative Map of Portugal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV</term><def><p id="Par11">Coefficient of variation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD-10</term><def><p id="Par12">10th revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LISA</term><def><p id="Par13">Local Moran&#x02019;s I</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Moran&#x02019;s I</term><def><p id="Par14">Global Moran&#x02019;s I</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NUTS III</term><def><p id="Par15">Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (level III)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p id="Par16">Posterior probability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p id="Par17">Relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMR</term><def><p id="Par18">Standardized mortality ratio</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Mafalda Sousa Uva (INSA) for the review of the manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par112">This research is self-financed.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par113">The data that support the findings of this study are available from Statistics Portugal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpgid=ine_main&#x00026;xpid=INE">https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpgid=ine_main&#x00026;xpid=INE</ext-link>) but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RR conceived the study, made acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data, and drafted the manuscript.
