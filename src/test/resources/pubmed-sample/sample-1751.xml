To carefully characterize the complete network of interactions involved and the binding affinities between their extracellular domains, an improved kinetic assay is needed to overcome limitations with surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Here, we present a magneto-nanosensor platform integrated with a microfluidic chip that allows measurement of dissociation constants in the micromolar-range. High-density conjugation of magnetic nanoparticles with prey proteins allows multivalent receptor interactions with sensor-immobilized bait proteins, more closely mimicking natural-receptor clustering on cells. The platform has advantages over traditional SPR in terms of insensitivity of signal responses to pH and salinity, less consumption of proteins and better sensitivities. Using this platform, we characterized the binding affinities of the PD-1&#x02014;PD-L1/PD-L2 co-inhibitory receptor system, and discovered an unexpected interaction between the two known PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

For example, leukocyte cell-surface receptors interact with tumour cells and tumour environment, and thus are attractive targets for immunotherapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Considerable efforts have been made to understand the interactions and their functions via these cell-surface molecules such as the T-cell receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and costimulatory receptor CD28 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Recently, among the cell-surface molecules, inhibitory receptors (also known as immune checkpoint receptors) have been extensively studied in cancer to enhance T-cell-mediated antitumour response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The best-studied inhibitory receptors, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, have even led to immunotherapies that have achieved US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and translation to the clinic.</p><p>In immune checkpoint therapy, where blocking inhibitory receptor&#x02013;ligand interactions enhances antitumour responses, a fundamental understanding of the interactions between inhibitory receptors and their ligands is crucial to elucidate the mechanism of action. Critical elements are the identification of all interacting partners and the measurement of binding affinities between their extracellular domains. A challenge, however, is that dissociation constants of known interactions between leukocyte cell-surface molecules, as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, can range from a few to several hundred micromolars (&#x003bc;M)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To measure such a low-affinity interaction with SPR, the current gold standard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, high concentrations of reagents are required up to a comparable level of its dissociation constant or even a few orders of magnitude higher, which in some cases may be impractical with regards to protein solubility and expense. To address these issues, magneto-nanosensors with better sensitivities have been developed to perform kinetic binding measurements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, due to binding signals being coupled with diffusion rates in a stationary solution, our prior work on magneto-nanosensors relied heavily on a two-compartment model to estimate kinetic parameters.</p><p>Here, we present a much-improved platform where magneto-nanosensors are integrated with microfluidic chips to measure the dissociation constants of low-affinity interactions in a multiplex manner by flowing protein-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) into microchannels over magneto-nanosensors coated with binding or non-binding partners. Conjugated MNPs at the surface are replenished by a continuous flow enabled by the microfluidic chips, reducing a previously-derived two-compartment binding model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> with a simple Langmuir isotherm. We then utilize this magneto-nanosensor platform to estimate the affinities of interactions between PD-1 (CD279), its ligands PD-L1 (B7-H1 or CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC or CD273), and B7-1 (CD80). Interestingly, the improved platform facilitates the discovery of a new interaction between PD-L1 and PD-L2, which we subsequently confirm using an unbiased cell-based, receptor-interaction screen.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Magneto-nanosensor platform and MNP tags</title><p>The magneto-nanosensor platform is based on a magneto-nanosensor chip integrated with a microfluidic chip to perform a kinetic assay with MNP complexes. A magneto-nanosensor chip is an array of magnetic sensors that can detect MNPs in their proximity, employing the effect of giant magnetoresistance (GMR). It has been mainly used to measure protein biomarkers in immunoassay formats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> after the advent of the initial concept<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. For kinetic assays with the magneto-nanosensors, proteins of interest (prey) need to be pre-conjugated with MNPs instead of being sequentially added as in the immunoassays. Upon binding of the prey-MNP complexes to the proteins on the sensors (bait), the magneto-nanosensors produce signals proportional to the number of bound complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. To conjugate MNPs with prey proteins, Fc-tagged proteins and MNPs coated with protein A from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were mixed to link them via the interaction between protein A and the Fc-region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). To saturate all protein A's on the surface of the MNP, a 1,000 times higher concentration of Fc-tagged proteins compared with the concentration of the MNPs was incubated with the MNPs. Unbound Fc-tagged proteins were washed away using magnetic columns that can retain the conjugated MNPs under an external magnetic field. The conjugated MNPs were eluted from the column after removing the magnetic field. Bait proteins, including both binding and non-binding partners, were immobilized on the sensors in duplicates and used to test interactions with prey proteins. Since the bait proteins that we used are also Fc-tagged, an additional blocking step with soluble protein A have been conducted before the complexes were flowed in to avoid any undesirable protein A-mediated bindings, as utilized previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. For immobilization of proteins on the sensors, proteins at 1&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were deposited to fully cover the surface, allowing bivalent interactions to take place with multiple prey proteins on the MNP. Due to flexibility of linkage and geometry, only a few prey proteins on the MNP are directly involved with the interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Furthermore, other studies showed that nanoparticles (with comparable size to ours) with multivalency (more than four) have a converged dissociation constant over various polyvalencies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and it has been suggested that the bivalent mode is predominant in the interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In our case, the MNPs have a capacity of conjugation with at least 150 prey proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). If we assumed either monovalent or trivalent mode of binding, the resulting kinetic calculations would have yielded substantial discrepancy in estimated dissociation constants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the bivalent mode is the main contribution of binding in these interactions. A four-channel microfluidic chip made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was aligned on the magneto-nanosensor chip with an 8 &#x000d7; 8 array of sensors to allocate 16 sensors per channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). For the experiments described in this paper, a multi-channel syringe pump was used to flow different types of solutions or serially diluted solutions containing MNPs into the channels individually. The immobilization pattern of bait proteins and the direction of flow were identical across the channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Measurement of real-time binding curves</title><p>To demonstrate the ability of our magneto-nanosensor platform to detect micromolar affinity interactions, human PD-1 and its ligands were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). After MNPs were conjugated with prey proteins (one of PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and B7-1), the complexes were eluted and serially diluted to be 100 (undiluted), 75, 50 and 25&#x00025;, respectively, of the eluted concentration. These four different concentrations of the same complexes were flowed through different channels, respectively, at 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;l&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Each channel had the same immobilization pattern of bait proteins on the sensors. PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and B7-1, which were used as prey proteins conjugated with MNPs (as just described), were also immobilized as bait proteins on the sensors, along with two negative controls such as murine IgG and bovine serum albumin (BSA).</p><p>When the complexes with PD-1 were flowed through the channels, the binding signals were observed only from both PD-L1 and PD-L2 immobilized sensors, which are known ligands of PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). PD-1 did not interact with other non-binding partners or itself, and the signals from them remained low and constant during the course of measurement. As the concentration decreased across channels (highest in channel 1 and lowest in channel 4), the binding rates were reduced. Similarly, when the complexes with PD-L1 were flowed over another chip, they bound to PD-1 and its recently discovered receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, B7-1, on the sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Surprisingly, a novel interaction between PD-L1 and PD-L2 was discovered. This interaction was again observed when PD-L2 complexes were flowed over PD-L1 immobilized sensors, switching the orientation of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the baseline signal of the magneto-nanosensor was not shifted, unlike SPR, when the samples were introduced at around 1&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). To further test the sensitivity of magneto-nanosensors to pH and salinity, different types of solutions containing the same amounts of both protein A-coated and streptavidin-coated MNPs were flowed into different channels where murine IgG isotypes, IgM, BSA and biotinylated BSA were immobilized, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Initially, all channels were filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4, and MNP solutions at the same or different pH and at a higher salt concentration were introduced. During the transient period, the signals from non-binding partners (negative controls: IgM and BSA) remained constant, which indicates that the magneto-nanosensor signals are insensitive to changes in pH. At pH 5.5, the interactions between protein A and all murine IgG isotypes except IgG2a were impaired, which is a well-known phenomenon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In contrast, the binding between biotin and streptavidin was stable within the pH range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In addition, salinity did not significantly affect the magneto-nanosensor signals from these interactions, and no stepwise change was generated in the signals when the high salt solution, SSC 2 &#x000d7; (saline sodium citrate 2 &#x000d7; : 0.3&#x02009;M NaCl), was introduced into the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Under similar conditions, baseline shifts or stepwise changes would be easily observed in SPR signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Importantly, when the same concentrations of protein A-coated MNPs were flowed into two identical channels where murine IgG isotypes were immobilized, the binding curves from the channels were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), attesting to the robustness of the magneto-nanosensor and the new developed kinetic assay protocol.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Calculation of kinetic parameters</title><p>Since the flow rate of the complexes was sufficiently fast to reach the reaction-limited regime (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), the binding kinetics can be expressed simply by the Langmuir isotherm as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1">equation (1)</xref>, and is mainly determined by the concentration of the complexes:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e387" xlink:href="ncomms12220-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>&#x003b8;</italic> is the coverage of bait proteins bound to the complexes, <italic>C</italic> is the concentration of the complexes in solution, <inline-formula id="d33e396"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e397" xlink:href="ncomms12220-m2.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="d33e399"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e400" xlink:href="ncomms12220-m3.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the association and dissociation rate of the bivalent interaction, respectively, and the dissociation constant of the bivalent interaction, <inline-formula id="d33e402"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e403" xlink:href="ncomms12220-m4.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

The binding curves of PD-L2 complexes to PD-L1 on the sensor surface showed a dose response, indicative of a true protein&#x02013;protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). One possibility for why this interaction has not been identified before is that the binding affinities might be exceptionally low. To evaluate this possibility, the kinetic parameters were calculated as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Interestingly, the dissociation constants of the monovalent interaction were calculated to be 10.7&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (PD-L1 flowed) and 9.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (PD-L2 flowed), showing that their affinities are not significantly lower than other interactions in this receptor-interaction network. In addition, the interaction appears to be human-specific, because the interaction between murine PD-L1 and PD-L2 was not detected using our platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the interaction was detectable using SPR, we conducted a series of Biacore binding experiments between PD-L1 and PD-L2, and controls from 0.5 to 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M analyte concentrations.

To compensate for low-affinity interactions, PD-L1 was screened both as an Fc-fusion and as a multimeric biotin&#x02013;streptavidin complex. Interestingly, the known interaction between PD-L1 and B7-1 showed a relatively low-signal response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This is consistent with our own observations that the PD-L1/B7-1 interaction is difficult to detect on the cell surface (unpublished results). In both datasets, however, there are clear hits against the two clones of PD-1 and a single clone of PD-L2 present in the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These results confirm the binding activity between PD-L1 and PD-L2 in the context of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The key aspect of the magneto-nanosensor platform is to utilize bivalent interactions, which enables the measurement of micromolar-ranged interactions with less reagent consumption. Combined with this, the multiplexing capabilities of the platform further reduced the total amount of reagents for multiple tests. Especially for screening low-affinity interactions, it is considerably expensive to supply the reagents required for the tests. Another important advantage of the multiplexing capability is that it enables high-throughput kinetic assays. This dose not only reduce the total assay time, but also allows highly precise comparison between multiple binding partners against the same prey protein because the binding partners on different sensors are exposed to exactly the same solution containing the prey proteins under the same condition. In other words, we can minimize the risks of experimental variations between multiple measurements with the identical condition performed separately. Integration with microfluidic chips simplifies the mathematical binding model described in the previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and compartmentalizes the sensors to perform multiple tests with different concentrations of prey proteins in parallel. Incorporated with the binding rate measurement, this allows removing the need for regeneration of the chip, which is inevitably performed in SPR to obtain a set of data with different concentrations of prey proteins. Thus, the efforts to find the optimal regeneration condition to retain activity of bait proteins over multiple cycles of tests with different concentrations of prey proteins are no longer needed in the magneto-nanosensor platform. In addition, SPR measures the changes in refractive index induced upon binding of prey proteins in solution to bait proteins immobilized on the surface. The refractive index, however, is also affected by changes in pH or salt concentration of the solution, which inevitably results from switching solutions between samples and buffers. These unpredictable and undesirable changes in signal introduce additional complexity into the analysis. Insensitivity of our platform to pH and salinity removes the need for a complicated algorithm to decouple pure binding signals from obtained sensor signals. This feature also provides the ability to study the dependency of protein&#x02013;protein interactions on pH or salinity, which was clearly demonstrated in this paper.</p><p>Our new platform for kinetic assays can be readily scaled up. The number of data points obtained with a single magneto-nanosensor chip is currently limited by the number of sensors and microfluidic channels per chip. Since the magneto-nanosensor chips are easily scalable (for example, from 64 sensors up to 256 sensors) with minimal loss in performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, a quadruple number of data points can be obtained at a time to reduce measurement variations and fitting errors compared with the current setting. Alternatively, more prey proteins, bait proteins or binding conditions can be interrogated in a single 256-sensor chip. To accommodate even more advanced kinetic studies, we have found a path forward for realizing magneto-nanosensor chips with thousands of sensors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p><p>The novel interaction between PD-L1 and PD-L2 was detected with two independent modalities: magneto-nanosensor platforms and cell-based expression-cloning screens. This interaction, however, was not observed with SPR, which may be a reason that it has not been discovered until now. It is possible that immobilization of bait proteins on the SPR sensor surface masks the PD-L1/PD-L2 binding epitope, but not PD-1 or B7-1 binding surface. The different sensor surface used here may allow access to a fraction of the immobilized molecules on the magneto-nanosensor.</p><p>Although the functional implications of the novel interaction between PD-L1 and PD-L2 in immune response and cancer checkpoint activity remain to be determined, both of these PD-1 ligands can in some circumstances be co-expressed by tumour cells, as exemplified by expression studies on Reed&#x02013;Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In this disease, both PD-L1 and PD-L2 are common targets of chromosome 9p24.1 amplification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. It will be important to determine if the PD-L1/PD-L2 ligands are capable of interacting in <italic>cis</italic>- (on the same cell surface) or <italic>trans</italic>-orientations (between cells). Our binding experiments, using GMR and expression cloning, do not necessarily define the orientation of the potentially physiological interaction. In addition, understanding this interaction is competitive or synergistic with regards to PD-1 binding and functional stimulation will be critical for biological understanding. The novel interaction of PD-L1 and PD-L2 warrants further investigations, which could enrich our understanding of the PD-1&#x02014;PD-L1/PD-L2 inhibitory checkpoint pathway, and may provide new avenues for developing immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Magneto-nanosensor chip</title><p>The magneto-nanosensor chip has a dimension of 10 &#x000d7; 12&#x02009;mm and an 8 &#x000d7; 8 array of sensors on the chip.
