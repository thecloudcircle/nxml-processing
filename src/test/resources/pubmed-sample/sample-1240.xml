Traditional tethered recording systems restrict movement and limit the environments suitable for testing, while existing wireless technology is still too heavy for extended recording in mice. Here we tested TaiNi, a novel ultra-lightweight (&#x0003c;2&#x02009;g) low power wireless system allowing 72-hours of recording from 16 channels sampled at ~19.5 KHz (9.7 KHz bandwidth). We captured local field potentials and action-potentials while mice engaged in unrestricted behaviour in a variety of environments and while performing tasks. Data was synchronized to behaviour with sub-second precision. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art wireless system demonstrated a significant improvement in behaviour owing to reduced weight. Parallel recordings with a tethered system revealed similar spike detection and clustering. TaiNi represents a significant advance in both animal welfare in electrophysiological experiments, and the scope for continuously recording large amounts of data from small animals.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recent advances in the development of transgenic mice have provided unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of mammalian brain function and human disease processes, and have led to a dramatic shift from rats to mice as the preferred preclinical model used in drug discovery. However, their small size makes neuronal recording in freely-moving mice challenging. The ability to make direct electrophysiological recordings from populations of neurons requires multiple parallel recording channels and high sampling rates (&#x0003e;10&#x02009;KHz) in order to properly characterize action potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The circuitry required is consequently energy-intensive and traditionally requires a multi-wire tether to provide power and to carry the analogue signal to the recording equipment. While this is practical in larger rodents, it presents a serious burden for a mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recently developed wireless recording systems allow both greater freedom of movement and the possibility of entirely new experimental designs, such as recording from complex enclosed environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, there has always been a trade-off between the weight of the device and recording density or duration. Current off-the-shelf solutions are limited to less than 4&#x02009;hours recording unless a harness is employed to support the additional battery weight, or provide longer recording only at reduced sample-rates which are suitable for recording local field potentials (LFP) or electroencephalograms (EEG), but not action potentials (APs). In either case, the devices are also still cumbersome and relatively heavy (4&#x02009;g or more, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This represents &#x0003e;10% of the weight of an adult mouse - similar to a human subject carrying a 6&#x02009;Kg weight on their head. To improve on existing wireless technology, the circuitry needed to be redesigned from the bottom-up, with an emphasis on improving the energy efficiency.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>A comparison of telemetry systems for electrophysiology.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>System</th><th>Weight (g)</th><th>Time (hours)</th><th>Channels</th><th>Sample-rate (Hz)</th><th>Band-width (Hz)</th><th>Bit-depth</th><th>Noise (rms)</th><th>Input Voltage Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TaiNi</td><td>1.5</td><td>72</td><td>16</td><td>19531</td><td>0.35&#x02013;9700</td><td>12</td><td>3.9&#x02009;&#x000b5;V</td><td>13&#x02009;mVp-p</td></tr><tr><td>Millar MT10B<sup>a</sup>

The TaiNi device was positioned on the bench, with the loop of the transmitting antenna directed towards the receiving antenna. The horizontal distance between the two antennas was increased in 10&#x02009;cm increments between 0.1 and 3.0&#x02009;m.

Here, mice were singly housed on a 12&#x02009;hour light/dark cycle with water provided ad libitum. Food was restricted as required prior to behavioural testing, with mice maintained at no less than 85% of their free-feeding weight. Because the mice used had previously participated in another experiment, 9 of them were treated from 2&#x02013;3 months of age with doxycycline (DOX), initially via a daily bolus of 10&#x02009;mg/kg p.o. doxycycline hyclate (Sigma Aldrich, GB) for the first two days. They were then maintained on doxycycline-mixed chow diet (Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet, 200&#x02009;mg DOX per kg of dietary chow) until the end of the study. All tests involving a comparison of different systems required all animals to run in all conditions, so the DOX treatment could not affect the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Surgery</title><p id="Par8">Mice were implanted with either a single shank 16 channel probe attached to a microdrive (Cambridge Neurotech, GB) targeting the CA1 region of the hippocampus (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14 mice; AP: +1.7&#x02009;mm, ML: &#x02212;0.3&#x02009;mm relative to Bregma), or a static dual shank silicon probe (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 mice; 8 sites per shank (Neuronexus, USA)) targeting the medial prefrontal cortex (AP: +1.7&#x02009;mm, ML: &#x02212;0.3&#x02009;mm relative to Bregma &#x00026; DV: &#x02212;2.0&#x02009;mm from brain surface) &#x00026; dorsal hippocampus (AP: &#x02212;1.9&#x02009;mm, ML: &#x02212;2.0&#x02009;mm relative to Bregma &#x00026; DV: &#x02212;2.0&#x02009;mm from brain surface).</p><p id="Par9">Mice were initially anaesthetised with 3% isoflurane, before being transferred to a stereotaxic frame and maintained for the remainder of the procedure at 1.5&#x02013;2%. Five stainless steel screws (00&#x02013;96&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1/16, PlasticsOne, USA) were attached to the skull and used as an anchor point for implant. One of the screws was placed over the cerebellum and acted as the ground electrode. Craniotomies were made at the specified stereotaxic coordinates, and the probe lowered into position before the hole was sealed with silicone sealant (3&#x02013;4680 silicone gel kit, Dow Corning, USA). Light curable composite (Revolution Formula 2, Kerr Dental, USA) was used to bind the implant/microdrive to the skull. Mice were allowed to recover for a minimum of 2 weeks before entering into any experiments, however probes attached to microdrives were slowly lowered to span the CA1 pyramidal layer over multiple days between 1 &#x00026; 2 weeks post-surgery (initially implanted 500&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below the brain surface).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Room and system configuration</title><p id="Par10">All <italic>in vivo</italic> tests were conducted in a 3.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4.0&#x02009;m windowless room with black walls and ceiling, lit by two uplighters and separated by a door from an anteroom containing the recording equipment. The room was on a 12-12 dark-light cycle with lights-on at 7am, and all experiments except the 72-hour recording were conducted in the light portion of the cycle. The room contained four bespoke infrared tables (100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;cm), two on either side of the room and separated by 90&#x02009;cm. A near- infrared emitter array (4 x IR emitters, ~650&#x02009;nmm wavelength) and a miniature infrared-sensitive video camera (model M700LD, Henrys, UK) were centrally positioned above each table. The tables and emitter provided illumination of the subject from above and below to facilitate high-quality video tracking under a variety of lighting conditions.</p><p id="Par11">To receive the signals from the TaiNi transmitter, each table was equipped with a pair of omnidirectional rod-antennas (CSL 12dBi, 2.4&#x02009;GHz) elevated 30&#x02009;cm above the table, oriented horizontally and at 90-degrees to one another, forming an open bracket around the recording environments described below. The two antennas from each of the two tables on either side of the room were connected to a 4-way splitter (model DBD-PD-8426-4, dBD Communications UK) by 1.5&#x02009;m lengths of flexible antenna cable (LBC195 ExtraFlex, MS Distribution UK). Each splitter was in turn connected to one of two inputs on the receiver in the anteroom via 12&#x02009;m lengths of heavy-gauge coaxial cable (LBC 400, MS Distribution UK). This heavy cable has very low 0.2&#x02009;dB/m signal-attenuation.</p><p id="Par12">In the anteroom, video signals from all four cameras were fed to a quad video combiner (VQM801P, Sanyo, JPN) and the merged video stream processed by EthoVision XT 8.5 (Noldus, NL), enabling the position of each mouse (body-centre and nose) to be tracked. To allow synchronization of the electrophysiology and behavioural data, an I/O interface (PTIO-0020, Noldus, NL) was used to generate a signal at the beginning and end of each video tracking recording, which was converted to a TTL pulse by a hardware interface (MED-PC model SG-233-48) and was recorded by the Taini acquisition PC. The synchronization was performed on the receiving unit during the data post-processing using the local timings of the TTL pulse recorded in both the electrophysiology and behavioural data. The antenna signals were fed to the same model and configuration receiver used in the bench tests (see above). Acquired signals were passed via a 10 gigabit ethernet cable to a Linux workstation running custom software for channelization, demultiplexing, visualization and storage. Channelization was parallelized using the graphics processing unit (Quadro K420, Nvidia) to handle the large data bandwidth. The software also registered TTL sync-pulses sent by the EthoVision PC.</p><p id="Par13">All 16 channels from each transmitter were recorded &#x0201c;single-ended&#x0201d; (non-differential), using only the cerebellar skull screw as the signal ground.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Training and testing</title><p id="Par14">During the 72&#x02009;hour recordings, mice (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) with dual shank probes were placed in a novel home-cage (15&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;30&#x02009;cm) with free access to food and water for the duration of the recording. Open field pellet-chasing experiments were performed using 4 food restricted, five month old female rTg4510 mice (2 nonDOX &#x00026; 2 DOX treated) implanted with single shank silicon probes. These mice were trained twice daily on a pellet chasing task (10&#x02009;minutes per session) for a total of 10 days in the month proceeding testing. Training consisted of mice being placed in a transparent, circular arena (diameter: 30&#x02009;cm; height: 50&#x02009;cm) with pellets (12&#x02009;mg chocolate flavour AIN-76A Rodent Tablet, TestDiet, USA) dispensed from above at 20&#x02009;s intervals. On the day of recording, a 60&#x02009;min sleep recording was performed in a familiar home-cage environment before the mice were transferred to the familiar open field arena for 20&#x02009;mins of pellet chasing (20&#x02009;s inter-pellet interval).</p><p id="Par15">Throughout both the 72&#x02009;hour and open field recordings, the cameras above each mouse continually captured data. In the open field recordings the animal&#x02019;s body was tracked as a silhouette against the infrared emitting table under the arena, while during the home-cage recordings the overhead infrared emitters provided the necessary contrast against the bedding material, which obscured the light from the table below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Split signal tests</title><p id="Par16">Concurrent home-cage recordings (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 mice implanted with single shank probes in CA1) were performed using the TaiNi and tethered Digital Lynx SX (Software: Cheetah v5.6.0, Neuralynx, USA) recording systems by utilising a signal splitter placed inline between the silicon probe and headstages.

The centre-arm of the maze was 100&#x02009;cm in length and each of the reward arms 36&#x02009;cm long. The maze was raised 100&#x02009;cm from the ground and sited in a rectangular room containing multiple visual cues. 3 pellet dispensers were situated around the maze (one per reward arm &#x00026; one in the delay area at the beginning of the centre arm) to allow rewards (12&#x02009;mg unflavoured AIN-76A Rodent Tablet, TestDiet, USA) to be delivered for successful performance.</p><p id="Par19">The maze protocol was automatically controlled by a microcontroller board (Arduino Mega 2560) connected via a USB serial connection to a host-PC running Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The animals&#x02019; position was detected by infrared beam breaks, which enabled the maze controller to adjust the position of 5 pneumatically driven, black Perspex doors. These could be to be raised from below to block entry into areas of the maze as appropriate.</p><p id="Par20">The T-maze task comprised of a sample and choice component. In the initial forced phase, mice were guided along the centre arm by the doors and forced to turn left/right in a pseudo-random manner (maximum of 3 consecutive sample runs to the same arm) in order to receive a reward. Mice then returned to the holding area in return for a second reward, at which time the choice phase of the task began. Mice were again guided along the central arm of the maze, before being offered a free choice to enter either reward arm. Mice were given a reward only if they chose to enter the opposite arm visited during the sample phase. A further reward was provided at the waiting area for mice making a correct choice. Mice were held in this zone for 5&#x02009;s prior to be start of the next trial.

TaiNi tends to detect somewhat fewer spikes overall, and both systems sometimes identify clusters not found by the other.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">Our tests confirm that the TaiNi wireless system is lighter than any commercially available wireless device able to record neuronal action potentials, and indeed lighter even than multi-channel devices capable only of recording LFPs. The light weight resulted in significant improvements in the ability to complete trials on the T-maze task compared to the most similar commercially available alternative, the TBSI transmitter. While our relatively unimpaired animals showed no concomitant reduction in the percentage of correct choices on the T-maze task, the ability to complete additional trials increases statistical power and reduces the number of animals required for a given experiment. This provides an animal welfare benefit beyond the obvious ones for the individual animal wearing the transmitter.</p><p id="Par40">TaiNi was capable of undisturbed recordings spanning multiple diurnal cycles. This is particularly important for studies using mice, for which human contact has a prolonged effect on behaviour, and which often have (as we observed) erratic sleep patterns. Consequently the TaiNi transmitter both removes the stress associated with repeated handling to change batteries or untwist tethers, and also enables state-dependent analyses of neuronal activity which are traditionally very challenging in mice. Long-duration recording also enables the discovery of novel phenomena such as the discrete categories of 140&#x02013;220&#x02009;Hz ripple-oscillations revealed by the current experiments. This might not have been possible without many hours of recordings integrated across fluctuating behavioural states. While we were unable to process the enormous volume of 72-hour action potential data at the time of writing, the potential to do so in the near future opens up many novel avenues of scientific investigation. It is also worth noting that while our tests ran to 72&#x02009;hours using a 180&#x02009;mAh battery, using a 310&#x02009;mAh better would extend recording to 120&#x02009;hours (5 days) while adding only 0.25&#x02009;g to the total weight.</p><p id="Par41">We also confirm that the acquisition system is capable of simultaneously acquiring 16 channels of 19.5&#x02009;KHz data streams from four devices using a single receiver, and accurately synchronising the data with movement and position information recorded by the Ethovision whole-body tracking software. This demonstrates the scalability of the system given additional receivers, and the time-stamp integrity required for analyses such as the spatial selectivity of hippocampal neurons and the instantaneous behavioural correlates of local field potential oscillations. Both benefits are important in industry-scale experimental programs where recording from many animals simultaneously is a benefit, and integration of multiple data streams is essential.</p><p id="Par42">Finally, split-signal recordings confirm that, for LFP recordings, the results from TaiNi are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those obtained using a higher-power, higher bit-rate tethered system. As expected, there is some compromise in terms of detection of very low amplitude events, which manifests as slightly different spike clustering results and somewhat lower action-potential counts in each cluster. However, we believe this is typical of any 12-bit wireless recording system, and does not represent an obstacle to collecting high-quality data.</p><p id="Par43">In summary, we believe the TaiNi wireless transmitter is a transformative technology which opens up entirely new areas of investigation using long-duration, high-density recordings in mice. The experiments described here illustrate, for the first time, the capabilities of this device in a real-world experimental setting, and reveal a feature of high-frequency neuronal oscillations which might otherwise have been impossible to observe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
