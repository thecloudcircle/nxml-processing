However, most algae produce neutral lipids only under stress conditions. Here, we report that treatment with Brefeldin A (BFA), a chemical inducer of ER stress, rapidly triggers lipid droplet (LD) formation in two different microalgal species, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Chlorella vulgaris.</italic> LD staining using Nile red revealed that BFA-treated algal cells exhibited many more fluorescent bodies than control cells. Lipid analyses based on thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography revealed that the additional lipids formed upon BFA treatment were mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs). The increase in TAG accumulation was accompanied by a decrease in the betaine lipid diacylglyceryl <italic>N,N,N</italic>-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS), a major component of the extraplastidic membrane lipids in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, suggesting that at least some of the TAGs were assembled from the degradation products of membrane lipids. Interestingly, BFA induced TAG accumulation in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells regardless of the presence or absence of an acetate or nitrogen source in the medium. This effect of BFA in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells seems to be due to BFA-induced ER stress, as supported by the induction of three homologs of ER stress marker genes by the drug. Together, these results suggest that ER stress rapidly triggers TAG accumulation in two green microalgae, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>C. vulgaris.</italic> A further investigation of the link between ER stress and TAG synthesis may yield an efficient means of producing biofuel from algae.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the Global Frontier Program (2011-0031345) of the Republic of Korea awarded to YL and HO, from Gyeongbuk Sea Grant Program funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea, from a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (21570034) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan awarded to IN, and from the French ANR (DIESALG) awarded to YL-B.

To retain food sources for an ever-increasing population, it is imperative that new feedstocks for biofuel be identified that can replace fossil fuel <xref rid="pone.0081978-Schubert1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Many microalgae grow rapidly and produce a large amount of biomass, and under certain cultivation conditions, can also store large amounts of oil that can readily be converted into biodiesel <xref rid="pone.0081978-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Microalgae have thus been suggested as an alternative source for green renewable energy production <xref rid="pone.0081978-Wijffels1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is a model organism for studying many biological processes, including photosynthesis and flagella function <xref rid="pone.0081978-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. More recently, it was also used to study microalgal lipid metabolism. This photosynthetic green alga uses sunlight and CO<sub>2</sub> to produce chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates and lipids, and requires nitrogen to synthesize the proteins necessary for cell growth <xref rid="pone.0081978-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Under stress conditions (notably nitrogen depletion), <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> starts to accumulate significant amounts of neutral lipids (mainly triacylglycerols, TAGs) in distinct cellular organelles called lipid droplets (LDs) <xref rid="pone.0081978-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081978-Siaut1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The fatty acids required for TAG assembly are either synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> or produced from recycled acyl chains from membrane lipids <xref rid="pone.0081978-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081978-Siaut1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Under culture conditions widely used in laboratories, exogenously supplied acetate boosts TAG production <italic>via</italic> the <italic>de novo</italic> pathway. The exact contribution of each pathway to TAG synthesis under specific conditions remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Among the many stress conditions, nitrogen starvation is the most effective means of triggering oil accumulation in algae <xref rid="pone.0081978-Siaut1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, this approach is not ideal because <italic>i)</italic> nitrogen depletion reduces photosynthesis and thus the overall production of biomass and <italic>ii)</italic> at the industrial level, nitrogen removal is energy intensive, time-consuming, and costly <xref rid="pone.0081978-MolinaGrima1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, it would be beneficial to identify methods of inducing oil accumulation in cells that do not involve nitrogen starvation and that can be used to culture many different algae <xref rid="pone.0081978-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Brefeldin A (BFA) is a drug well-known for its inhibitory effect on vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, which causes retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the ER <xref rid="pone.0081978-LippincottSchwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. BFA thus disrupts trafficking of newly synthesized and modified proteins and membrane lipids (mainly phospholipids and sterols) to their final destinations, causing unfolded protein accumulation and lipid composition changes <xref rid="pone.0081978-Mrigout1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081978-Fei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, all of which are symptoms of ER stress. Notably, the ER stress induced by BFA treatment induces neutral lipid accumulation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, with corresponding increases in the number of cellular LDs <xref rid="pone.0081978-Fei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081978-Harris2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. ER stress can be detected in organisms by monitoring the expression levels of ER stress marker genes, including BiP (lumenal binding protein) and SAR1 (secretion associated membrane protein 1).</p><p>Here, we report that BFA treatment rapidly induces LD formation in two species of microalgae, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Chlorella vulgaris,</italic> and that the lipids induced by BFA treatment are mainly TAGs. Our chemical analysis of lipids suggests that this neutral lipid accumulation is due to perturbation of lipid homeostasis at the ER and other extra-plastidial membranes. In support of this explanation, BFA induces the expression of several ER stress marker gene homologs in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, suggesting that ER stress causes TAG accumulation. Interestingly, the lipid induction by BFA is very fast, and occurs regardless of whether or not nitrogen or acetate is present in the medium, suggesting that the drug induces LD accumulation <italic>via</italic> a pathway independent of that triggered by nutrient starvation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>The <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> strains <italic>CC-503</italic> wild type <italic>mt+</italic> (<italic>cw92</italic>) and <italic>CC-125</italic> wild type <italic>mt+</italic> (<italic>137c</italic>) were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (USA). <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains were cultured in Tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium <xref rid="pone.0081978-Harris2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> at 25&#x000b0;C under continuous light with shaking. <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> cells were obtained from the Biological Resource Center (BRC, Korea) and cultured in BG11 medium <xref rid="pone.0081978-Rippka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> under the same conditions as used for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>LD Induction by BFA Treatment</title><p>Brefeldin A (LC Labs) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 50 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until use.

</title><p>In an effort to identify alternative methods of triggering oil accumulation in green microalgae, we evaluated the effects of a well-known vesicle trafficking inhibitor, brefeldin A (BFA), on lipid droplet (LD) formation in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. As an initial test, we incubated a culture of cell wall-less <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strain <italic>CC-503</italic> in TAP medium until the mid-log phase (approximately 5.0&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and then treated the cells with BFA for 4 h at a final concentration of 75 &#x000b5;g mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. We monitored the occurrence of LDs in BFA-treated cells by staining the samples with a fluorescent indicator dye for lipid bodies, Nile red, and then monitoring them by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>Whereas numerous fluorescent LDs were observed in BFA-treated cells, none or only a few were present in control cells (treated only with DMSO, the solvent used for dissolving BFA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). LDs were highly fluorescent under either the TRITC or FITC filter set, but they were more clearly distinguishable from the large chloroplast when the FITC filter set was used. Time dependency tests using a TECAN fluorescence spectrophotometer revealed that, in normal TAP medium supplemented with nitrogen (+N) and acetate (+Ac), the addition of BFA rapidly (within 2 h) induced the formation of LDs, as gauged by an increase in Nile red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

This BFA effect was observed regardless of whether an acetate or nitrogen source was present in the medium or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>BFA commonly induces ER stress in many different organisms.

Supporting this possibility, DTT, a drug known to induce ER stress in many different organisms <xref rid="pone.0081978-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081978-Okamura1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081978-Bertolotti1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, also induced the expression of the three genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). BFA treatment inhibits membrane trafficking from the ER to Golgi membranes, thereby promoting retrograde vesicle transport from Golgi membranes to the ER. This situation might provide ample substrates for the assembly of TAGs, causing LD accumulation in BFA-treated cells. In accordance with this hypothesis, the concentration of DGTS, a lipid synthesized and exported from the ER, was decreased upon BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Thus, we suggest that DGTS, which is retrieved from other membranes into the ER, is recycled and provides the fatty acid source for the assembly of TAGs in BFA-treated cells. This explanation is further supported by the high level of 18&#x02236;3(5,9,12) in the TAGs of BFA-treated cells compared to those of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The 18&#x02236;3(5,9,12) fatty acid is the major fatty acid present in DGTS, and is rarely found in chloroplastic lipids <xref rid="pone.0081978-Giroud1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the increase in TAG levels is much smaller than the decrease in DGTS, and the content of several other lipids was also altered. Thus, BFA seems to cause a serious perturbation in lipid homeostasis, and a part of the degradation product of membrane lipids is converted into TAGs. To accurately determine the sources of fatty acids for BFA-induced TAG synthesis, pulse-chase experiments should be conducted in the future.</p><p>To perceive and overcome the ER stress, animal cells invoke pathways that increase the protein folding capacity, decrease the protein production at the ER, and promote lipogenesis <xref rid="pone.0081978-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081978-Martnez1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Similar ER stress responses are observed in some plant cells. ER stress activates many lipid metabolic enzymes in maize and soybean cells, and increases TAG accumulation in maize endosperm <xref rid="pone.0081978-Shank1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our experiments revealed BFA-induced TAG synthesis in two species of green algae, suggesting that similar alterations in lipid metabolism occur in response to ER stress in green algae. Consistent with this possibility, a homolog of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a protein kinase/ribonuclease with a central role in the ER stress response, exists in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genome (g8693 in Phytozome v9.1 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net">www.phytozome.net</ext-link>).

It was recently suggested that LDs might serve a protective function for immature proteins upon ER stress <xref rid="pone.0081978-Welte1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

This may be because the ER stress responses vary depending on the growth stage of the cell culture, and cells in young culture might respond more vigorously to ER stress than those in older ones.</p><p>BFA-induced TAG accumulation was observed before much alteration in chlorophyll content occurred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081978.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), indicating that BFA affects lipid accumulation without greatly influencing the chloroplast. Thus, the BFA-induced pathway is, at least in part, different from nitrogen starvation-induced LD formation, which involves degradation of chloroplastic membranes <xref rid="pone.0081978-Siaut1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Even under acetate-depleted conditions, BFA induced LD formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This is not surprising if the sources of the acyl-CoA pool used for TAG synthesis are pre-existing ER or other membrane lipids. Indeed, the concentration of DGTS, a lipid derived and trafficked from the ER of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, decreased upon BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), supporting our explanation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that newly synthesized acyl-CoAs, which use acetate in the medium as substrate, are also used for BFA-induced LD formation, since the effect of BFA was enhanced when acetate was added to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Thus, the acyl-CoA pool used for BFA-induced TAG synthesis seems to be made not only from recycled DGTS, but also from fatty acids synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> from acetate.</p><p>Surprisingly, even under nitrogen depletion, when cells already accumulate LDs, BFA further increases TAG content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g004">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). In cells starved of nitrogen and then treated with BFA, a large proportion of TAGs would already have been synthesized in chloroplasts, but a small portion of TAGs, in addition, might have been synthesized at the ER upon BFA treatment. Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis increases <xref rid="pone.0081978-Moellering1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081978-Siaut1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, newly synthesized fatty acids, rather than recycled fatty acids, may be the major substrate of BFA-induced TAG formation under nitrogen-deficient conditions. In accordance with this explanation, the fatty acid composition of TAGs was not different between BFA-treated and control cells under nitrogen starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This was in contrast to the fatty acid composition of TAGs under nitrogen-sufficient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), indicating that different sources of acyl-CoAs are used for most of the TAG synthesis under nitrogen-deficient and nitrogen-sufficient conditions.</p><p>Previous approaches to increase TAG content in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> focused on increasing the activity of enzymes involved in TAG biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0081978-LaRussa1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, or disrupting starch synthesis <xref rid="pone.0081978-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, both strategies depend on nitrogen starvation or other stress conditions that require long-term treatment and are expensive. Here, we demonstrated that BFA rapidly induces LD formation in two microalgal species, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Chlorella.</italic> It is particularly interesting that the drug was effective regardless of whether or not an exogenous acetate or nitrogen source was present in the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081978-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Therefore, the drug can be used to convert membrane lipids into TAGs after harvest of biomass grown under optimal conditions. This is valuable, since neutral lipids such as TAGs are much easier to convert into fuel than membrane lipids. However, the problem in this scheme is that the drug is non-specific and has pleiotropic effects, including protein degradation and, in the case of prolonged treatment, cell death. Thus, it is necessary to pinpoint specifically which aspect of the BFA response alters the lipid content and to use this knowledge to reduce the amount of time needed to produce LDs and increase the portion of neutral lipids harvestable from the algae. Further studies of the detailed mechanisms by which BFA affects lipid metabolism may provide a clue for developing an efficient strategy for microalgae&#x02013;based biofuel production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0081978.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
