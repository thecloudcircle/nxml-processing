Green turtles (<italic>Chelonia mydas</italic>) are marine megaherbivores that consume seagrass throughout much of their global range. With successful conservation efforts, turtle abundance will increase, leading to more meadows being returned to their natural grazed state. There is concern this may lead to a loss of carbon stored in these systems, but the effects of green turtle grazing on seagrass ecosystem carbon dynamics have not been investigated. Here we experimentally show that despite 79% lower net ecosystem production (NEP) following grazing (24.7 vs. 119.5&#x02009;mmol&#x02009;C m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in a Caribbean <italic>Thalassia testudinum</italic> seagrass meadow, grazed areas maintained net positive metabolic carbon uptake. Additionally, grazing did not change the meadow production to respiration ratio, indicating it did not stimulate remineralization of sediment carbon stores. Compared to other published estimates of seagrass NEP (median: 20.6&#x02009;mmol&#x02009;C m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), NEP in grazed Caribbean <italic>T. testudinum</italic> meadows is similar to that in many other ungrazed systems. Our results demonstrate that while grazing does decrease potential future carbon sequestration as a result of lower NEP, it does not promote a metabolic release of current carbon stocks.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Seagrass meadows form some of the most productive ecosystems in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

</p><p id="Par4">Supporting abundant green turtle populations and sustaining a carbon sink are both important conservation aims for global seagrass ecosystems. Grazed meadows with intact grazer populations is the natural state of seagrass ecosystems. Historically, when green turtle abundance was much higher than today<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, Caribbean seagrass meadows supported extensive grazing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, with the majority of meadows likely in a grazed state before humans disrupted these coevolved systems through overexploitation of green turtles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. While green turtle grazing helps maintain meadow health by removing older, pathogen-susceptible seagrass blades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, grazing also reduces the size of the photosynthetic seagrass canopy that is capable of allocating production belowground for storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It has been hypothesized that grazing may have negative effects on seagrass meadow carbon sequestration and storage, and that the conservation of both green turtles and seagrass carbon stores are incompatible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To better conserve these ecosystems, it is necessary to understand how ecosystem processes, such as carbon sequestration, operate within seagrass meadows in their naturally grazed state. We hypothesized that: (1) metabolic carbon uptake rates (net ecosystem production) would be lower in grazed compared to ungrazed areas as a result of reduced aboveground biomass, and (2) carbon remineralization rates (ecosystem respiration) would be proportionally higher in grazed than in ungrazed areas as a result of increased heterotrophic respiration due to aeration of surface sediments following removal of the seagrass canopy.</p><p id="Par6">We conducted an experimental manipulation in Little Cayman, Cayman Islands, by clipping seagrass (<italic>Thalassia testudinum</italic>) to simulate green turtle grazing. We measured areal rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R<sub>E</sub>), and net ecosystem production (NEP&#x02009;=&#x02009;GPP&#x02013;R<sub>E</sub>) weekly with benthic incubation chambers in five experimentally clipped plots and five unclipped reference plots to investigate changes in carbon dynamics following the onset of simulated grazing. Metabolism (GPP, R<sub>E</sub>, NEP) was similarly measured in nearby areas that were naturally, actively grazed for at least a year by juvenile green turtles and adjacent ungrazed areas, and these results were compared to those from the experimental and reference plots. To evaluate our measured rates and the effects of green turtle grazing in a broader geographical context, we also compiled published estimates of seagrass ecosystem metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effect of Grazing on Seagrass Ecosystem Metabolism</title><p id="Par7">Ecosystem metabolism (GPP, R<sub>E</sub>, NEP) was significantly lower in experimentally clipped plots compared to reference plots (mixed effects model; GPP, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;83, F<sub>1,8</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;106.4, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001; R<sub>E</sub>, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;83, F<sub>1,8</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;75.3, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001; NEP, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;83, F<sub>1,8</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34.8, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0004; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

</p><p id="Par8">We measured ecosystem metabolism using the same methods in naturally grazed areas and adjacent ungrazed areas of seagrass located near our experimental plots. These naturally grazed areas were actively maintained by juvenile green turtles and had been grazed continuously for at least one year. Net ecosystem production in naturally grazed areas was 92% lower than adjacent ungrazed areas on average, and we compared results from these naturally grazed areas, representing long-term effects of grazing, to those from our experimentally clipped plots, representing short-term effects of grazing. Metabolic rates in the naturally grazed areas were similar to those in our clipped plots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Though green turtle grazing removes much of the aboveground seagrass biomass, the belowground biomass is normally left intact in <italic>T. testudinum</italic> meadows (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Production may still be allocated to belowground tissues for long-term storage, thus allowing the meadow to remain a metabolic carbon sink in the presence of green turtle grazing. An example in Indonesia is an exception to this, in which green turtles became hyper-abundant (20 individuals ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) within a marine protected area and began digging and consuming belowground seagrass tissues (<italic>Halodule uninervis</italic>) when aboveground biomass alone was not enough to sustain the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The turtles may have been able to uproot and consume <italic>H. uninervis</italic> due to its shallow rhizosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> as compared to other seagrasses such as <italic>T. testudinum</italic> that form stronger and denser rhizome mats. To our knowledge, this behavior has not been observed elsewhere. In addition, green turtles often do not graze an entire meadow, but rather discrete patches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Though NEP was 92% lower in areas that had been grazed long-term by turtles, the reduction in whole-meadow NEP would be less than this, as NEP in ungrazed areas remained unaffected. Changes in the strength of the ecosystem metabolic carbon sink from grazing are therefore dependent upon the proportion of grazed to ungrazed areas within the meadow.</p><p id="Par13">The strong relationship between metabolic variables (GPP, R<sub>E</sub>, NEP) and aboveground seagrass biomass indicates that metabolic carbon dynamics in this system were largely driven by the seagrass rather than other potential producers such as epiphytes or microphytobenthos. This relationship also demonstrates that under a sustained green turtle grazing regime, rates of metabolic carbon uptake will remain lower than ungrazed areas. If turtles abandon or are excluded from an area, rates of carbon uptake will increase concomitantly with seagrass regrowth. This is further evidenced by fluctuations in NEP in our experimentally clipped plots. NEP was lower (15.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.2&#x02009;mmol&#x02009;C m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) when measured 2&#x02013;3 days after plots were clipped and aboveground biomass was low (10.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8&#x02009;g DM m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; even-numbered weeks; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), and higher (57.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;19.9&#x02009;mmol&#x02009;C m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) when measured 8&#x02013;10 days post-clipping and biomass had increased (33.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.9&#x02009;g DM m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; odd-numbered weeks).</p><p id="Par14">Our results show that meadows grazed by green turtles can maintain net positive metabolic carbon uptake, but there is concern as to what effect recovering green turtle populations&#x02014;and increased grazing&#x02014;will have on current seagrass blue carbon stocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that following extreme seagrass degradation or loss, such as from overgrazing, carbon stored in the top meter of sediment may be vulnerable to remineralization and loss from the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

Sediments in seagrass meadows are often anoxic below the first few millimeters to centimeters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and we had predicted microbial activity and R<sub>H</sub> would increase following removal of the seagrass canopy due to increased water flow and aeration of the surface sediments. An increase in R<sub>H</sub> relative to R<sub>A</sub> would increase R<sub>E</sub> relative to GPP and therefore decrease the P:R ratio. That the P:R ratio was not affected by short-term experimental clipping or long-term natural grazing indicates that rates of R<sub>E</sub> were largely driven by the amount of aboveground seagrass biomass present rather than by R<sub>H</sub> in the benthos.</p><p id="Par16">Anaerobic metabolism and subsurface carbon dynamics can also play a role in seagrass meadow carbon cycling. We were unable to measure these processes in our study; however, we feel that these were likely to play a small role in total carbon dynamics in this system. Following a decrease in primary production and oxygen translocation to the rhizosphere, organic matter remineralization typically switches from aerobic respiration to sulfate reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>; however, rates of sulfate reduction are known to be low in carbonate-based sediments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, such as those in Little Cayman.

A similar relationship between grazing and sediment carbon has been shown in a Canadian salt marsh&#x02014;areas that had been grazed long-term by sheep exhibited higher soil organic carbon content as well as higher belowground biomass production than ungrazed areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. While seagrass meadows are resilient to long-term grazing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the resilience of meadows to external stressors (e.g. decreased light availability from coastal runoff and sedimentation/eutrophication) may differ between grazed and ungrazed areas experiencing high stress levels.

However, the high rates of GPP relative to R<sub>E</sub> in our system resulted in higher NEP than that reported for many other seagrass systems (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Some of these previously published rates could be low due to methodological reasons, as incubation time has been shown to influence measured metabolic rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (see Methods).

Here we show, through an <italic>in situ</italic> seagrass manipulation experiment and measurement of areas naturally grazed by green turtles, that rates of metabolic carbon uptake are lower in grazed areas than ungrazed areas. These differences in NEP correspond to a reduction in the potential of the meadow to sequester blue carbon in the future. However, grazing did not affect the P:R ratio of the meadow on short- or long-term time scales, suggesting that even sustained green turtle grazing is not likely to lead to a loss of sediment carbon through remineralization. These findings indicate that as more tropical seagrass habitats are returned to a natural grazed state, rates of carbon uptake and contribution to the metabolic carbon sink will be lower, but there will not be a large metabolic release of current blue carbon stocks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Site Description</title><p id="Par20">This experiment was conducted in seagrass meadows within Grape Tree Bay on the north side of Little Cayman, Cayman Islands (19&#x000b0;41&#x02032;48.0&#x02033; N, 80&#x000b0;03&#x02032;33.5&#x02033; W) at the Central Caribbean Marine Institute during May through August, 2016.

Unpublished data, and data from studies that did not meet our requirements above were excluded.</p><p id="Par36">This resulted in 58 unique estimates of seagrass metabolic rates&#x02014;54 from the literature, and four new values from our study. Thirty-eight of these estimates come from studies included in the Duarte <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> database, and we have compiled an additional 20 estimates of seagrass metabolism here. All data extracted from literature sources or the Duarte <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> database were recorded in their reported units, and then converted to units of mmol C m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> if needed. Values reported in oxygen units were converted to carbon units using photosynthetic and respiratory quotients of one.</p><p id="Par37">Not all studies from which values were obtained used the same methods for measuring metabolic rates. While the vast majority of studies used <italic>in situ</italic> incubation chambers, bell jars, or the diel O<sub>2</sub> curve method to measure seagrass metabolic rates, the length of time used for incubations or measurement varied among studies. It has been demonstrated that measured metabolic rates can be strongly affected by incubation length, and that longer incubations (e.g., 12 or 24-hour) tend to underestimate rates due to oxygen saturation or depletion within the chamber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that some seagrass metabolic rates reported in the literature are low due to methodological reasons, and the true rates in these systems may be higher than those reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="Par38">The compiled database of seagrass metabolic values collected from the literature (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) as well as the seagrass ecosystem metabolic data and seagrass biomass and morphometry data from this study (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) are available as supplementary information files.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
