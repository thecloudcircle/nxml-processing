It is a very useful diagnostic method, able to confirm the presence of compressive neuropathy, to determine its location and severity, thereby supporting case management. In addition, it can detect the presence of overlapping polyneuropathy or other compressive neuropathy or radiculopathy.</p><p>The principle that underlies the study of late responses consists in generating an excitation in the distal portion of the nerve, the impulse propagating proximally to the spinal cord, after which returning distally where can be recorded by the surface electrodes. The present study&#x02019;s aim was to analyze the late response parameters in order to determine the utility of each one, using a large number of cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The electrodiagnosis was made using a Neurospectrum 4/EPM (Neurosoft, 5, Voronin str, Ivanovo, 15032, Russia). We included a total of 325 patients with entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel (mean age: 58.52 years; standard deviation: 14.03; male/female ratio 53.85/46.15) and 36 patients with entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerve (mean age 49.86 years; standard deviation: 15.18; male/female ratio 33.33/66.67). The examination included the bilateral study of the median and ulnar nerves, and the assessment of 20 F-wave and 4 A-wave parameters. In some cases, the number of studied nerves and muscles was increased for an accurate diagnosis and also electromyography was performed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Studied parameters</title><p>The studied parameters for the F-wave were: minimum, average, maximum latency, chronodispersion and the difference between the F-wave minimum, average, maximum latency and the M-wave latency. Further studied were the proximal minimum, average, maximum velocity, tacheodispersion, the average and maximum ratio of F/M amplitudes, the percentage of high amplitude F-waves (greater than 1mV), F-wave persistence, the percentage of repetitive F-waves and the F ratio. In terms of right-left differences, we calculated: the right-left difference between the mean latencies and average velocities of the F-wave of the median/ulnar nerve and the difference in average latency of F-waves for the median/ulnar nerve and ipsilateral ulnar/median nerve. All calculations were performed bilaterally for the median and ulnar nerves.</p><p>The studied parameters for the A-wave were: amplitude, latency, latency difference between A-wave and F-wave and the calculated distance from the generating branch to the point of stimulation.</p><p>M-wave, F-wave and A-wave latencies were calculated from the deflexion of those waves, and the amplitudes were calculated peak-to-peak.</p><p>As conclusions, a composite score was formulated in which, along with the recommendations of the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AAEM) for entrapment neuropathies, the parameters having the highest percentage of changes have been considered.</p><p>The investigation method was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine - Transilvania University of Brasov. The study was accomplished according to the WMA Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were given a detailed explanation of the study and all provided a written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data collected were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010 for variable means, calculation of specific formulas, frequency graphs and histograms.

Parameters that have experienced changes in about half the cases were F-wave average and maximum latencies, chronodispersion, latency differences compared to the M-wave, low persistence, minimum and average velocity, tacheodispersion and right-left difference in the average velocity for the ulnar nerve. Data on F-wave average latency are consistent with Weber&#x02019;s study.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In contrast, the difference between the average latency of the ulnar nerve and ipsilateral median nerve was altered in almost three quarters of the patients. Thus, in the case of compressive neuropathy of the ulnar nerve, examination of the ipsilateral median nerve is needed, as this difference of F-wave average latencies shows significant changes.</p><p>Anastasopoulos<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> discussed the double crush syndrome, which in the present study was found in only 5% of the cases for compressive neuropathy of the median nerve and in 4% of the cases in the ulnar nerve.</p><p>Correlations that occurred in both types of entrapment neuropathies involved many late response parameters: Thus age is correlated with F-wave latency, entailing that a patient of older age is associated with a prolongation of the latency of these waves.</p><p>A further correlation emerged between chronodispersion and both F-wave latency and latency difference between F and M-waves, chronodispersion having greater values for increased latency. At the same time, the proximal velocity appeared related to tacheodispersion and F ratio, so a decrease in F-wave velocity will be associated with a decrease of the F ratio.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The present study confirmed the utility of F wave parameters in the electrodiagnosis of entrapment neuropathies. The composite score associates to the AAEM guidelines<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> the use of F-wave parameters as follows: for the median
