However, to date, there are few reliable biomarkers that can discriminate between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. In this study, we determined whether AKI is associated with altered serum and urinary levels of Klotho, S100A8/A9 (an endogenous ligand of toll-like receptor 4), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), which may allow differentiation between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. A volume-depleted pre-renal AKI model was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats fed a low-salt diet (0.03%) without water 96 h before two intraperitoneal (IP) injections of furosemide (20 mg/kg) at a 24 h interval. In contrast, in the cisplatin-induced intrinsic AKI model, animals were given a single IP injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg). All of the animals were euthanized 72 h after the first IP injection. Serum and urinary levels of Klotho, S100A8/A9, and NGAL were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also performed a proof-of-concept cross-sectional study to measure serum and urinary biomarkers in 61 hospitalized patients with established AKI. Compared to the intrinsic AKI group, the pre-renal AKI group showed a marked depression in urinary Klotho levels (13.21&#x000b1;17.32 vs. 72.97&#x000b1;17.96 pg/mL; P = 0.002). In addition, the intrinsic AKI group showed marked elevation of S100A8/A9 levels compared to the pre-renal AKI group (2629.97&#x000b1;598.05 ng/mL vs. 685.09&#x000b1;111.65 ng/mL; P = 0.002 in serum; 3361.11&#x000b1;250.86 ng/mL vs. 741.72&#x000b1;101.96 ng/mL; P = 0.003 in urine). There was no difference in serum and urinary NGAL levels between the pre-renal and intrinsic AKI groups. The proof-of-concept study with the hospitalized AKI patients also demonstrated decreased urinary Klotho in pre-renal AKI patients and increased urinary S100A8/A9 concentrations in intrinsic AKI patients. The attenuation of urinary Klotho and increase in urinary S100A8/A9 may allow differentiation between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Fresenius Medical Care Korea (141008-HRH2-A-59, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmc-korea.co.kr">http://www.fmc-korea.co.kr</ext-link>).

Despite remarkable progress in medical care, the incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients remains high [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prognosis of AKI depends crucially on the early and correct identification of the underlying cause of the disease and the immediate onset of therapy [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To date, it has been considered reliable to use serum creatinine for the diagnosis of AKI, but it is a somewhat inadequate gold standard for many reasons. Serum creatinine has poor specificity, because it is affected by age, gender, muscle mass, dietary intake, and medications, all of which may lead to changes in serum creatinine without actual kidney injury [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, serum creatinine may not change despite real tubular injury, because other nephrons may have an adequate compensatory renal reserve [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The use of serum creatinine may also cause delays in diagnosis and treatment because serum creatinine tends to increase slowly after injury [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, there has been recent interest in identifying novel AKI biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk stratification.</p><p>The various causes of AKI are commonly classified according to their origin as pre-renal, intrinsic, and post-renal. Whereas post-renal AKI is readily diagnosed by imaging studies, to date, there has been no reliable tool for differentiating between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. When renal dysfunction is improved within 24&#x02013;72 h solely by fluid resuscitation, it is usually considered that the patient has had pre-renal AKI. However, waiting to identify volume responsiveness is unacceptable in cases of crescentic glomerulonephritis, which require immediate diagnosis and treatment or acute tubular necrosis. Moreover, fluid resuscitation can endanger non-volume depleted patients and may lead to poor AKI outcomes, including mortality [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is another index for differentiating between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. Although FENa is widely used, its sensitivity and specificity are significantly decreased in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and sepsis, and with the use of diuretics.</p><p>A reliable non-invasive marker for discriminating between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI is desirable for its early differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which would improve outcomes in AKI patients. However, there have been few studies on discriminative markers for AKI. Previous research has shown that rat <italic>klotho</italic> mRNA expression is markedly decreased by acute inflammatory stress, but not by hypovolemic stress [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, we presume that <italic>klotho</italic> might differentiate between functional loss and structural damage in the kidney. S100A8/A9, an activator of the innate immune system, is increased in various inflammatory disorders [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that inflammatory responses concerned with the innate and adaptive immune systems contribute considerably to parenchymal damage in AKI [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, we presume that S100A8/A9 may be elevated in intrinsic AKI due to the increased inflammatory response, whereas it may not be elevated in pre-renal AKI due to the absence of epithelial damage and inflammation. This might allow discrimination between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is one of the most widely studied novel biomarkers in the pathophysiology of AKI. A recent study reported that urinary NGAL concentrations were higher in patients with intrinsic AKI than those with pre-renal AKI [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, we attempted to identify the discriminative function of NGAL between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI.</p><p>This study was conducted to evaluate new AKI biomarkers, including serum and urinary levels of Klotho, S100A8/A9, and NGAL, for differentiating between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. We also conducted a proof-of-concept study to determine if biomarkers effective for animal models can also differentiate between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI in hospitalized AKI patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>Eighteen male Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Orient Bio (Seongnam City, Gyeonggi Province, Korea).

Adult (aged over 18 years old) patients with AKI who had been admitted to the general ward or intensive care units in Gachon University Gil Medical Center between January and December 2014 were eligible for enrollment. AKI was defined as a rapid (within 48 h) decline in renal function, designated as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL, a percentage increase in serum creatinine of at least 50%, or documented oliguria of less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 6 h [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Patients were excluded for post-renal obstruction as a cause of AKI, previous history of RRT, or renal transplantation. Patients were considered to have pre-renal AKI when the rise in serum creatinine concentration had been caused by factors that reduce renal perfusion, such as dehydration, bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, and cardiorenal syndrome, and when creatinine recovered rapidly to baseline after volume repletion within 3 days. Recovery from AKI was defined by the improvement of creatinine to baseline levels in patients who have followed this hospital with known baseline creatinine. In case of in-hospital AKI, reverse decrease of creatinine from AKIN classification (absolute decrease in serum creatinine of at least 0.3mg/dL or a percent decrease in serum creatinine of at least 50%) or to the level of before AKI occurrence was considered to recover from AKI. In addition, patients with pre-renal AKI had no previous exposure history to insults that result in intrinsic kidney injury. Patients were considered to have intrinsic AKI when the increased serum creatinine concentration did not respond to fluid replacement within 3 days and/or was associated with nephrotoxic events, such as hypotension, sepsis, interstitial nephritis, contrast-induced AKI, and glomerulonephritis.</p><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Gachon University Gil Medical Center (GAIRB2014&#x02013;202).

Renal Klotho expression was decreased in a VD animal model, and renal S100A8/A9 expression was increased in a CDDP-induced intrinsic AKI model. Renal S100A8/A9 expression in the intrinsic AKI model may be related to the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages.</p><p>A defect in the <italic>klotho</italic> gene results in a syndrome similar to aging [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas overexpression of the <italic>klotho</italic> gene extends life span [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Klotho is expressed in the kidney, brain [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], pituitary, parathyroid [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], pancreas, ovary, testis, and placenta [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. After its discovery in 1997 [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], subsequent studies have demonstrated various functions of the Klotho protein including anti-oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], anti-apoptosis, anti-senescence [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], promotion of angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and inhibition of fibrogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, full-length Klotho, a single-pass transmembrane protein, functions as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor-23, thus inhibiting phosphate absorption and promoting phosphaturia by inhibiting 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D3 synthesis, which may contribute to the prevention of vascular calcification [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

Animal studies have shown transient renal Klotho deficiency in AKI under a variety of conditions, including hypovolemia [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], nephrotoxins such as CDDP and folic acid [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], lipopolysaccharides [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and ureteric obstruction [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, there is limited data on whether Klotho may differentiate functional loss from structural damage in the kidney.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that serum and urinary Klotho levels significantly decreased in the VD-induced AKI model versus the CDDP-induced AKI model. In the proof-of-concept human study, urinary Klotho concentrations and the urinary Klotho/creatinine ratio were also decreased in the intrinsic AKI group compared to the pre-renal AKI group. These findings suggest that decreased urinary Klotho and the Klotho/creatinine ratio may represent loss of renal function. The results of this study are in accordance with previous observations, showing downregulation of Klotho expression in dehydration [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the current study differed from a study that showed downregulation of Klotho in a CDDP-induced AKI animal model [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. That study did not measure serum or urinary Klotho, but only reported renal Klotho protein expression and <italic>KL</italic> mRNA transcripts. Moreover, only a mouse model was examined. Further studies are needed to determine whether the temporal changes in urinary Klotho during the time course of AKI may alter these findings, and whether the degree of urinary Klotho could reflect the degree of functional loss.</p><p>S100A8/A9 is calcium- and zinc-binding protein, consisting of a heterotetramer of S100A8 and S100A9 [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is predominantly derived from neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but can also be produced by monocytes, activated macrophages, dendritic cells, and mucosal squamous epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. S100A8/A9 is an activator (mediator protein) of the innate immune system and an amplifier of inflammatory activity via activation of Toll-like receptor 4 [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. S100A8/A9 is an excellent biomarker of inflammatory processes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, elevated S100A8/A9 plasma concentrations are an independent risk predictor for cardiovascular events in both healthy individuals [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and patients with acute coronary syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is also useful as a candidate for the detection of unstable versus stable coronary artery plaques [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Increased expression of S100A8/A9 has also been recently identified in various human cancers [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the field of gastroenterology, fecal S100A8/A9 is a well-known biomarker for differentiating between inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome (a functional disorder without inflammation). Because there is no epithelial inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome, fecal S100A8/A9 concentrations are low. However, they are highly elevated in inflammatory bowel disease. Based on the absence of inflammatory damage in pre-renal AKI, it may be that the S100A8/A9 level does not increase in pre-renal AKI, whereas it is elevated in intrinsic AKI.</p><p>In the present study, animal experiments indicated that serum and urinary S100A8/A9 concentrations were elevated in CDDP-induced AKI versus the control groups, whereas there was no significant change in the VD group. In the proof-of-concept human study, the urinary S100A9/A9/creatinine ratio was also elevated in the intrinsic AKI group versus the pre-renal AKI group. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy findings suggested that S100A8/A9 expression was increased in intrinsic AKI, and its expression was from the recruited inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and macrophages at the glomerular and tubule-interstitial space. These findings suggested that the increased urinary S100A8/A9/creatinine ratio represented structural damage and enhanced inflammatory activity of the kidney. Larger multicenter studies are needed for further validation of the use of S100A8/A9 in heterogeneous patient populations and for defining cut-off values for differential diagnosis and outcomes of AKI. Our results were consistent with those of other studies suggesting that urinary S100A8/A9 concentrations can be used to differentiate between intrinsic and pre-renal AKI [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Human NGAL was originally recognized as being bound to gelatinase in specific granules of the neutrophil. NGAL is synthesized during granulocyte maturation in the bone marrow [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and is normally expressed in several human tissues, including the kidneys, lungs, prostate, uterus, stomach, and colon [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. NGAL expression is induced markedly in injured epithelia in the setting of inflammation or malignancy [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. NGAL is one of seven genes that show increased expression within the first several hours following ischemic or CDDP-induced nephrotoxic renal injury in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. NGAL protein is highly expressed in kidney proximal tubule cells after ischemic or CDDP-induced renal injury and readily detected in the blood and urine shortly after AKI.</p><p>NGAL is one of the most widely studied and most promising biomarkers of AKI to date. It has been investigated in various clinical settings of AKI, such as after cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac surgery [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], sepsis-associated AKI [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], contrast-induced AKI [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], in critically ill patients [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], in patients admitted to the emergency department [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and AKI following kidney transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies showed that urinary NGAL discriminates intrinsic AKI from normal renal function, pre-renal AKI, and CKD in the emergency department [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and effectively distinguishes pre-renal from intrinsic AKI in all hospitalized patients [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, serum NGAL and urinary NGAL/creatinine were higher in the intrinsic AKI animal model; however, serum NGAL was higher in pre-renal AKI patients. We suggest that this may be affected by the somewhat higher serum creatinine concentration among pre-renal AKI patients than intrinsic AKI, although it was not statistically significant. In addition, the proportion of stage 3 AKI patients by the AKIN criteria also tended to be higher in prerenal AKI than intrinsic AKI. Because previous reports have shown that urinary NGAL is correlated with the degree of renal damage [<xref rid="pone.0147255.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], this different degree of renal dysfunction may affect the level of NGAL in both types of AKI patients. Further larger-scale studies are needed to determine the discriminative role of NGAL in AKI patients.</p><p>The attenuation of urinary Klotho and increase in urinary S100A8/A9 may contribute to discriminating between pre-renal and intrinsic AKI. The increased S100A8/A9 may indicate an activated immune response and inflammation in intrinsic AKI. Further studies are needed to assess whether biomarker combinations are likely to improve our ability to predict the cause of AKI and its outcomes and to validate the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarker combinations in larger, heterogeneous patient populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We appreciate the cooperation of Gachon University Gil Medical Center Bio Bank for giving us the biospecimens and thorough data of enrolled patients (No: GBB2014&#x02013;04).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0147255.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Chertow</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Burdick</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Honour</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bonventre</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bates</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name> (<year>2005</year>) <article-title>Acute kidney injury, mortality, length of stay, and costs in hospitalized patients</article-title>. <source>J Am Soc Nephrol</source>
