EBV infection is associated with the development of several cancers, including Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Elevated levels of anti-EBV antibodies have been associated with increased risk of HL. There is growing evidence that genetic factors control the levels of antibodies against EBV antigens. Here, we conducted linkage and association studies to search for genetic factors influencing either anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) or anti-Epstein Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) IgG levels in a unique cohort of 424 individuals of European origin from 119 French families recruited through a Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patient. No major locus controlling anti-VCA antibody levels was identified. However, we found that the HLA region influenced anti-EBNA-1 IgG titers. Refined association studies in this region identified a cluster of HLA class II variants associated with anti-EBNA-1 IgG titers (e.g. p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5&#x000d7;10&#x02013;5 for rs9268403). The major allele of rs9268403 conferring a predisposition to high anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels was also associated with an increased risk of HL (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). In summary, this study shows that HLA class II variants influenced anti-EBNA-1 IgG titers in a European population. It further shows the role of the same variants in the risk of HL.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer, Ligue Nationale contre le cancer, Fondation de France, and Inserm.

Primary EBV infection is mostly asymptomatic during childhood, but may be associated with infectious mononucleosis if it occurs later in life. The virus is transmitted in saliva. It then infects the epithelial cells and B lymphocytes of the oropharynx and spreads throughout the lymphoid tissues, remaining latent in memory B cells <xref rid="pone.0102501-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This latent phase is usually asymptomatic, but EBV is associated with several cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) <xref rid="pone.0102501-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The EBV antigens classically used for serological testing include Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) and viral capsid antigen (VCA). EBNA-1 is expressed during latent infection, reflecting a history of infection, and VCA is expressed during lytic infection, thus reflecting reactivation. Recent studies have provided evidence for a role of genetic factors in the control of both anti-VCA and anti-EBNA-1 immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels. High heritability has been reported for both anti-VCA IgG levels in three familial samples of different origins <xref rid="pone.0102501-Besson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and for anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels in a Mexican American sample <xref rid="pone.0102501-Rubicz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In this second study, a combined linkage and association study showed that at least two separate loci within the HLA region influenced anti-EBNA-1 antibody production. We carried out linkage and association studies to search for genetic factors influencing either anti-VCA or anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels in a French familial sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Families and serological methods</title><p>Families of European origin were recruited through index cases of HL as described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0102501-Besson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102501-Besson2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Briefly, HL cases were recruited from three haematology units in the Paris area. Patients were included at diagnosis or whilst in complete remission, at least one year after diagnosis. Inclusion criteria were age between 15 and 35 years and negative serological tests for HIV at diagnosis. First-degree relatives (parents and siblings) of the patients were asked to participate in the study. Anti-VCA IgG and anti-EBNA-1 IgG titers were determined with ELISA kits (ImmunoWELL) and are expressed in international units per liter <xref rid="pone.0102501-Besson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102501-Besson3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Serological measurements were performed in the same laboratory, with ELISA kits from the same batch, by the same technician. Anti-VCA IgG and anti-EBNA-1 IgG titers were determined twice in 72 and 78 individuals, respectively. The intraclass correlation was high and similar for the two measures, with a value of 0.95 and 0.93, for anti-VCA and anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels, respectively. Positive serological results for EBV were defined as having either an anti-VCA IgG titer or an anti-EBNA-1 IgG titer above the corresponding threshold established by the manufacturer of the ELISA kits, ie only individuals who are negative for both tests were considered as having a negative EBV serology. IgG levels were determined by nephelometry.

Genotyping was performed with the Illumina HumanCytoSNP12v2.1 Panel, containing 299,140 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Quality control (QC) for the data was performed with PLINK software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/">http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/</ext-link>).

In total, 255,341 high-quality SNPs were considered for further analysis. For individuals, we excluded three samples based on a call rate &#x0003c;98% and/or the presence of Mendelian errors, resulting in the limitation of the analysis to 414 subjects. For linkage analyses, we selected 40,783 common SNPs (MAF&#x02265;0.2) displaying low levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r<sup>2</sup>&#x02264;0.2).

We generated phenotypes under different underlying genetic models, and keeping the familial structure (and the number of individuals) as well as the genotyping data as they were really observed in our sample. As genetic models, we considered a diallelic locus (minor allelic frequency of 0.45) influencing a quantitative phenotype with an additive effect and leading to a trait heritability ranging from 0.3 to 0.5. We generated 100 replicates for each heritability value and we performed linkage analysis in each replicate. The power of our sample to observe a suggestive linkage was 37%, 50%, 66%, 83%, and 97% for heritability values of 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, and 0.5, respectively.</p><p>Family-based association tests (FBATs) were carried out on linked regions with FBAT software, version 2.0.3, to test for association in the classical transmission disequilibrium test with the empirical variance, to account for linkage <xref rid="pone.0102501-Horvath1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Our final sample included 414 genotyped EBV-positive subjects from 119 nuclear families. The mean age of the individuals was 44 years (range: 14.5&#x02013;87.4 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 0.82. For linkage analyses, 86 families were informative, i.e. with at least two available offspring. The phenotypes of interest were anti-VCA and anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels, expressed in international units per liter. In our sample, the distributions of anti-VCA and anti-EBNA-1 IgG titers were strongly skewed to the right. We therefore used the decimal logarithm of these traits in all our analyses.

Two SNPs, rs9268403 and rs9268454, in perfect LD (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1), were found to be associated with anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and, for the sake of simplicity, we present only the results for rs9268403, as identical results were obtained for rs9268454. As the frequency of the minor allele C of rs9268403 was low (MAF&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.23), with few CC homozygotes, we also performed the analysis with a dominant model for the C allele, in which a more significant association was detected (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). Offspring homozygous for the major allele (T) of rs9268403 had higher anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels than CT/CC subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102501_new-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As the association analysis was based on familial tests, we also investigated anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels as a function of rs9268403 genotype in the 167 available parents, providing additional information independent of the familial transmission of alleles. We observed the same association, with TT parents having significantly higher anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.033) than CT/CC parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102501_new-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These findings provide strong support for the association of rs9268403 with anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels.</p><fig id="pone-0102501_new-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0102501.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Anti-EBNA-1 IgG distributions among offspring and parent samples as a function of their genotype.</title><p>Mean titers (black circles) with 95% confidence interval for anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels are shown as a function of the genotype at rs9268403 under a dominant model for the minor allele C (TT vs CC/CT).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0102501.g002"/></fig><p>We then carried out imputation in the linkage region, using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. In total, 51,030 SNPs could be imputed with imputation information scores&#x02265;0.6 and a MAF&#x02265;0.05, including 84 SNPs in strong LD (r<sup>2</sup>&#x02265;0.8) with rs9268403 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102501.s003">Table S1</xref>). An association study with the imputed SNPs based on FBAT-dosage confirmed that the best signals were obtained with the cluster of SNPs in strong LD with rs9268403. This cluster of 86 SNPs (including rs9268403 and rs9268454) is located between 32.34 Mb and 32.43 Mb, in a region overlapping the genes <italic>C6orf10, HCG23</italic> and <italic>BTNL2</italic>, close to <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102501_new-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

We were able to replicate the effect of rs477515 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017, r<sup>2</sup> with rs9268403&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.62 in European population) and rs2516049 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007, r<sup>2</sup> with rs9268403&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.74), the two most significant SNPs of this previous study, located &#x0223c;200 kb from rs9268403 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102501_new-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In both studies, the minor allele was associated with lower anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels. The other SNPs reported in the previous study <xref rid="pone.0102501-Rubicz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> were not significantly associated with anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels in our sample. The previous study was conducted in Mexican American subjects, and allele frequencies and LD patterns differ between the MEX and CEU HapMap populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102501.s003">Table S1</xref>), potentially accounting, at least in part, for the observed difference between the two studies.</p><p>We then investigated whether our associated SNPs had been described as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), using data from the GTEx eQTL database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtex/GTEX2/gtex.cgi">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtex/GTEX2/gtex.cgi</ext-link>), which explores eQTL loci in lymphoblastoid cells. Eight of the 86 SNPs from our cluster had been reported to be significantly associated with mRNA levels for HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DQB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102501.s004">Table S2</xref>). One of the most significant findings was the association between rs9268403 and HLA-DQA1 expression. The 27 SNPs reported in the previous study <xref rid="pone.0102501-Rubicz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> were eQTLs for the same three genes and for HLA-DRB5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102501.s004">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, rs2516049, the SNP we were able to replicate in our sample, had also been identified as an eQTL for HLA-DQA1. Among these HLA class II loci of interest we were able to impute reliable four digits HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles <xref rid="pone.0102501-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> in &#x0223c;85% of our study subjects. We observed moderate LD of rs9268403 with three HLA- DQA1 (*0201, r2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.16; *0301, r2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.17;*0303, r2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.18), and two HLA-DQB1 (*0202, r2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.31; *0302, r2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.18) alleles. However, none of these HLA alleles provided significant association with anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels.</p><p>Finally, we also made use of our sample recruited through HL probands to test the association of rs9268403 with HL in FBAT. The major allele (T) of rs9268403, which is associated with higher levels of anti-EBNA-1 antibodies, was also significantly associated (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) with a higher risk of HL. Several HLA variants had already been shown to be associated with HL in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) <xref rid="pone.0102501-Urayama1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and five were reported in the Phenotype-Genotype Integrator database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102501.s004">Table S2</xref>). Two of these variants were found to be in strong LD with rs9268403, this LD being strongest for rs2395185 (r<sup>2</sup> with rs9268403&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.52).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the genetic control of anti-VCA and anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels. We found no evidence for linkage with a locus specifically controlling anti-VCA IgG levels. However, it should be noted that our sample had limited power to detect suggestive linkage with a locus providing a trait heritability lower than 0.35 (see methods). In contrast, we were able to replicate the implication of the HLA region in the regulation of anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels. Association studies on this region provided strong evidence for a role of rs9268403, which is part of a large cluster of SNPs in strong LD.</p><p>We were also able to replicate the implication of the two most significant SNPs, rs2516049 and rs477515, identified in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0102501-Rubicz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, both of which are in substantial LD with rs9268403 in European populations (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.6). Both rs9268403 and rs2516049 have been identified as eQTLs for the same HLA class II genes, including HLA-DQA1 in particular. We could perform imputation for HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles, and none of them showed a significant association with anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels. However our SNP data are not optimal to impute HLA class II alleles, and a detailed investigation of their effect will need further in-depth studies with the complete molecular genotyping of HLA class II variants.</p><p>Finally, the major allele of rs9268403 predisposing to high levels of anti-EBNA-1 antibodies was also associated with an increased risk of HL. This result is consistent with the known association of elevated levels of anti-EBNA antibodies with increased risk of HL <xref rid="pone.0102501-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, rs9268403 was also found to be in LD with at least one SNP associated with HL in GWAS. Further studies are required to determine whether the genetic control of anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels can account, at least in part, for the genetic control of HL, and to identify precisely the HLA class II variants involved. This work will be particularly challenging, due to the high level of LD reported for this HLA region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0102501.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
