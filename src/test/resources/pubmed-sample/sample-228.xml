This deluge of data should improve our knowledge of the various primary and secondary metabolisms of Fungi, including their synthesis of useful compounds such as antibiotics or toxic molecules such as mycotoxins. Functional annotation of many fungal genomes is imperfect, especially of genes encoding enzymes, so we need dedicated tools to analyze their metabolic pathways in depth.</p></sec><sec><title>Description</title><p>FUNGIpath is a new tool built using a two-stage approach. Groups of orthologous proteins predicted using complementary methods of detection were collected in a relational database. Each group was further mapped on to steps in the metabolic pathways published in the public databases KEGG and MetaCyc. As a result, FUNGIpath allows the primary and secondary metabolisms of the different fungal species represented in the database to be compared easily, making it possible to assess the level of specificity of various pathways at different taxonomic distances. It is freely accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fungipath.u-psud.fr">http://www.fungipath.u-psud.fr</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>As more and more fungal genomes are expected to be sequenced during the coming years, FUNGIpath should help progressively to reconstruct the ancestral primary and secondary metabolisms of the main branches of the fungal tree of life and to elucidate the evolution of these ancestral fungal metabolisms to various specific derived metabolisms.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Currently, the Fungi have more published nuclear genome sequences than any other eukaryotic taxonomic group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This relative abundance (28 genomes in May 2009) can be explained by their economic significance and their moderate genome size [Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Since several species are model organisms for fundamental, medical, or agronomical and industrial studies (e.g. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>), fungal genomes seem suitable for large-scale comparative studies, which will allow their evolution to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have already performed extensive comparisons of a few fungal genomes to predict groups of orthologous proteins, using published methods such as Inparanoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], OrthoMCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or TribeMcl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>However, current information about the number of fungal enzymes involved in metabolic pathways is rather scanty and is heterogeneously distributed in major public curated databases, both universal (Swiss-Prot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) and specialized (KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and MetaCyc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). To perform an extensive comparison of these various databases containing enzymatic information we propose to identify each enzyme by its ID-EC, which associates its protein identifier (ID) with the EC number allocated by the IUBMB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> illustrates this paucity of knowledge; it shows the respective distributions per species in both protein databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and pathway databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] of ID-ECs and their respective medians in the animal, plant and fungal kingdoms. Swiss-Prot displays as many as 335 fungal species containing at least one ID-EC, but their median values are as low as two ID-ECs per species (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In contrast, only 27 fungal species are included in KEGG (which is restricted to complete published genomes), but their median values are as high as 855 ID-ECs per species (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This contrast is mainly because the public databases surveyed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> include data on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which is among the three best fungal genomes correctly annotated at the enzymatic level (data not shown). Most other fungi have limited or null functional annotation, explaining why the median values are so low in MetaCyc and Swiss-Prot.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of ID-EC per kingdom in public databases</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="3">Number of species displaying IDs annotated with EC number (ID-EC)</th><th align="center" colspan="3">Median value of the set of ID-EC found per species</th></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="6"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th/><th align="center">KEGG</th><th align="center">MetaCyc</th><th align="center">Swiss-Prot</th><th align="center">KEGG</th><th align="center">MetaCyc</th><th align="center">Swiss-Prot</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Animal</td><td align="center">38</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">1252</td><td align="center">2021</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Fungi</td><td align="center">27</td><td align="center">14</td><td align="center">335</td><td align="center">855</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Plant</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">158</td><td align="center">915</td><td align="center">1051</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>This remarkable situation arises largely because there is currently no tool for large-scale analyses of fungal metabolism, except for a preliminary attempt to identify enzymes in pathogenic fungi for a limited number of metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To cope with this major shortcoming, we designed a tool that allows us to mine genomic data by combining two complementary approaches: (i) defining reliable groups of orthologous proteins and (ii) mapping these groups on to the metabolic pathways that are described in KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and MetaCyc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Organizing relevant data for analyzing fungal metabolic pathways</title><sec><title>Identifying enzyme activities requires relevant prediction of orthologs</title><p>As more and more genomic data become available, homology can be used to reconstruct the metabolic pathways of newly-sequenced organisms, taking the pathways of well-studied model organisms such as yeast as reference. Accordingly, one must identify the amino acid sequences encoding each step of each pathway in organisms that have not been studied experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, there are two major drawbacks in this transfer of information. First, the accuracy of functional annotation of many fungal genomes is low because experimental data are lacking except in the case of yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Secondly, it is difficult to predict reliable orthologs among all the putative homologs detected during exhaustive comparison of pairs of genomes. Numerous methods have been published but none appears completely infallible (for a recent review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Thus, we decided to apply independent methods to the same dataset, collect as many potential orthologs as possible, and then compute their overlap. Exploring several methods raised the probability of finding consistent groups corresponding to this overlap. Accordingly, we used three different and complementary approaches based on similarity searches, and another based on the analysis of phylogenetic trees of families of homologs.</p><sec><title>Searching pertinent orthologs</title><p>First, two published methods were used with their respective default parameters. Inparanoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] allows us to identify the orthologs and the inparalogs (genes duplicated since the last speciation event) during pairwise genome comparison. OrthoMCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] permits consistent strongly-related groups of orthologs (including inparalogs) to be identified.</p><p>Secondly, we improved the classical all-versus-all BLASTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] approach to identifying pairs of best reciprocal hits (BRH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with a dedicated Perl script, enhancing the definition of orthologs by specifying two parameters, the alignment percentage and the score ratio, to filter the BLAST results. Local conservation was avoided by dividing the alignment length of each aligned sequence by its total length. The score ratio is defined as the ratio of the raw BLAST score computed by aligning a pair of sequences to the raw score of each sequence against itself (i.e. maximum score). Only results with score ratios over 0.2 and alignment percentages above 60% were kept for further studies.</p><p>These different methods based on sequence similarity yield various clusters of orthologous proteins that are more or less stringent depending whether single (e.g. Inparanoid) or multiple (e.g. BRH [Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]) links are used to build the orthologous protein groups.</p><p>Besides these methods based on similarity approaches, methods based on phylogenetic analysis have recently been developed to build orthologous groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here we chose a phylogenetic approach we had previously developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] to obtain groups of orthologous proteins, using automated analysis of trees of families of homologous proteins without a reference tree. The homologous proteins were first detected using BLASTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] with the following constraints: an E-value less than 0.001 and an alignment extending for at least 70% of the length of the shorter matching protein. For each family, a multiple alignment was built with Muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and the phylogenetic tree deduced was reconstructed using PhyML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The program Retree from the Phylip package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] was further used to root the tree in order to distinguish orthologs from paralogs using automatic tree analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows a strikingly low overlap between the results obtained by applying these four methods to the 20 fungal genomes under study. The first column shows that the highest number of groups of orthologs is obtained with the BRH method. However, this may be partly artifactual since BRH is the only method in which an amino acid sequence can belong to different groups owing to the formation of multiple links [Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Columns three to six show the relative percentages shared among the different methods as a double matrix. The upper matrix shows that the relative percentages of identical groups are generally low; the highest figure is 22.4% (common to the OrthoMCL and Inparanoid outputs). The lower matrix shows the percentage of groups that are unique to one of the two methods compared. The low figures obtained (ranging from 8 to 32.6%) suggest that each method brings specific information. The highest specificities are found with the phylogenetic approach, which is indeed the most distinctive of the four approaches we used.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Groups of orthologous proteins for the 20 genomes available in FUNGIpath predicted by four different methods</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Total Number</th><th align="center" colspan="5">Relative percentage sharing between two methods</th></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="5"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th align="center">BRH</th><th align="center">Inparanoid</th><th align="center">OrthoMCL</th><th align="center">Phylogeny</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">52292</td><td align="center">BRH</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">4.8%</td><td align="center">3.7%</td><td align="center">5.8%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">18235</td><td align="center">Inparanoid</td><td align="center">8.0%</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">22.4%</td><td align="center">8.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">20379</td><td align="center">OrthoMCL</td><td align="center">12.4%</td><td align="center">16.3%</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">8.3%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">12676</td><td align="center">Phylogeny</td><td align="center">32.4%</td><td align="center">25.9%</td><td align="center">32.6%</td><td align="center">-</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>upper triangular matrix: percentage of identical groups</p><p>lower triangular matrix: percentage of specific groups</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Identifying biologically relevant groups of orthologs</title><p>Although the overlap between these different methods for detecting orthologs appears narrow, we tried to build a consensus of the groups of orthologs using both union and intersection methods. Consideration of all the orthologs found merged large numbers of proteins (2,694 proteins in the largest group), with a trend towards amalgamating sometimes quite distant groups of orthologs. On the other hand, computing the crude intersection of the different methods also seemed inadequate (32 proteins in the largest group), since the BRH approach does not detect the inparalogs found by the other methods.</p><p>To cope with these difficulties, we modified the intersection approach, using a two-step strategy based on enrichment of the reference groups, i.e. the groups of orthologs obtained by the crude intersection approach. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a flowchart of our approach. (i) For each reference group, the sequences were aligned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and their corresponding HMM profile was computed using the HMMER hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To avoid any bias due to the numerous inparalogs present in some species, only one homologous gene per genome was conserved as the reference ortholog building the individual HMM profiles. (ii) All the computed HMM profiles were organized as a database, and each sequence not included in any reference group was further compared to the database using the HMMER hmmpfam program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] in order to add it to a reference group using stringent threshold. Indeed, to build sound <italic>final </italic>groups, we limited the assignment of a sequence to a reference group if the E-value was less than a threshold of 10<sup>-10 </sup>[Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. This stringent criterion allowed a good balance to be kept between sensitivity (29.2% of the sequences initially not associated with a reference group were now associated with one) and specificity (64.2% of the sequences initially found by at least one method but associated with several groups of orthologs were now associated with only one).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart of the construction of orthologous groups</bold>. The diagram represents an overview of our annotation process. We applied four methods of orthologous predictions (BRH, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL and Phylogeny) to 20 fungal genomes. We compared the different groups (represented in the diagram by the sequences S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5) and we constructed their intersections (represented in the diagram by S1, S2 and S3). For each intersection, we aligned the sequences using Muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and built a HMM profile using HMMER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. All these HMM profiles were merged in one file to create a HMM database. Thus, we searched all sequences without a group (S4 and S5 for instance) for shared similarity with one HMM profile (HMMER hmmpfam program) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. According to the E-value, we attributed the sequence (E-value &#x02264; 10<sup>-10</sup>) to the corresponding group or excluded it from that group (E-value &#x0003e; 10<sup>-10</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-11-81-1"/></fig><p>In total, we obtained 12,850 final groups of orthologs (size &#x02265; 2) that appear biologically relevant, the largest group containing 297 sequences (see the size distribution in [Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>]). These figures suggest a good compromise when compared with the values obtained using the crude union and intersection methods (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). With such a prediction, 57% of the total sequences were associated with a group of orthologs [Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>]. The mean number of homologous proteins per genome is close to 1.3 in all final groups, suggesting that the orthology/paralogy relationships are quite well resolved by our enrichment approach. Comparison of our ortholog predictions with the four initial methods (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>) shows that our approach gives results different from each separate method. The highest number of identical groups with FUNGIpath is obtained with OrthoMCL, whereas the lowest percentage of specific groups is obtained with Inparanoid and BRH.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Sampling the orthologs in relevant groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Method</th><th align="center">Union</th><th align="center">Intersection</th><th align="center">HMM profile and enrichment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Total number of groups</td><td align="center">12985</td><td align="center">12985</td><td align="center">12850</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Size of the largest group</td><td align="center">2694</td><td align="center">32</td><td align="center">297</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparing the orthologous groups predicted by FUNGIpath and by the four methods initially used</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center">BRH</th><th align="center">Inparanoid</th><th align="center">OrthoMCL</th><th align="center">Phylogeny</th><th align="center">Average</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Percent of groups identical with FUNGIpath</td><td align="center">2.8%</td><td align="center">18.6%</td><td align="center">18.8%</td><td align="center">10.7%</td><td align="center"><bold>12.7%</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Percent of groups specific in FUNGIpath</td><td align="center">10.6%</td><td align="center">10.6%</td><td align="center">23.4%</td><td align="center">24.6%</td><td align="center"><bold>17.3%</bold></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Assessing the reliability of the predicted final groups of orthologs</title><p>To ascertain the reliability of our predictions further, we computed a confidence score <italic>S </italic>for each final group of orthologous proteins, as follows:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-11-81-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>m </italic>is the number of methods used for orthology prediction, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>F, i </italic></sub>is the number of orthologs shared (intersection) between the result of method <italic>i </italic>and the final group of orthologs, O<sub><italic>F </italic></sub>is the number of orthologs in the final group and G<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>is the number of groups obtained by method <italic>i </italic>for the set of proteins composing the final group.

We then searched all the HMM profiles against the sequences annotated with a valid four-digit EC number available in Swiss-Prot release 56.7 using the HMMER hmmsearch program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). The Swiss-Prot functional annotation was transferred to all members of a group of orthologs displaying a best hit E-value &#x02264; 10<sup>-80</sup>.

Although we mainly used Swiss-Prot data to predict enzymatic annotation in FUNGIpath, the relative percentage of identical ID-ECs was only 68%: 16% of Swiss-Prot annotations were not confirmed by the experimental strategy we used to build FUNGIpath, while 16% of FUNGIpath predictions were absent from Swiss-Prot.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Comparing the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>enzymatic data published in four different databases with those predicted in FUNGIpath</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th/><th/><th align="center" colspan="3">Distribution of ID-EC (percentage of larger database content)</th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th/><th/><th colspan="3"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center">Database 1</th><th align="center">Total ID-EC</th><th align="center">Database 2</th><th align="center">Total ID-EC</th><th align="center">Identical</th><th align="center">Specific to database 1</th><th align="center">Specific to database 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">KEGG</td><td align="center">1101</td><td align="center">MetaCyc</td><td align="center">155</td><td align="center">127 (11%)</td><td align="center">974 (86%)</td><td align="center">28 (2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">KEGG</td><td align="center">1101</td><td align="center">SGD</td><td align="center">527</td><td align="center">409 (34%)</td><td align="center">692 (57%)</td><td align="center">118 (10%)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">KEGG</td><td align="center">1101</td><td align="center">Swiss-Prot</td><td align="center">1261</td><td align="center">889 (60%)</td><td align="center">212 (14%)</td><td align="center">372 (25%)</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>KEGG</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1101</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>FUNGIpath</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1261</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>844 (56%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>417 (27%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>257 (17%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="center">MetaCyc</td><td align="center">155</td><td align="center">SGD</td><td align="center">527</td><td align="center">132 (24%)</td><td align="center">23 (4%)</td><td align="center">395 (72%)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">MetaCyc</td><td align="center">155</td><td align="center">Swiss-Prot</td><td align="center">1261</td><td align="center">136 (11%)</td><td align="center">19 (1%)</td><td align="center">1125 (88%)</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>MetaCyc</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>155</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>FUNGIpath</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1261</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>134 (10%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>21 (2%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1127 (88%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="center">SGD</td><td align="center">527</td><td align="center">Swiss-Prot</td><td align="center">1261</td><td align="center">433 (32%)</td><td align="center">94 (7%)</td><td align="center">828 (61%)</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>SGD</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>527</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>FUNGIpath</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1261</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>419 (31%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>842 (62%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>108 (8%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>FUNGIpath</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1261</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Swiss-Prot</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1261</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>1024 (68%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>237 (16%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>237 (16%)</bold></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To understand these differences better, we looked more closely at the similarities of EC numbers between FUNGIpath and the four public databases. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref> shows the distribution of identities at each digit of the shared EC numbers. It appears that the FUNGIpath predictions correspond to more than 80% of the EC numbers found in the other databases. In addition, it can be seen that almost all the differences are limited to the fourth digit, corresponding mainly to the nature of the substrate of the enzyme compared. If we compare our predictions with a predictor such as PRIAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we note that 50.9% of the enzymatic annotations are identical and only 6.8% are different (the difference being mainly in the last EC number digit). The remaining 42.3% are specific to PRIAM (18.6%) or FUNGIpath (23.7%). Thus, the reliability of the automatic approach used by FUNGIpath, predicting groups of orthologous proteins and annotating their enzymatic function, seems comparable with that of other tools or the independently curated public databases. This is true whether the functional annotation is based mainly on experimental data (e.g. SGD) or on sequence similarity (e.g. KEGG).</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Comparing the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>enzymatic data predicted in FUNGIpath with public databases</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="center" colspan="2">Number of ID-EC in FUNGIpath</th><th align="center" colspan="4">Number of differences at digit position</th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="2"><hr/></th><th colspan="4"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Public Database</th><th align="center">Total ID-EC in FUNGIpath</th><th align="center">identical</th><th align="center">different</th><th align="center">1<sup>st</sup></th><th align="center">2<sup>nd</sup></th><th align="center">3<sup>rd</sup></th><th align="center">4<sup>th</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">KEGG</td><td align="center">1012</td><td align="center">844 (83.4%)</td><td align="center">34 (3.4%)</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">27</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MetaCyc</td><td align="center">148</td><td align="center">134 (90.5%)</td><td align="center">8 (5.4%)</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SGD</td><td align="center">504</td><td align="center">419 (83.1%)</td><td align="center">32 (6.3%)</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">22</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Swiss-Prot</td><td align="center">1055</td><td align="center">1024 (97.1%)</td><td align="center">27 (2.6%)</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">23</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Moreover, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref> shows the level of agreement when functional annotations for 12 species established by KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and FUNGIpath are compared. Strikingly, the average number of specific ID-EC predictions is larger in FUNGIpath (1,551) than in KEGG (879) and their distribution is unexpected. Only 647 (38%) are strictly identical and 30 more are nearly identical, mostly differing only at the level of the last EC number digit, suggesting that we predicted the right reaction but the substrate is uncertain [Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>]. Four times more predictions are specific to FUNGIpath (48%) than to KEGG (12%). This result is probably not due to any overprediction effect. Indeed, many enzyme predictions have been curated manually in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and in this case the results are fairly close (15% for KEGG against 26% for FUNGIpath). Moreover, the corresponding figures for Swiss-Prot and FUNGIpath are 17.6% and 13.7%, respectively [Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>]. To check whether there is any correlation, we plotted the genome size and the number of sequences with enzymatic annotations predicted respectively by FUNGIpath and KEGG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We obtained a better correlation for the FUNGIpath data (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.28), and the slope of the tendency curve was positive with the FUNGIpath predictions but negative with the KEGG predictions. Thus, there seems to be no strong methodological bias that could explain why the predictions of FUNGIpath are generally far better than those of KEGG and close to those of the well-curated Swiss-Prot database. In fact, we observed that a significant number of the Swiss-Prot-specific IDs have no orthologs in other genomes, explaining why they are not detected in FUNGIpath. Thus, the high number of specific FUNGIpath predictions obtained is probably due to neither under-prediction by KEGG nor over-representation by FUNGIpath. Indeed, the average numbers of proteins that are annotated for an enzymatic reaction in KEGG and FUNGIpath are quite close (respectively 9.5 and 13.5% [Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>]). The main reason for the better performance of FUNGIpath is probably our choice to work only with complete EC numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], allowing a significant portion of the incomplete KEGG EC numbers to be recovered. For instance, 92 (25%) of the 388 incomplete EC numbers in KEGG have been completed in FUNGIpath. This enrichment by FUNGIpath is illustrated by comparing the information given by the different databases for the KEGG reference pathway 'terpenoid biosynthesis' (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). When the level of pathway conservation is compared among the FUNGIpath, KEGG and Swiss-Prot predictions, we observe that this level is globally lowest with the Swiss-Prot data and higher in KEGG, but the highest conservation is obtained with FUNGIpath. These differences can be explained by the better annotation of fungal genomes in FUNGIpath.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation between genome size and number of proteins annotated with a four-digit EC number</bold>.

For instance, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows that acylamide amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.4) is very well conserved in fungi and is involved in at least six different pathways in both the KEGG and MetaCyc databases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Since this activity is used in so many pathways of both primary and secondary metabolisms, it is not surprising to find this EC number in ten distinct groups of orthologous proteins ranging in size from 4 to 25 members (data not shown).

Thus, the KEGG reference pathway 'biotin metabolism' (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>) appears to be incomplete in many fungi, since several of its specific enzyme activities (EC 2.3.1.47, 3.5.1.12, 6.2.1.14, 6.2.1.11 and 6.3.3.3) are not found. We may suppose that either these EC numbers exist in the fungi but are not currently detectable, or the fungi use other enzyme activities to catalyse these reactions (see below). Moreover, the further steps in biotinylation catalyzed by the ligases EC 6.3.4.9, 6.3.4.10, 6.3.4.11, and 6.3.4.15 are fully conserved in all the main taxonomic groups of fungi.</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref> further shows that most of the EC numbers (blue text) correspond to proteins that have no EC number assignment in Swiss-Prot but have been annotated in FUNGIpath by orthology prediction.

Some EC numbers are missing from only one fungal group: this seems to be the case for EC 5.3.3.2, which is absent in the Taphrinomycotina group. Note, however, that this group is represented by only one species, namely <italic>S. pombe</italic>.

More recently, BRH was found to give results comparable to the more sophisticated methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], but it is limited to finding only a single hit among the multiple possible links between paralogs.</p><p>We therefore preferred to use several different approaches simultaneously, three based on sequence similarity and one on phylogeny, to obtain robust results. Since the overlap between the outputs of these four methods is very narrow (a result underlining how conflicting these orthology methods are), we enriched the data found in the intersection of the different methods with a HMM approach. This allowed us to obtain fairly coherent sets of reliable orthologs forming well-defined groups that are of adequate size (the largest containing only 297 sequences) and biologically relevant.</p></sec><sec><title>Using reliable orthologs to improve functional annotation</title><p>The second requirement for exploiting these orthology data to predict metabolic pathways in fungal species that have never been studied experimentally was to assign a functional annotation to each group of orthologous proteins. To do that, a correspondence was established between a group and an EC number, defining an enzyme catalyzing a specific step in a known pathway included in the KEGG and MetaCyc databases. Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> show how group(s) of orthologs responsible(s) for a specific enzyme can be found and how this EC number is distributed in the different genomes. <italic>Inter alia</italic>, the multiple sequence alignment and the deduced phylogenetic tree can be obtained for each family of orthologs and inparalogs encoding this EC number in the fungi compared. We have provided evidence that FUNGIpath is a reliable tool for annotating enzyme function in an automatically predicted group of orthologous proteins. It gives data that are either comparable to those of the independently curated public databases or, in many cases, better (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). At any rate, most of the differences appear to be limited to the fourth digit, corresponding mainly to the nature of the substrates of the enzymes compared.</p><p>FUNGIpath is also useful for finding the set of orthologs that constitutes an entire pathway. This allows us to determine whether all the steps of the pathway have been predicted and, if so, in how many of the genomes compared that pathway is complete. Indeed, one of the main problems encountered in trying to reconstruct entire pathways from orthology data is the occurrence of missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] such as pathway holes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The absence of an EC number (orphan metabolic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]) may be due to a low percentage identity of the corresponding amino acid sequence or to its replacement with another protein. Alternatively, the simultaneous absence of several EC numbers that belong to a specific pathway would suggest that the entire pathway is absent from the species concerned. This is the case, for instance, in the later steps in the KEGG reference pathway 'terpenoid biosynthesis', where the last three EC numbers are missing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). However, it is possible that this absence may simply be due to a major annotation problem or to the replacement of this pathway with an alternate, undetected, one.</p><p>Overall, FUNGIpath appears to be a useful and innovative tool for helping to resolve some artifactual pathway holes. For instance, it is unique in annotating a group of orthologs found in six species as EC 4.2.3.9 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), aristolochene synthase. No such amino acid sequences are predicted in Swiss-Prot, KEGG or MetaCyc, but the presence of aristolochene synthase has been demonstrated experimentally in two fungi not included in FUNGIpath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], supporting our prediction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>FUNGIpath appears to be a reliable tool for the analysis of fungal metabolism. It will be especially useful for annotating newly-sequenced genomes of poorly-studied organisms.</p><p>Moreover, it allows the respective metabolisms of various taxa to be compared easily. For instance, 101 EC numbers are found uniquely in ascomycetes (data not shown) and may help to delineate the metabolic specificities of the last common ancestor of this group.</p><p>As more and more genomes are expected to be decrypted in the near future, tools such as FUNGIpath will be very useful for the progressive reconstruction of primary and secondary metabolisms in the ancestors of the main branches of the present-day fungal tree and for elucidating the evolution of various specific derived metabolisms. FUNGIpath will be updated regularly (at least twice a year) with newly published fungal genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability and requirements</title><p>The database is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fungipath.u-psud.fr">http://www.fungipath.u-psud.fr</ext-link>.
