The isothia analogues induced cytotoxicity of HCT116 in a time-dependent manner and inhibited the clonogenic survival of HCT116 and NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner comparable to the standard anti-cancer drug camptothecin. Herein employing flow cytometry, we demonstrate that isothiacalothrixin B analogues inhibited proliferation of colon cancer cells by the arrest of cells in S and G2/M phases over a period of 48 hours at a concentration of 5 &#x003bc;M. Our results also suggest that the cytotoxicity of thia analogues of calothrixin B is partially mediated by induction of cellular DNA strand breaks. The UV-Vis spectroscopic studies with CT-DNA revealed groove binding for calothrixin B and its thia analogues wherein subsequent <italic>in silico</italic> molecular modelling studies indicated preferential binding to the AT-rich regions of minor groove of DNA. Furthermore, thiacalothrixin B caused transcriptional activation of p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> promoter and upregulation of its protein levels independent of p53. The induction of DNA damage response pathway leads to apoptosis in isothiacalothrixin B but not in thiacalothrixin B treated cells. The isothia analogues <bold>SCAB 4</bold> induced DNA strand breaks and cell cycle arrest even after treatment for a short period (i.e., 4 hours) and the cell cycle effects were irreversible. For the first time, this study provides detailed cellular effects on the potential use of isothiacalothrixin B analogues as cytotoxic agents.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by UPE-Phase II (C3/UPE-Phase II/ Theme A/ 2013/ 338) grant, India.

Although calothrixin B is less potent than its N-oxide bearing calothrixin A, an attempt to introduce fluorine substituent to the E-ring of calothrixin B resulted in 3-fluoro calothrixin B having superior cytotoxic profile comparable to calothrixin A [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One useful approach of modulating the anticancer property involves the replacement of aromatic heterocyclic framework with the sulphur-containing heterocyclic unit which results in a change of regiochemical features such as size, shape and electron donating ability to assist proper fit of the ligand within the drug target [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The presence of sulfur atom in many experimental and clinically approved drugs have been widely reported in the literature where the low-lying C-S &#x003c3;* orbitals in sulphur heterocyclics induce a positive electrostatic potential to favour non-bonding interactions with the biological targets [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202903.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Earlier studies with isothiaellipticine, the sulphur isostere of the pyridocarbazole alkaloid ellipticine is capable of restoring p53 function in a manner analogous to ellipticine, the parent compound [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Also, the replacement of carbazole nitrogen (NH) with sulphur atom resulted in thia calothrixin B [<bold>SCAB 1</bold>] having a cytotoxic property inferior to calothrixin B, however upon its isomerisation yielded isothiacalothrixin B [<bold>SCAB 4</bold>] having superior anti-cancer potency in cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The synthesis of isosteric analogues of calothrixn B is beneficial both in search of more active yet specific cytotoxic compounds and helps in explaining the mode of action of these compounds on cancer cell lines. In this report, we evaluated the cytotoxic potential of thia analogues of calothrixin B [<bold>SCAB 1&#x02013;12</bold>] in HCT116 (colon cancer cells) and explored the possible mechanism of cell killing by these analogues. The results from our studies suggest that isothiacalothrixin analogues caused apoptotic cell death in HCT116 cells through induction of irreversible DNA damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>A detailed procedure on the preparation of calothrixin B and its sulphur analogues [<bold>SCAB 1&#x02013;12</bold>], their characterization data (IR, NMR, MS and HRMS spectral analysis) were discussed in our earlier reports [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202903.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

There was a significant increase in the amount of linear form following treatment with thiacalothrixins, the doubly substituted (both A and E ring substituted isothiacalothrixins) analogues; there was a more significant increase in the linear form (&#x0003e; 65%). It was evident that the isothiacalothrixins have more ability to induce strand cleavage of supercoiled plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202903.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). An interesting observation to note with the isothiacalothrixin <bold>SCAB 4</bold> was a reduction in the band intensities of both linear and supercoiled form indicating that this analogue might possess nuclease activity which results in degradation of plasmid DNA even in the absence of reducing agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202903.g006">Fig 6</xref>, lane 4).</p><fig id="pone.0202903.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0202903.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Thiacalothrixin B and its analogues cleaved plasmid DNA in a cell-free system.</title><p>Supercoiled plasmid DNA was incubated for 1 hour with 250 &#x003bc;M of thiacalothrixin B analogues, 200 &#x003bc;M of ferric chloride in the presence or absence of DTT (200 &#x003bc;M).

Thus, the nature of the chosen oligomer conformation dramatically affects the docking performance when the ligand interacts with DNA through an induced fit [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There are two kinds of non-covalent interaction between the drug and the DNA, namely groove recognition (minor or major groove) or intercalation between the base pairs [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In general, most of the small molecules prefer to bind to the minor groove although the major groove offers a larger and shallow binding pocket with the more H-bonding donor as well as acceptor sites. The planar aromatic molecules such as ellipticine prefer an intercalative binding wherein structural changes to DNA (unwinding and lengthening) happens and is contemplated as an induced fit mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In our molecular modelling studies minor groove recognition by calothrixin and its thia analogues have made a fit, like a lock- and key- mechanism. Due to their flexibility, the isothiacalothrixin derivatives like <bold>SCAB 4</bold>, <bold>6, 10</bold> and <bold>12</bold>, assume a curved shape that matches DNA topology and allows a comfortable fit of the ligand in the minor groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202903.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Different binding poses of calothrixins and its analogues and their residual interactions between base pairs of DNA (PDB ID: 453D [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) have been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202903.g008">Fig 8</xref>. Main factors which govern this type of interaction depends upon factors viz., van der Waals contacts playing pivotal role reinforced by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Moreover, the selective binding mechanism of the calothrixins and its thia analogues to AT-rich sequences in the minor groove, indicate that it is possible to achieve sequence-selective binding agents. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202903.g008">Fig 8</xref>, for instance, analogues like <bold>SCAB 4</bold>, <bold>6</bold> &#x00026; <bold>SCAB 10</bold> did interact strongly with AT-rich sequences, displaying large residence times.

The cell cycle analysis following four-hour treatment of calothrixin B or thiacalothrixin B resulted in cells reviving to normalcy within 24 hours of growth in drug-free medium whereas arrest of cells in S-G2/M phase were seen until 96 hours after drug removal in the case of isothiacalothrixin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202903.g013">Fig 13A and 13B</xref>).

Thus, considering calothrixin B as a useful lead compound to discover novel chemotherapeutic agents, the sulphur isostere analogues of calothrixin B were synthesised [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our preliminary study of the anticancer spectrum of thia analogues of calothrixin B in various cell lines, identified isothiacalothrixins are having potent anti-tumour activities [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similar studies with ellipticine, an anti-tumour alkaloid structurally related to calothrixin B identified thiaellipticine to be equally active and in contrary isoellipticine was inactive [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] whereas the isothiaellipticine was found to be effective as that of ellipticine. However, several 7-substituted isoellipticines and isoellipticinium salts showed promising anti-cancer activity in NCI-60 screening and inhibition of human topoisomerase II activity [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The cellular effects of 7-hydroxyisoellipticine on the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) cell line, MV4-11 demonstrated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent activation of DNA damage pathway to result in the arrest of cells in G2/M phase and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Also, another isoellipticine derivative, 7-formyl-10-methylisoellipticine induced ROS mediated cytotoxicity in AML cells and significant reduction of tumour burden in an AML xenograft mouse model [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although isothiacalothrixin has been reported to inhibit cancer cell growth in sub-micromolar concentrations, no information concerning the mode of cell killing has been reported. Thus, this study is the first to demonstrate the cellular effects of thia calothrixin B and its isomer isothiacalothrixin B in HCT116 and NCI-H460, a colon and lung cancer cell lines, respectively. The <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity assay across six cell lines showed that isothiacalothrixin B analogues were superior in inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells in comparison to thiacalothrixin B, which itself was less active than the parent analogue, calothrixin B. Also, treatment with 5&#x003bc;M of isothiacalothrixin B analogues to HCT116 cells showed time-dependent increase in dead cells which is not prominent upon similar treatment with thiacalothrixin B. Furthermore, a clonogenic assay was performed to assess the long-term growth effects of thia analogues of calothrixin B. The clonogenic assay which has proven predictive value in chemosensitivity test of cytotoxic compounds, correlated well with the results from SRB assay. Our results demonstrate a concentration-dependent inhibition of clonogenicity in isothiacalothrixin B treated HCT116 and NCI-H460 cells, suggesting that isothiacalothrixins have a therapeutic potential against the colon and lung cancer.</p><p>One of the common mechanisms by which the anti-tumour agents exerts its effect is through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It has been reported that fluoro analogue of calothrixin B could cause the arrest of cells in the G1-S phase of cell cycle and apoptosis in HCT116 cells [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We analysed the cell cycle effects of thiacalothrixin B in the presence of the mitotic inhibitor, nocodazole to ascertain the truly affected population of cells in the cell cycle. Treatment for 16 hours with nocodazole alone resulted in 70% of the cells progressed across the cell cycle and arrested in G2/M phase. However, administration of isothiacalothrixins little prior (4 hours) to nocodazole resulted in a decrease in the percentage of cells that reached G2/M phase. This reduction in G2/M cells was due to arrest of cells in the G1-S phase of cell cycle whereas thiacalothrixin B treatment to HCT116 cells caused the intermittent G1 arrest of cells which progressed through the cell cycle to get arrested in G2/M phase because of nocodazole treatment. The results from cell cycle analysis indicate the important sign of damage to the cellular DNA following treatment with isothiacalothrixin B but not with thiacalothrixin B which led to the permanent arrest of cells in G1-S phase.</p><p>Literature evidence suggests that DNA damage following treatment with cytotoxic agents results in the arrest of cells in S or later in G2/M phase, thus allowing time for the cells to repair damaged DNA [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202903.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We first demonstrated the ability of isothiacalothrixin B analogues to induce plasmid DNA strand breaks in the presence of metal ion and a reducing agent, dithiothreitol. At the cellular level COMET assay has become one of the most commonly used methods for studying DNA damage [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To check for DNA strand breaks, single- cell gel electrophoresis assay (COMET assay) was performed. The results showed that there was a significant DNA strand break in isothiacalothrixin treated HCT116 cells which was evident from the appearance of comet tails and increase in percentage tail DNA. However, the extent of comet tailing was not prominent among the thiacalothrixin B treated cells. Thus, an underlying mechanism of isothiacalothrixin B induced S, G2/M arrest in HCT116 cells seems to be closely associated with its effect on the integrity of DNA.</p><p>There are two major modes of drug binding to DNA which include either intercalation between adjacent base pairs and interaction into the minor and major groove. Significant deformation of the DNA to create a binding cavity is required for intercalation whereas minor groove does not require major changes in DNA conformation [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We have previously reported that the absence of quinone unit in calothrixin B as in the case of quinocarbazloes favoured intercalation with DNA [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>In silico</italic> studies with quinone containing calothrixin B or its thia analogues indicated minor groove binding to the DNA with higher affinity to AT-rich sequences which was confirmed through UV-Vis spectral studies. The overall shape of the isothiacalothrixins resembles that of typical minor groove binders where the presence of quinone unit favours hydrogen bonding interaction with the AT-rich regions of the DNA. It might also be possible that calothrixins in general target AT-rich regions of the DNA sequence and therefore inhibit transcription and expression of specific genes.</p><p>Interestingly, the sustained antiproliferative effect of thiacalothrixins was not dependent on p53 as some of the cell lines tested (HeLa, SiHa, MDA-MB231 and U251) lack functional p53. This has prompted us to examine the role of p53 if any, on the relevant aspects of the thiacalothrixin B induced DNA damage response of HCT116 cells (which has functionally active p53). The p53 pathway often gets activated following DNA damage leading to arrest of cells in G1 or G2/M phase [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> is thought to be an effector for p53-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation in response to DNA damage [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Western blot analysis was employed to investigate the protein levels of p53 and p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> following treatment with thiacalothrixin analogues. As expected, upregulation of p53 protein level was not seen with any of the calothrixin analogues taken for the study, whereas the positive control camptothecin, a DNA damaging drug-induced p53 levels. Surprisingly, the p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> protein levels were elevated following treatment with thiacalothrixin B and its parent analogue calothrixin B but not with the isothiacalothrixin analogues. Thus, taking in to account on the DNA damage induced by isothiacalothrixin B and subsequent arrest of cells in G1 and G2/M phase, without an increase in the protein levels of p53 strongly support the notion that the induction of cell death is p53- independent. Several studies have highlighted the p53-independent induction of cell death following DNA damage mediated through the pro-apoptotic p73 [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202903.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or NF-kB (nuclear factor-kB) [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202903.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] or by the degradation of anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and thus it is possible that isothiacalothrixin B analogues caused cell death through any of these mechanisms. Both the thiacalothrixin B and calothrixin B induced accumulation of p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> protein. Studies with full length and deletion mutant p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> luciferase reporter indicated a significant activation of full-length (-2300/8+) and the plasmid construct lacking p53-binding sites (-300/+8), apparently suggesting the transcriptional activation of p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> by thiacalothrixin/calothrixin B was independent of p53 function. Further, the minimal p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> promoter required by thiacalothrixin B is similar to the region modulated by Ras, highlighting the possible involvement of HRAS&#x02014;MAPK-ERK due to the activation of stress response as suggested for paclitaxel [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and cisplatin [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Following the induction of damage to cellular DNA, a major response is cell death due to apoptosis. Thus, induction of apoptosis as a possible outcome of DNA damage has been widely cited in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0202903.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A morphological study with AO-EB double staining identified early, and late phases of apoptosis in isothiacalothrixin treated cells which also showed signs of nuclear condensation. Further, DNA fragmentation was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that isothiacalothrixin B induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, to study the ability of HCT116 cells to repair calothrixin induced DNA damage, a challenge assay was performed. The cells were treated with calothrixins for a short period to induce DNA damage and allowed to recover in drug-free media. The cell cycle analysis at different time points in the recovery period indicated that isothiacalothrixins maintained arrest of cells until 96 hours in G1 and G2/M phases while thiacalothrixin B or calothrixin B treated cells have normal cell cycle distribution. Similarly, comet assay at 48 hours during the recovery period too showed the appearance of comet tails in isothiacalothrixin treated cells but not with thiacalothrixin B treatment indicating that the former analogues caused irreparable DNA damage to HCT116 cells. The above result clearly suggests that the integrity of DNA is severely compromised immediately after treatment with <bold>SCAB 4</bold> which eventually leads to cell cycle arrest in S-G2/M phases which is maintained for a longer period and failure to repair damaged DNA, ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death in HCT116 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec035"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study recommends that isothiacalothrixin B analogues be considered as a potent DNA damaging agent that caused apoptosis in HCT116 cell line. Given the fact that p53 is frequently mutated in tumours, isothiacalothrixin analogues whose cell killing was independent of p53 function could be a suitable clinical candidate for anti-cancer therapy. The isothiacalothrixin analogues inhibited the clonogenicity and caused strong arrest of cells in S, G2/M phases of cell cycle in HCT116 cell line. Further, these analogues readily cleaved plasmid DNA in the presence of a reductant and caused DNA strand breaks in HCT116 cells leading to cell death through apoptosis. Also, this study identified p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> as a mediator of cellular sensitivity to thiacalothrixin B or calothrixin B. Apart from showing preference of DNA binding to AT-rich regions; the present study also provides the basis for irreparable DNA damage as a mechanism of isothiacalothrixin induced apoptosis making these analogues as promising anti-cancer agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202903.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Isothiacalothrixins inhibited the cell viability of HCT116 cells over an extended period.</title><p>Cell viability at various time points as assessed by Trypan blue staining of HCT-116 cells following treatment with different calothrixin analogues (5 &#x003bc;M) and camptothecin (0.5 &#x003bc;M). <bold>SCAB 1</bold> (solid black square), <bold>SCAB 4</bold> (solid red circle), <bold>SCAB 6</bold> (solid green triangle), <bold>SCAB 10</bold> (solid inverted magenta triangle), camptothecin (solid cyan diamond).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0202903.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202903.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Clonogenic survival curves of HCT-116 and NCI-H460 cells.</title><p>Attached cells were treated with 0.1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M of calothrixin B, thiacalothrixin B and isothiacalothrixins (<bold>SCAB 4</bold>, <bold>6</bold> and <bold>10</bold>), for 48 hours.
