We performed microarray analysis of healthy individuals and patients with NTNBC and with TNBC. Interestingly, microarray data showed that 41 lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed among the 3 study groups. Of these, 19 lncRNAs were downregulated and 22 lncRNAs were upregulated in patients with TNBC compared with those in patients with NTNBC and healthy individuals (fold change, &#x02265;1.5, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Among the upregulated lncRNAs, only 3 lncRNAs, namely, <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic>, showed apparent difference in expression between patients with TNBC and NTNBC, thus prompting us to explore their potential for differentiating between these BC subtypes. Expression level of these 3 lncRNAs was determined in plasma samples of 60 patients with BC and 40 healthy individuals by performing real-time PCR. As expected, the relative expression of <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic> was significantly higher in patients with TNBC than in patients with NTNBC (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.01 for all), which was consistent with the results of microarray analysis. Moreover, statistically significant difference was observed in the relative expression of these lncRNAs between patients with TNBC and healthy individuals. However, the expression level of <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> was higher in patients with NTNBC than in healthy individuals (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.01; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B), which was inconsistent with the results of microarray analysis. The expression level of ANRIL and UCA1 showed no difference between NTNBC patients and healthy individuals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and C). This discrepancy may be because of false-negative results obtained by performing microarray analysis. Because its ability to differentiate between TNBC and NTNBC, the Spearman correlation test was performed to determine the correlation between the expression levels of these lncRNAs in the plasma and in BC tissues. Results of Pearson correlation test showed that <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> expression in the plasma was positively correlated with its tissue levels (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.6702, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0002). However, this relationship was not observed for <italic>ANRIL</italic> and <italic>UCA1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of these 3 lncRNAs was compared with various clinical parameters.

However, few studies focused the expression of lncRNAs associated with TNBC in blood samples.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Recent studies have suggested that some lncRNAs are present in serum, plasma, and other bodily fluids in a stable form protected from endogenous RNases, which makes them suitable markers for the noninvasive analysis of patient samples.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The present study focused on the deregulated expression of lncRNAs in the plasma samples of patients with BC to establish them as novel noninvasive biomarkers for differentiating between TNBC and NTNBC. We performed microarray analysis to determine lncRNA profiles and identified 41 aberrantly expressed lncRNAs. Of these, only <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic> were upregulated in patients with TNBC compared with NTNBC, which was validated further by performing real-time PCR. However, only <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> expression in the plasma was significantly correlated with its level in BC tissues; moreover, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> showed differential expression in patients with NTNBC and healthy individuals. Nonetheless, research concerning lncRNAs as biomarkers for BC is still in its infancy.</p><p>Thus far, <italic>ANRIL</italic> upregulation is considered the primary feature of many carcinomas, including BC.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Lin et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> found that <italic>ANRIL</italic> expression was higher in nonsmall cell lung cancer tissues than adjacent nontumor tissues and was associated with high TNM stage and advanced lymph node metastasis. Similarly, <italic>ANRIL</italic> expression was higher in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues than in adjacent tumor-free tissues, and patients with high <italic>ANRIL</italic> expression showed significantly poor overall survival.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> In addition, <italic>ANRIL</italic> overexpression in patients with serous ovarian cancer was associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. An in vitro study suggested that <italic>ANRIL</italic> plays an important role in regulating cell migration/invasion by regulating Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (MET) and Matrix Metalloproteinase-3 in serous ovarian cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Studies have also shown that <italic>ANRIL</italic> knockdown significantly inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of gastric cancer cells<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> and thyroid cancer cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Importantly, Royds et al<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> investigated rs11515 single nucleotide polymorphism in breast tumors and suggested that this polymorphism was more frequent and was associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype because of increased <italic>ANRIL</italic> and decreased <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4a</italic></sup> expression. A recent study measured mRNA levels of the gene encoding <italic>ANRIL</italic> in 456 breast carcinomas tissues and found that <italic>ANRIL</italic> mRNA expression was higher in breast carcinomas tissues than in normal breast tissues, which was exclusively and weakly correlated with ER and PR status and showed a complex association with epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition markers.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> We determined <italic>ANRIL</italic> expression in the plasma of patients with BC and found that its expression was surprisingly higher in patients with TNBC than in patients with NTNBC. These findings prompted us to determine the diagnostic value of <italic>ANRIL</italic> in TNBC, which has not been performed to date. We also obtained similar results for <italic>HIF1A-AS</italic> and <italic>UCA1</italic>. The antisense long noncoding RNA hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha antisense RNA-2 (<italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>), which was located in chromosome 14q23.2, was reported overexpressed in several tumor tissues, such as chronic myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma,<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> but the studies about the exact significance of <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> ware limited. Antisense lncRNA <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> is highly expressed in gastric cancer, and its expression is correlated with TNM stage, tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis and knockdown of HIF1A-AS2 expression by siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> In addition, a recent study determined the tumor suppressor function of <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> in glioblastoma multiforme<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> and similarly, researchers suggested that silencing <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> could lead to cell proliferation inhibition, cell migration suppression, and apoptosis induction in bladder cancer cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> To our knowledge, no study has explored the function of <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> in BC to date. The present study is the first to investigate <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> expression in patients with TNBC and NTNBC. ROC analysis generated a relatively satisfied diagnostic value of <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> for TNBC. Urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (<italic>UCA1</italic>) is a new lncRNA-encoding gene belonging to human endogenous Retrovirus-H family and was originally identified in bladder transitional cell carcinoma. Because <italic>UCA1</italic> is highly expressed in bladder transitional cell carcinoma, it was suggested as a biomarker for diagnosing bladder cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Zheng et al<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> detected <italic>UCA1</italic> expression in 112 pairs of tumorous and adjacent normal tissues of patients with gastric cancer and found that high <italic>UCA1</italic> expression was correlated with poor differentiation, tumor size, invasion depth, TNM stage, and poor overall survival. Similarly, <italic>UCA1</italic> expression was upregulated in BC tissues, indicating that <italic>UCA1</italic> plays an oncogenic role in BC both in vitro and in vivo.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> One study found that <italic>UCA1</italic> promoted the invasiveness of BC cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> Another study showed that endogenous <italic>UCA1</italic> knockdown significantly reduced the number of invading cells, suggesting that <italic>UCA1</italic> upregulation increased the invasiveness of BC cells by activating Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Li et al<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> investigated the expression level of <italic>UCA1</italic> in acquired tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells and argued that downregulation of <italic>UCA1</italic> could enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen resistance directly interact with miR-143. In contrast, Lee et al<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> suggest that special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 is the upstream regulator of <italic>UCA1</italic> expression and depletion of <italic>UCA1</italic> could suppress tumor growth and cell survival of breast cancer cells. Consistently, we found that <italic>UCA1</italic> expression was upregulated in the plasma of patients with TNBC compared with that in healthy individuals. Based on this finding, we performed ROC analysis to assess the diagnostic values of the 3 lncRNAs. We found that the 3 lncRNAs had good diagnostic ability to differentiate between patients with TNBC and healthy individuals. Moreover, we explored the diagnostic value of these lncRNAs for distinguishing between TNBC and NTNBC. ROC analysis showed that the AUC values of <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic> were 0.785 (0.660&#x02013;0.881), 0.739 (0.610&#x02013;0.844), and 0.817 (0.696&#x02013;0.905), respectively. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that plasma levels of <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic> were risk factors for TNBC after adjusting for other parameters (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Next, we constructed a regression equation (TNBCSigLnc-3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;10.25 + 1.07&#x000d7;<italic>ANRIL</italic> + 0.53&#x000d7;<italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> + 0.65&#x000d7;<italic>UAC1</italic>) based on these 3 lncRNAs. The AUC value of TNBCSigLnc-3 was 0.934 (0.839&#x02013;0.982), which was superior to that of <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic> alone. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that plasma lncRNAs <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic> have excellent diagnostic value for TNBC.</p><p>However, this study has a limitation. On one hand, as a pilot study, we explored the diagnostic value of lncRNAs in a small cohort and did not confirm our findings in another group with a larger number of subjects. On the other hand, as time limited, we did not systematically evaluate their predictive value for prognosis or response to chemotherapy in patients with TNBC, which would have provided useful alternatives for personalized treatment of this heterogeneous malignancy. We will focus on these aspects in our future studies.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our results expand the findings of previous studies regarding the role of lncRNAs in BC, especially TNBC, and show that the expression of circulating lncRNAs is deregulated in BC. Our data indicate the ideal diagnostic value of lncRNAs <italic>ANRIL</italic>, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic>, and <italic>UCA1</italic> to differentiate between patients with TNBC and NTNBC. Because of the high diagnostic value of combined lncRNA analyses in the present study, we anticipate that lncRNA analyses will have great potential in characterizing circulating markers for TNBC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: <italic>ANRIL</italic> = antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus, AUC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, BC = breast cancer, <italic>HIF1A-AS2</italic> = hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha antisense RNA-2, lncRNAs = long noncoding RNAs, NTNBC = non-triple-negative breast cancer, TNBC = triple-negative breast cancer, <italic>UCA1</italic> = urothelial carcinoma-associated 1.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>
