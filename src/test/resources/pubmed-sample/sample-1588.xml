The bacteria asymptomatically colonize the upper respiratory tract, with a prevalence of carriage ranging from 10 to 35% [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, meningococci occasionally cross the epithelial mucosa and blood-brain barrier, causing life-threatening septicemia and meningitis [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Meningococcal adhesion to the epithelium in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for colonization and pathogenicity [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and this process can be divided into two steps. The initial interaction with cells is characterized by proliferation and adhesion as aggregates, called microcolonies. This stage is followed by the detachment of individual bacteria from the microcolonies, enabling relocation to new colonization sites or intimate adhesion to the cells in a single bacterial layer. Dispersal from microcolonies enables the meningococci to invade the mucosa and enter the circulation [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The process of neisserial autoaggregation is highly dynamic and driven by interactions between type IV pili (Tfp). Tfp are one of the most multifaceted prokaryotic virulence factors mediating adhesion, autoaggregation, DNA uptake, biofilm formation, and twitching motility (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). The dynamics of aggregation have been shown to be affected by several factors, including the minor pilin PilX, PilW and recently characterized polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The abundance of Tfp has also been shown to be critical for aggregation [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition to the amount of pili present on the surface of the bacterium, post-translational modifications of the major pilin subunit PilE have been shown to affect aggregation and dispersal. These modifications include O-linked glycosylation and addition of phosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine, or phosphoglycerol moieties [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The induction of PilE phosphoglycerol transferase B (PptB) and increased phosphoglycerol moieties on PilE favor the dissociation of pili bundles and subsequent microcolony dispersal [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent study showed that neisserial microcolony stability was affected by the oxygen concentration. Depletion of oxygen resulted in a loss of proton motive force (PMF), which affected the pilus-pilus interaction and led to a subsequent detachment of bacteria from microcolonies in liquid [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although several factors have been shown to contribute to detachment of bacteria from microcolonies, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of host cell-derived molecules in microcolony dispersal. Bacterial pathogens can sense host signaling molecules to acquire information about the host physiological status and alter virulence properties accordingly to adapt to distinct niches. In the gut, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 (EHEC) sensing of ethanolamine, a source of carbon and nitrogen, and the sugar fucose can play an important role in regulating virulence genes involved in colonization. This mechanism occurs independently of metabolic utilization of the nutrients by the bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> can utilize ethanolamine signaling to modulate metabolism and virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> responds to a component present in human saliva, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HPA), by altering gene regulation of the adhesins <italic>nadA</italic> and <italic>mafA</italic>, as well as metabolic pathways; 4HPA binds directly to and inhibits the activity of the FarR regulator [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This compound is a catabolite of aromatic amino acid metabolism, but it is unclear whether 4HPA is from the host cells or microbiota [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that accumulation of a host cell-derived molecule, identified as lactate, is capable of inducing a rapid synchronized dispersal of meningococcal microcolonies. The dispersal was not dependent on the utilization of lactate by the bacterium. Additionally, the dispersal was independent of the previously reported mechanisms of microcolony dispersal mediated through depletion of the proton motive force. Altogether, our findings suggest that host-derived lactate plays an important role as a signaling molecule that mediates microcolony dispersal in pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The dispersal of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> microcolonies is synchronized and accelerated in the presence of live host cells</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the process of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> microcolony dispersal.

(B) In low lactate concentrations, pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> remain in microcolonies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1006251.g009"/></fig><p>To survive and proliferate within the host, bacteria must be able to sense and respond to changes in the environment. Many pathogens are known to respond to nutrient availability in the environment to regulate virulence-related gene expression (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). Several studies have highlighted the importance of energy metabolism for meningococcal colonization [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. <italic>Neisseria</italic> is restricted to glucose, pyruvate and lactate as carbon sources [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While the concentrations of pyruvate generally are low, glucose and/or lactate are present in the tissues colonized by <italic>Neisseria</italic>. During normal conditions, L-lactate is the dominant isoform found, but D-lactate can also be present as a result of fermentation from bacteria such as lactobacilli [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Lactate is the major carbon source on mucosal surfaces where lactic acid bacteria colonize, and the concentration of lactate in nasopharyngeal tissue can be higher than 1 mM [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Lactate is also present at high concentrations in the female genital tract colonized by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>gonorrhoeae</italic>, where it can go up to more than 6 mM. In the bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid, glucose serves as the major carbon source, although the lactate concentration can be higher than 1 mM [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Lactate and pyruvate predominate as carbon sources within phagocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our results showed that both lactate isoforms were able to induce microcolony dispersal at 0.4 mM. This is within the range of physiological concentrations encountered by pathogenic <italic>Neisseria in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> metabolize and grow faster in the presence of lactate, receiving nutritional signals from the environment during favorable growth conditions and detaching from microcolonies could be a survival strategy.</p><p>Our results showed that lactate induces microcolony dispersal independent of the presence of the bacterial LDH that oxidizes it. These results show that the observed effect is not due to the previously characterized burst in respiration and growth after lactate addition in the presence of glucose [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is also supported by the observation that pyruvate did not induce dispersal but promoted growth in a similar manner to lactate. These results indicate that the previously described mechanism of neisserial microcolony dispersal triggered by oxygen depletion and subsequent membrane depolarization is not the mechanism in this case [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To test this, we measured the concentration of ATP and the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH during dispersal. We did not observe any decrease in either the ATP concentration or the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in the dispersed bacteria, suggesting that no dramatic decrease in the PMF occurred during the process.</p><p>In the absence of lactate the dispersal phase lasted for several hours. However, when the gene encoding for the lactate permease (<italic>lctP</italic>), required for lactate uptake, was deleted we observed accelerated dispersal even in absence of lactate. This result suggests a role for LctP as a negative regulator of microcolony dispersal since deletion of the <italic>lctP</italic> resulted in microcolony dispersal. It is worthwhile to mention that lactate permease has been shown to function in a PMF-dependent manner in bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Disruption of the PMF may therefore affect microcolony dispersal, as shown by Dewenter <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], indirectly by a change in lactate permease activity. However, there is also a possibility that the absence of LctP can affect lactate export and lead to accumulation of intracellular lactate produced by the bacterium and cause dispersal.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>lctP</italic> in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> has previously been shown to attenuate nasopharyngeal colonization despite for increased initial adherence to host cells. It has also been shown to affect the ability to cause bloodstream infection and cause an increase in sensitivity to complement-mediated killing [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The incompetence to acquire and utilize nutrients, like lactate, important for growth plays a crucial role in colonization. Since microcolony dispersal seems to be a highly regulated in pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic>, deregulation of the process like we have observed with the &#x00394;<italic>lctP</italic> mutant, could also affect the ability of the bacteria to colonize in efficient way.</p><p>Although lactate is able to induce microcolony dispersal, we cannot exclude the possibility that other host derived factors present in the CM and <italic>in vivo</italic> might have the same stimulatory effect as lactate. However, collection of CM from host cells grown in absence of glucose, and thus inhibited in their ability to produce and secrete lactate, significantly reduced the stimulatory activity.</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that meningococci bound to epithelial cells modulate their gene expression, enabling them to form intimate contacts with the cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, we did not detect any upregulation of the transcription regulator <italic>misR</italic> or the MisR/S-regulated genes <italic>pptB</italic>, <italic>pilC1</italic> and <italic>crgA</italic> after inducing dispersal with CM. One possible explanation is that meningococci respond differently when interacting with cells than when they are treated with CM. However, our results from the infection assays using different cell confluences and the adhesion-deficient &#x00394;<italic>pilC1</italic> mutant showed that direct contact with cells is not essential for the timing of the dispersal phase or for its short time span. Additionally, our qPCR analysis included genes important for meningococcal piliation and pilus aggregative properties (<italic>pilC1</italic>, <italic>pilC2</italic>, <italic>pilE</italic>, <italic>pilT</italic>, <italic>pilX</italic>, <italic>pilV</italic> and <italic>pilW</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We did observe significant changes in their mRNA levels upon induction with CM. However, when we analyzed the protein level of PilE, PilT, PilC, PilX and PilW we did not detect any changes.</p><p>Post-translational modifications of the PilE subunit can also modulate Tfp function. Tfp of <italic>Neisseria</italic> can be further grouped into class I and class II pili. In majority of our study we used the meningococcal C strain FAM20 that is known to express class II pili. Recent findings by Gault <italic>et al</italic> indicate that class II pili can contain up to 5 glycosylation sites and deletions of glycosylation genes in these strains affect adhesion, aggregation and successful pilus assembly. The multiple glycosylation sites are suggested as a way to avoid immune recognition as class II pilus expressing strains lack the ability to vary the antigenicity of the pilus fiber [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. By using two additional strains, meningococcal W-135 strain JB515 and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11, we observed that lactate induced dispersion occurs in both class I and class II pilus expressing strains. Although no upregulation was observed in <italic>pptB</italic> expression and no changes were observed in the expression of genes involved in glycosylation modifications we cannot exclude that post-translational modifications play a role in response to CM and lactate stimulation. Moreover, PilE can also be modulated by phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The absence of these modifications has been shown to affect pilus bundling but no changes in functionality have been observed [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the work presented here demonstrates that lactate, secreted from host cells, can stimulate the dispersal of microcolonies in pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic>. The metabolic utilization of lactate by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> was not required for induction of rapid dispersal. In the future, it would be interesting to identify adhesive and general properties of dispersed bacteria upon interaction with lactate. This study provides a basis for future research to further investigate the role of lactate as a signaling molecule influencing disease progression in pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> FAM20 serogroup C strain and mutant deficient in PilC1 have been described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006251.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].
