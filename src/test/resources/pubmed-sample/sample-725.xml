Diagnosis-related-groups (DRGs) is tested as a useful tool to save medical costs and increase hospital efficiency through decreasing avoidable health services and improving productivity (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Meanwhile some evidence also indicated it might compromise the quality of care (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Owing to its superiority in bending the upward cost curve and releasing the government&#x02019;s financial pressure, this payment method has been adopted worldwide to reshape hospitals&#x02019; funding mechanisms (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>In 2009, the Chinese government announced to reform its hospital payment mechanism from the retrospective cost-based systems to prospective DRG-based system, with the aim of providing its population with affordable health services (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In 2011, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued a reference list of 104 diagnoses/procedures to guide local governments&#x02019; DRG pilots (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). And in 2017, this list expanded to 320(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Against this background, many local governments had initiated different kinds of DRG payment pilots (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). 20 of the 32 provinces in mainland China had implemented some kinds of DRGs till 2016(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, most of these payment reform models were still in its infancy and piloted in a partial health system (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These halfway reforms made it difficult to identify the comprehensive effect of the payment reform arrangements in a whole health system (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Zhongshan, a city in the southeast of China, pro-actively adopted an innovative DRG system together with global budget to pay for its inpatient services in all public hospitals since July 1, 2010.</p><sec><title>Hospital Payment System Reform In Zhongshan</title><p>Zhongshan established its social health insurance scheme in 1999. At the beginning, fee-for-service (FFS) was adopted to pay for all health care, which resulted in a rapid increase in hospital expenditures in the following three years. In 2002, the local health insurance administration department explored a special capitation-like retrospective payment method to replace the FFS system and formally carried out in 2004. Under this system, all the insured inpatients were reimbursed depends on their insurance claimed expenses. The middle 95 percent cases were reimbursed through the capitation-like system for the same fixed price, regardless of their diagnoses, comorbidities, or services actually used. The rest highest and lowest 2.5 percent cases were reimbursed through the original FFS approach.</p><p>However, a rapid growth in health volumes and inpatient expenses was observed during 2004 to 2009. The inpatient visits had increased by 52 percent during this period, nearly tripled the average provincial level of 19 percent for the same period. And the fiscal deficit ratio of the insurance fund reached to 35.6 percent in 2009. Additionally, due to the great variation of care costs among different cases, this kind of payment system caused frequent conflicts between the insurance management department and the hospital directors.</p><p>To address the above problems, Zhongshan pro-actively launched its hospital payment reform combining DRGs with global budget in 2010. Under the new system, all inpatient cases were classified into different payment groups based on two factors: 1) patients&#x02019; primary diagnoses, which were identified by the ICD-10 code (International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> revision); and 2) procedure information. There were four basic procedure categories: medical treatment, traditional operations, minimally invasive surgery and interventional therapy. Through this approach, each payment group is defined with a diagnostic group together with a specific procedure category. A total of 4630 DRGs was included in the latest version of the DRG system in Zhongshan, with a cost weight assigned to each DRG. The cost weight reflects the average claimed expense of patient care compared with other DRGs. The payment rate for a specific DRG was calculated as its cost weight multiplied by the base payment rate. The base payment rate equals the overall budget available for the DRG payment system (approximately 73 percent of the social insurance expenditures) divided by the total weights of all DRGs in the same period. It&#x02019;s the same for all DRGs during a certain period (usually a fiscal year). The base payment rate was determined at the end of the fiscal year and the final reimbursement amount was calculated for each hospital.</p><p>Zhongshan payment reform was unique in three aspects. First, it is a comprehensive reform project that implemented in the whole local health system. Patients reimbursed through the new system accounted for 98 percent of all the insured cases. Second, besides the diagnosis factor, procedure factor was considered for patient classification. Patients were classified into different groups more reasonably and acceptable for practice. The last but most important, the DRG payment rates in Zhongshan were determined flexibly with global budget, which were set to control both system and individual expenditures. Actually the global budget and DRG-based payment are the two main methods that are piloting in China. But they are implemented separately to contain hospital-level and individual-level expenses in most places. In this circumstance, it&#x02019;s hard to give full play to their strengths in paying for inpatient services. Zhongshan innovatively merged the two payment methods into one composite payment system and united the patient&#x02019;s cost containment with hospital cost containment.</p><p>The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the hospital payment reform in Zhongshan on patient&#x02019;s resource use and care quality. Although there&#x02019;ve been abundant empirical studies of the evaluations of DRG-based payment method, China&#x02019;s health system is different from other countries, which shares various provider incentive mechanisms(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The payment model in Zhongshan provided us a rather good example to understand how this payment method affects the physicians&#x02019; behaviors and health outcomes in China&#x02019;s health scenario before it is generalized in the whole country.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sites and Sampling</title><p>A retrospective cohort study among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from 2008 to 2014 was designed. Two general tertiary hospitals were selected as our study sites. They were the largest local hospitals and treated over 80 percent of all AMI patients in the city. In 2014, 62 percent of all admitted patients and 69 percent of the total inpatient revenues in the two sites were paid through the new DRG-based system.</p><p>The disease of AMI has been widely used to evaluate physician&#x02019;s response to the policy change (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Hospital treatment of AMI patients includes three approaches: 1) drug therapy; 2) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); and 3) coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Treatment expenditures vary greatly, with drug therapy being the lowest and CABG the highest. PCI is the primary choice for treating AMI because of its superior clinical effects (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>In order to study provider&#x02019;s behavior change before and after the payment reform in 2010, we just focused on patients who received drug therapy or PCI during hospitalization. CABG was excluded in our study because of its too small sample size (15 cases, accounts for 0.44% of the total sample population) and not feasible for statistical analysis. So the inclusion criteria for our study population were:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1) The primary diagnosis was AMI (ICD-10 code: I21.0-I21.4, I21.9);</p></list-item><list-item><p>2) Patients admitted to the study hospitals between Jan. 2008 and Dec. 2014;</p></list-item><list-item><p>3) Patients received drug treatment or PCI procedure during hospitalization.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Prior to the payment reform, hospitals received a flat payment for treating the insured AMI patients, no matter what procedure they received. After the reform, the weights of patients receiving drug therapy rank from 152 to 222, with an average weight of 203; and of patients receiving PCI rank from 502 to 969, with an average weight of 796. The reimbursement price for PCI group is nearly quadrupled the drug group. In this case, physicians would be motivated to provide appropriate treatment for AMI patients. We chose the indicators of the percentage of PCI use and total hospital expenses per admission to measure the impact on patient&#x02019;s resource use after the reform, and the indicators of in-hospital mortality and re-admission rate within 30 days after discharge to evaluate the impact on quality of care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data Collection and Statistical Analysis</title><p>Hospital electronic medical record (EMR) data of AMI patients in the two study hospitals were employed. Information collected included patients&#x02019; demographic characteristics, principal diagnosis, admitted and discharged dates and departments, length of stay (LOS), procedure performed, status at discharge, and total hospital expenses. The new DRG based payment system was adopted on July 1, 2010. In our study, patients discharged from Jan. 2008 to Jun. 2010 were considered as the pre-reform period; and from Jul. 2010 to Dec. 2014 the post-reform period. A total of 2895 inpatients were included as our study sample, among which 727 were discharged before the reform and 2168 afterwards.</p><p>Fifty one percent of the population in Zhongshan were migrant workers. The social insurance programs in China are city-level managed. The migrants&#x02019; medical reimbursement affairs are not charged by the place they work but by where they are from. Given that, patients with insurance scheme in Zhongshan were regarded as the intervention group in our analysis, while patients not covered were as the control group. We assumed the two groups had similar consumer behaviors since their medical costs could be reimbursed by their local social insurance schemes finally.</p><p>Difference-in-difference (DID) methodology was used to evaluate the net policy effect (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).

Our study investigated the impacts of the innovative DRG-based payment with global budget in Zhongshan. The results suggested it had a positive effect on AMI patient&#x02019;s cost containment but negative effect on encouraging resource use. The new payment method had no significant impacts on patients&#x02019; care quality.</p><p>As mentioned before, PCI was a major procedure for treating the disease of AMI. Our results showed an incredible increase of over 60 percent in PCI use for both two groups after reform. This huge increase is mainly attributable to the technology progress of cardiac interventional therapy in China. The past decade had witnessed a fast increase of PCI use in this country, with an annual growth rate of 16 percent. It is reported that the number of PCI cases in China in 2017 was 1.1 million, which was nearly 5 times than that in 2009 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Nevertheless, our DID results revealed a significant decrease in PCI use for the intervention group. A potential explanation is that the physicians&#x02019; intention to gain profit through providing PCI service to the insured had diminished after reform.</p><p>Coincidently, we found a considerable decrease of total hospital expenses for the insured patients in our study. This result was consistent with our study in Shanghai (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and studies in other countries (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). But some studies found the opposite results of increasing costs after DRG was implemented (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The effect of DRG payment system on containing costs per discharge is mixed. More evidence is needed for China in the further to monitor its effects.</p><p>Additionally, we observed a remarkable increase in hospital costs for the uninsured patients. The similar result was observed in another study in Shanghai DRG payment reform (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) but not observed in Beijing reform (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The cost shifting consequence from the insured to the uninsured under the DRG-based payment system should be noted in future payment mechanism design.</p><p>Our study suggested no significant changes in AMI patients&#x02019; hospital mortality or readmission rate within 30 days for both two groups after reform. Literatures about quality evaluations of DRG-based hospital payment reform found confounded results in quality evaluation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Besides, how to explain the mechanism of hospital payment reform on patient&#x02019;s quality outcomes remains unclear. More studies in this area are of vital importance for both researchers and policy makers in China.</p><p>After years of pilots, the State Council announced to adopt the DRG-based prospective system to replace the current retrospective payment system in all public health facilities in 2020 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This paper was a case study of comparing the DRG-based budget payment with a unique capitation-like payment in China. As we all know, fee-for-service is the prevailing method to pay for hospitals in this country and has been discussed a lot (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, there also exist some other payment methods in local practices. For example, among 18 cities in Guangdong province where we studied, 13 of them adopted the capitation-like payment. So case studies of comparing the DRG payment with various kinds of existing payment methods are necessary to provide evidence for the governments&#x02019; policy making. Also, China will provide rich experiences to share with other countries.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Limitations of the study and directions for future study</title><p>There were several limitations in this paper. First, only AMI patients were included in our study. Physicians&#x02019; responses to hospital payment change may vary among different DRGs. If possible, samples of other DRGs, especially the surgical DRGs, should be used for further investigation. Second, some of the patient&#x02019;s social demographic factors were missed, which might cause bias in the regression analysis. Lastly, if possible, the analysis from the provider&#x02019;s perspective could be conducted to provide more evidence of how the payment policy change affect physician&#x02019;s behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DRG-based payment with global budget in Zhongshan demonstrated a positive effect on AMI patient&#x02019;s cost containment but negative effect on promoting resource use. No evidence was observed of the payment reform with patient&#x02019;s quality of care. However, cost-shifting to the un-insured should be paid attention in payment reform implementation in China. More evidence of the impacts of the DRG-based payment in different regions is needed before it is generalized.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues (Including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc.) have been completely observed by the authors.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of Interests</bold></p><p>The authors declared no conflict of interests in this study.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security Social Insurance Center for their assistance with the field survey.
