Its limited specificity demands using a second (triage) test to better identify women at high-risk of cervical disease. Cytology represents the immediate triage but its low sensitivity might hamper HPV testing sensitivity, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where cytology performance has been suboptimal. The ESTAMPA (EStudio multic&#x000e9;ntrico de TAMizaje y triaje de c&#x000e1;ncer de cuello uterino con pruebas del virus del PApiloma humano; Spanish acronym) study will: (1) evaluate the performance of different triage techniques to detect cervical precancer and (2) inform on how to implement HPV-based screening programmes in LMIC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Women aged 30&#x02013;64 years are screened with HPV testing and Pap across 12 study centres in Latin America. Screened positives have colposcopy with biopsy and treatment of lesions. Women with no evident disease are recalled 18 months later for another HPV test; those HPV-positive undergo colposcopy with biopsy and treatment as needed. Biological specimens are collected in different visits for triage testing, which is not used for clinical management. The study outcome is histological high-grade squamous intraepithelial or worse lesions (HSIL+) under the lower anogenital squamous terminology. About 50&#x02009;000 women will be screened and 500 HSIL+ cases detected (at initial and 18 months screening). Performance measures (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) of triage techniques to detect HSIL+ will be estimated and compared with adjustment by age and study centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), of the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and by those in each participating centre. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to monitor progress of the study, assure participant safety, advice on scientific conduct and analysis and suggest protocol improvements. Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="NCT01881659">NCT01881659</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>preventive medicine</kwd><kwd>colposcopy</kwd><kwd>risk management</kwd><kwd>molecular diagnostics</kwd><kwd>public health</kwd><kwd>gynaecological oncology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pan American Health Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>WHO/Reproductive Human Research Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006090</institution-id><institution>Center for Global Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001707</institution-id><institution>Union for International Cancer Control</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitation of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study design in which additional samples from all women screened with HPV and cytology are collected at screening simulating a reflex-testing scheme whenever possible, will allow the evaluation of triage techniques without influencing the outcome of the study, as tests are performed or evaluated after disease confirmation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is the largest cervical screening study in Latin America with more than 500 histologically confirmed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) expected that will permit evaluation of several triage tests, alone or in combination, for HPV-positive women.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A large number of women are being screened with HPV testing in Latin America, where the majority of women would not otherwise benefit from high-quality cervical screening.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The multicentric nature of the study will allow capturing experiences from areas which are geographically, culturally and socio-economically distinct from each other and with different health systems/areas that may face common challenges but that require different approaches in accordance with their context.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Colposcopy and collection of biopsies was not performed in HPV-negative women (only in a subset who had abnormal cytology), potentially introducing verification bias when assessing absolute performance measures of screening tests to be used in primary screening; however, the study design will allow unbiased evaluation of triage tests.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>More than 500&#x02009;000 new cases and nearly 300&#x02009;000 deaths of cervical cancer occur every year, more than 90% in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Cytology-based screening programmes have reduced cervical cancer in high-income countries (HICs) but, with few exceptions, not in LMICs. Programmes using cervical cytology are complex and the method has limited sensitivity and low reproducibility, imposing the need for repeated tests, resulting in high cost and logistic complications which hamper programme implementation and success.</p><p>It is now clear that a group of about 12 human papillomavirus (HPV) types are the causal agents of cervical cancer and that HPV16 and HPV18 are responsible for about 70% of tumours. HPV is a very common infection usually acquired shortly after initiation of sexual activity, but most infections are cleared by the immune system within 2&#x02009;years of acquisition and only a few persist and progress to cancer.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Highly effective and safe vaccines against HPV16 and HPV18 have been developed<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and vaccination programmes are being rolled-out around the world, but the full public health impact of the vaccine is expected only after several decades. Cervical cancer screening programmes remain high priority, especially for LMIC and constitute one of the main interventions to achieve elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem.</p><p>Currently, there are several tests for HPV detection with high sensitivity and reproducibility that can detect more cervical disease at an earlier stage and offer long-term reassurance of low risk of cervical precancer and cancer. These tests are now being used or considered to replace cervical cytology in primary screening as they allow extension of the screening interval, with consequent savings that can compensate the possibly higher cost of the test compared with cytology. In addition, HPV testing can be done on self-collected samples, increasing screening uptake.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, emerging point-of-care tests giving immediate results can improve treatment rates.</p><p>Screening with HPV has the problem that transient HPV infections are very common, particularly among young women, where the majority of infectious will regress spontaneously. Even among women over 30 years of age, HPV infection tends to regress and only in a fraction of women with persistent infection, it can lead to true cancer precursors and cervical cancer. Thus, one main issue to resolve is which tests or strategies can better select HPV-positive women, who are most likely to have or develop the significance disease (triage) in the near future, for further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Here we detail the design of a multicentric study that aims to evaluate visual methods, cytology-based and novel molecular-based techniques that can be used to triage women who test positive for HPV and that can lead to the establishment of HPV-based efficient, affordable and sustainable screening programmes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The aims of the study are: (1) to investigate the performance of emerging cervical cancer screening and triage techniques among women 30 years and older and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of different approaches for implementation of organised HPV-based screening programmes.</p><p>The primary objective is to estimate performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value) of multiple techniques alone or in combination for detection of histologically confirmed cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse lesions (HSIL+) under the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) among HPV-positive women 30&#x02013;64 years old.</p><p>Secondary objectives are: (1) similar performance analyses among all recruited women and restricted to those with negative cytology; (2) estimations of colposcopy referral, overdiagnosis and overtreatment rates by a single technique or a combination of techniques; (3) establishment of a biological specimens&#x02019; bank with an associated database to evaluate future cervical cancer screening and triage techniques; and (4) assessment of the feasibility of implementing organised HPV-based screening programmes within local health systems. The methodology to assess this objective will be reported separately.</p><p>The key hypotheses of the study are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cervical cancer screening by HPV testing followed by triage with one or more additional tests identifies the majority of women at high risk of having precancerous cervical lesions who need treatment to prevent cervical cancer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The number of screened women lost to follow-up in the screening process (receiving screening results, attending diagnostic workup, receiving adequate treatment) could be reduced if: (1) women are well informed of the process and trust the healthcare system, (2) healthcare professionals are well trained and ready to offer care and (3) the follow-up is centrally organised with capacity to contact screenees.</p></list-item><list-item><p>HPV-based cervical cancer screening could be implemented in Latin America if a screening platform is developed, and affordability and sustainability of the screening programme can be guaranteed ahead of implementation.</p></list-item></list><p>The study is being conducted in 12 study centres in Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.</p><p>Recruitment started in May 2013 and will be completed in December 2020. However, as the study includes a follow-up visit after 18 months of initial screening, final completion of the study is envisaged for July 2022.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Candidate triage techniques for HPV-positive women</title><p>Different tests and approaches will be evaluated for triage of HPV-positive women. Some of them may also be evaluated as stand-alone without triage test: one with enough sensitivity to be used for primary screening but good specificity so that no triage is required.</p><p>The alternatives for triaging HPV-positive women include visual methods, cytology, high-risk and type-specific HPV persistence, HPV genotyping, HPV oncoproteins and other novel molecular biomarkers.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Visual methods</title><p>Visual inspection of the cervix after the application of 5% acetic acid (VIA) is inexpensive, simple and can be carried out by primary care personnel (nurses, midwives, general doctors). The sensitivity and specificity of VIA are limited and highly dependent on training and experience of examiners, who require continued training and supervision.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> VIA results are highly heterogeneous, expressing lack of consistency in human judgement.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The performance of the test decreases with increasing age due to the regression of the transformation zone into the endocervix in women older than 50 years;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> however, a recent study showed that VIA might have uniform sensitivity across age groups.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>VIA may be used as triage of HPV-positive women in remote areas where high-tech methods for diagnosis may not be available, identifying who can be treated with ablative treatment, who should be referred to a higher healthcare level and who can be followed up without treatment.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Current WHO guidelines recommend this as one of the possible screening strategies.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In this study, VIA will be standardised to allow evaluation of whether a lesion is present or not and if the observer considers that the subject would be a candidate for immediate ablative treatment, but VIA results will not be used for clinical management except when cancer is suspected and the woman should be immediately referred to colposcopy. Visual inspection after the application of iodine lugol, the other naked-eye visual method, will be evaluated in some study centres under a different protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Cytology</title><p>Conventional cytology or Pap has been used since the 1950s in primary screening and has succeeded in decreasing cervical cancer in several HICs, particularly where women have had cytology frequently and high adherence to diagnosis and treatment has been achieved. This has not happened in LMIC, where usually coverage has been low and access to diagnosis and treatment has been limited.</p><p>Liquid-based cytology (LBC) uses the same principles and criteria of Pap and is replacing Pap in HICs because it offers the opportunity for reflex testing and significantly reduces the number of inadequate samples,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> although in terms of screening performance both are comparable.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> More recently, computer-scanned liquid-based slide algorithms showed promising results by improving detection of HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3)/women with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>HPV testing followed by triage with cytology (Pap or LBC) is the immediate screening modality to be used in HPV-based screening settings with high cytology capacity. However, the limited sensitivity of cytology might detriment HPV testing sensitivity, especially in places where strict quality assurance cannot be ensured.</p><p>It has been postulated that prior knowledge of HPV status may improve the performance of cytology since the interpreter will be more meticulous when reading a smear of an HPV-positive woman. However, results from studies have not been fully consistent; some have shown increases in the proportion of abnormal results<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> leading to increased CIN grade 2 or worse lesions (CIN2+) detection<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and potential reduction of immediate referrals to colposcopy,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> while at least one study reported losses in cytology accuracy with increases of false-positive readings and losses in specificity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> We plan to evaluate the performance of cytology, both Pap and LBC, with and without prior knowledge of HPV status, as triage tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>HPV persistence as a triage strategy</title><p>It has been proposed to use 1&#x02009;year HPV persistence (overall or type-specific) to follow HPV-positive/cytology-negative women in places where cotesting is recommended like in USA or after using cytology for triage of HPV-positive women, like in Argentina.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> Within an HPV-based screening programme where cytology will not be available, a repeat HPV test could also be used to define clinical management. We plan to evaluate the performance of HPV persistence as triage of HPV-positive women, both among all HPV positives and restricted to those with negative cytology. For this purpose, we will use two time HPV testing points: 1&#x02013;3 months at colposcopy and 18&#x02009;months after initial screening among untreated women.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>HPV genotyping</title><p>Stratifying women on the presence of HPV16 and HPV18, which are responsible for about 70% of cervical cancer and their precursors, will identify women at the highest risk of CIN3 or worse lesions (CIN3+). In a large cohort study in the USA, among women older than 30 years, the 18&#x02009;year cumulative incidence of CIN3+ among one-time HPV16-positive women was 8.5% compared with 3.1% for other oncogenic HPV-positive women negative for HPV16,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> indicating that women positive for HPV16 (and possibly HPV18) should be referred to colposcopy immediately while other HPV-positive women could be recalled later maintaining adequate sensitivity.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Some of the HPV screening tests already provide separate results on HPV16 and/or HPV18, and we will evaluate the performance of HPV16 and HPV18 among HPV-positive women who will be screened with the COBAS HPV test (Roche) in some study centres.</p><p>Additionally, the potential to improve the accuracy of HPV testing and triage with different combinations of HPV types is under evaluation,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> and we also envision to carry out full HPV genotyping of all women in the study cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>HPV oncoproteins</title><p>E6 and E7 oncoproteins are the main effectors of the HPV oncogenic activity. The molecular structure, functions and expression levels are different between oncogenic and non-oncogenic HPV types.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> E6 is expressed at elevated levels in cervical cells only when HPV-infected cervical cells undergo precancerous or cancerous changes.</p><p>An HPV E6 strip test, the OncoE6 Cervical Test targeting E6 HPV16 and HPV18 (previously Advantage HPV E6 test, targeting E6 HPV 16, 18 and 45) has been used in studies around the world with promising results.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;33</xref> In a study in Honduras, the sensitivity of the test to detect precancer related to HPV16/18 infections was 96.8% (95 % CI 83.8% to 99.8%) and 56.4% (95% CI 43.3% to 68.6%) regardless of HPV type, and the specificity was 97.5% (95% CI 93.7% to 99.0%). All but one subject with histological HSIL tested positive for E6, and the test was negative in all cases associated with HPV types other than 16 and 18 or in HPV negatives.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A new E6/E7 prototype adding oncoproteins for HPV types 31, 33, 35, 45, 52 and 58 has been developed with the aim of increasing overall sensitivity of the method. Initial evaluation of its performance to detect CIN3 +has been carried out by our group. Results were promising and the prototype is under refinement for further clinical evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-6"><title>Markers of HPV-induced cell regulation alterations</title><p>Another important biomarker under intensive study is <italic>p</italic>16<sup>ink4a</sup>, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor markedly overexpressed in cancerous and precancerous cervical tissue. It corresponds to a cellular correlate of increased expression of the viral E7 oncoprotein that disrupts the retinoblastoma protein (<italic>p</italic>Rb) pathway, leading to compensatory overexpression of <italic>p</italic>16<sup>ink4a</sup>.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The cellular accumulation of <italic>p</italic>16<sup>ink4a</sup> can be measured using ELISA and by immunostaining of histology and cytology slides as done by the CINtec test (Roche, before mtm laboratories).</p><p>A meta-analysis of the performance of this test,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> indicated that the proportion of smears overexpressing <italic>p</italic>16<sup>ink4a</sup> clearly increased with severity of cytological (12% normal, 89% HSIL) and histological (2% normal, 82% CIN3) abnormalities. The authors noted limited reproducibility due to insufficient standardised interpretation of the immunostaining. One study comparing Pap, HPV testing and HPV triaged with <italic>p</italic>16<sup>ink4a</sup> found that the latter scheme maintains the sensitivity gained by the HPV test but with a referral rate to colposcopy similar to that of a Pap-based programme.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Another biomarker of the cell cycle is Ki-67 which is a proliferation marker. As described, E7 leads to accumulation of <italic>p</italic>16 but also commits the cell into proliferation which leads to overexpression of Ki-67. Since overexpression of <italic>p</italic>16 (tumour suppression protein) and Ki-67 (proliferation marker) are mutually exclusive under normal conditions, the detection of overexpression of both simultaneously by dual-immunostaining could identify cells with deregulated cell cycle. This dual-staining test can substantially simplify and standardise the evaluation of stained slides.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In a recent study, dual-staining showed better risk stratification, requiring substantially fewer colposcopies for CIN3 +detection compared with Pap, suggesting that it can safely replace Pap as triage of HPV positives.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-1-7"><title>Methylation</title><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically transmitted epigenetic motif that reflects molecular events in host cells contributing under certain conditions to cervical carcinogenesis. It can be quantitated with good accuracy in exfoliated cells and could be applied directly to the residual sample after HPV test.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Several human genes have consistently shown elevated methylation in cervical precancer, highlighting the potential role of methylation for triage of HPV-positive women.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> Additionally, aberrant methylation of certain HPV genes including L1 and L2 are also associated with precancer, especially for types HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33 and HPV45.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> A recent study showed that increased methylation of L1/L2 sites in all 12 high-risk HPV types was positively associated with CIN3/AIS suggesting the role of methylation in marking the transition from infection with high-risk HPV to precancer. In coming years, it is expected that several HPV DNA methylation assays that could serve as triage for HPV-positive women will be developed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Women are invited to screening using different approaches, such as: door-to-door census of the recruitment area, invitation by community leaders or media campaigns.</p><p>Women eligible for inclusion are those aged 30&#x02013;64 years and residents of a specified catchment area, mentally competent to understand the consent form, able to communicate with study personnel and physically able to have a pelvic exam.

The participation of pregnant women and those who have given birth less than 3&#x02009;months before screening are deferred until they are 3&#x02009;months or more postpartum or up to the end of the enrolment period. Similarly, women with heavy vaginal bleeding or severe cervical infection are deferred until the condition is resolved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a screening study in which HPV testing and Pap will be carried out in up to 50&#x02009;000 women aged 30&#x02013;64 years in multiple centres across Latin America.

Next, after inserting a speculum without lubricant, the clinician collects cervical cells in the following order: (1) a Dacron swab that will be placed in a cryovial without preservation medium and frozen within 24&#x02009;hours of collection; and (2) two consecutive collection brushes; the first brush is used to prepare a Pap smear and then washed in a vial with PreservCyt (Hologic) medium (PC); the second one is directly washed in a second PC vial.

This sample is used for a new HPV test and to perform other tests which could not be performed on the enrolment sample due to insufficient sample volume.</p><p>In some centres, after cervical sampling and immediately before colposcopy, a trained nurse, midwife or a doctor performs VIA. After application of 5% acetic acid, the clinician records the presence of acetowhite areas and documents his/her assessment on the need for treatment.

About 50&#x02009;000 women in the region will be screened, many of those for the first time, with a highly sensitive HPV test with efforts concentrated on treating all women with detected HSIL+.</p><p>The study will contribute to establish the clinical management of HPV-positive women under different scenarios, those where high-tech molecular biomarkers can be used as triage and those where low-tech VIA may be the only suitable triage test.</p><p>The introduction of HPV testing in primary screening is imminent in the region. In fact, Argentina and Mexico have been offering HPV screening for several years within the public health system. In the other countries, HPV testing is available in the private sector and is slowly becoming available or there are plans to introduce it at reduced cost in public systems. Clinical guidelines on how to follow-up HPV-positive women are under development, and the use of cytology as triage as done in HIC need to be proven acceptable in Latin America, where cytology has demonstrated to have very low sensitivity and attempts to organise cytology-based screening programmes have largely failed. More sensitive and affordable triage tests to be used in Latin America are awaited, the study will contribute with evaluating the most promising ones.</p><p>A few limitations of the study design should be mentioned. First, capacity (personnel and facilities) differences among study centres could influence results. To prevent this, special attention is given to training health professionals involved in the study: clinicians collecting samples, colposcopists, pathologists, molecular biologists among others. The training includes good clinical practices, research governance and up-to-date specialty training to standardise procedures all over the study. Second, we are not performing colposcopy nor collecting biopsies in HPV-negative women, potentially introducing verification bias for evaluation of techniques in primary screening but not in triage. However, as cotesting with Pap is being done, and although the rate of cytological abnormalities among HPV-negative women will be usually low, we will have a small group of them having colposcopy helping us to estimate disease among HPV negatives. We also do not collect random biopsies at colposcopy when acetowhite lesions are not evident, thus, it is possible that some lesions are being missed. To minimise missing lesions, the study protocol includes: (1) 2&#x02013;3 biopsies of any acetowhite areas observed are collected at colposcopy with ranking of severity of biopsies collected to further evaluate the use of multiple and severity of biopsy collection; and (2) a second round screening at 18 months for women with no evident disease at initial screening, providing an additional opportunity of detecting any missed disease at initial screening.</p><p>The main strengths of our study are: (1) the design will allow the evaluation of a series of triage techniques without influencing the outcome of the study, as tests are performed/evaluated usually after cervical disease status of HPV-positive have been determined; (2) the sample size will allow the evaluation of multiple combinations of techniques and to adjust for centres heterogeneity when needed; (3) the study is centrally coordinated by IARC with participation of 12 study centres, each of them with strong expertise in different cervical screening aspects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5</xref>) and opportunity has been given to junior investigators to participate in training and monitoring missions, thus, contributing to promote new cancer research Latin American leaders and to consolidate a large network of screening professionals; and (4) the multicentric nature of the study will also allow capturing experiences from areas which are geographically, culturally and socio-economically distinct from each other and with different health systems/areas that may face common challenges but that require different approaches in accordance with their context.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>ESTAMPA study network.

Thus, the study will substantially contribute to further scale-up of HPV testing as recommended by Pan American Health Organization by developing a &#x02018;screening platform&#x02019; for implementation of HPV-based cervical screening programmes in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d36e1192"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2019-035796.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d36e1193"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2019-035796.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Deceased:</bold> Dr Paula Gonzalez deceased on 26 March 2020</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MA, RM, GIS, PG, AF, MAP, CW, ACV, ELP, JJ, CF and RH conceptualised the study.
