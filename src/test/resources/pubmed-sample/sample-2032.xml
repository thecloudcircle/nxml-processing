process, it is essential to treat bone defects to improve
regeneration and reconstruction (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Bone
tissue engineering is a new and promising treatment
for bone injuries caused by infections, tumors,
trauma and abnormal skeletal developments
(<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Stem cells are noted for their potential for
self-renewal and differentiation into various lineages
with specific functions. In particular, their
potential to give rise to mature and functional osteoblast-
like cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> has attracted
many scientists interested in their application as
the live part of bone implants (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a commonly
used source in regenerative medicine and tissue
engineering. They have unusual and useful properties
such as: the potential for intense regeneration,
immunosuppressive features, and a high level of plasticity. There are different sources for deriving
MSCs, like bone marrow and adipose tissue. For
many years, bone marrow derived MSCs (BMMSCs)
were the unique source of autologous stem
cells for tissue engineering, but nowadays it has
been suggested that they be replaced by adipose
tissue derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The main
reason is the increased simplicity of harvesting fat
compared to bone marrow aspiration. In addition,
the yield of stem cells from adipose tissue is higher
than that from bone marrow (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It has been
shown that the typical MSC yield for bone marrow
is between 1 in 50,000 and 1 in 1 million in
a skeletally mature adult and for adipose tissue is
between 1 in 30 and 1 in 1,000 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Other reasons
are the low level of cell morbidity during the
extraction process and the simple equipment and
conditions required for the isolation and growth of
AT-MSCs (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Takahashi et al. generated induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via the transduction
of murine and human fibroblasts using only
four transcription factors; Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc,
and Klf4 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These cells were very similar
to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in characteristics
such as morphology, gene expression, proliferation,
epigenetic status of pluripotent cellspecific
genes and telomerase activity. Today,
advances in iPSC research have modified the
prospect for tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine. Several studies have reported the
potential application of iPSCs in the treatment
of various diseases (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Many studies have compared the proliferation
and differentiation characteristics of human ATMSCs
with those of BM-MSCs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and a
few studies have compared human MSCs with
unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) isolated
from umbilical cord blood (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). There have
been many reports on the potential of AT-MSCs
(<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and recently, we ourselves demonstrated
the high proliferation and osteogenic differentiation
potential of human iPSCs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However,
as yet, there are no analyses which compare the
osteogenic differentiation potential of human
iPSCs with AT-MSCs. Therefore, in the present
study, AT-MSCs were isolated, characterized
and compared with human iPSCs based on their
biological behavior and their capacity for differentiation
into osteoblastic lineage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><sec><title>Isolation and expansion of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal

adipose tissue samples were collected
during liposuction operations from five donors

after informed consent according to guidelines of
the Medical Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health
I. R. Iran. These samples were then were treated
with 0.2% collagenase II under intermittent shaking
at 37&#x002da;C for 30 minutes. After centrifugation
(1200 RPM for 15 minutes), the supernatant was
discarded and the cell pellet was treated with RBC
lysis buffer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at room
temperature (RT) for 5 minutes. Samples were
then centrifuged at 1200 RPM for 5 minutes and
the cell pellet was resuspended in a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> culture

in 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x002da;C. After reaching
confluence (about 80-85%) over ten days the cells
were detached using trypsin (2 minutes in 37&#x002da;C,
5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and replated.</p></sec><sec><title>Expansion of induced pluripotent stem cells</title><p>Human Fibroblast iPSC lines were obtained
from the cell bank (Stem Cells Technology Research

were expanded according to the protocol reported
in a recent study (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In brief, the cells
were maintained on feeder layers of SNL76/7
cells treated with mitomycin-C (Invitrogen Co.,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Human iPSC medium
consisted of DMEM/F12 culture medium supplemented
with 15% knockout serum replacement
(KSR) (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA,
USA), 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 1
mmol/L L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen Co.,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.1 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma, Munich, Germany), penicillin/
streptomycin (Sigma, Munich, Germany) and 4
ng/mL of human fibroblast growth factor 2 (Invitrogen
Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA), and about
60% of the medium was replaced every day.
Every four to five days human iPSC colonies were detached with 0.1% Collagenase IV, and
replated onto inactivated SNL76/7 for expansion.</p></sec><sec><title>MTT assay</title><p>
AT-MSCs at passage 2 (P2) and human iPSCs
were seeded with an initial cell density of 5000
cells/well in 24-well tissue culture polystyrene
(TCPS) plates and were cultured for five days.
The proliferation of these cells was evaluated
via MTT assay. Thus on each day, 50 &#x003bc;L of
MTT solution (5 mg/mL in DMEM) was added
to each well (n=4), to evaluate the conversion of
MTT to formazan crystals by the mitochondrial
dehydrogenases of the living cells. The plate
was incubated at 37&#x002da;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 3.5 hour
incubation the supernatant was removed to examine
the dissolution of the dark-blue intracellular
formazan, and 250 &#x003bc;L dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) as an appropriate solvent was added.
The optical density was read at a wavelength of
570 nm in a micro-plate reader (ELx-800, BIOTEK
instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).</p><p>For osteo-lineage differentiation, the cells
were cultured in osteogenesis medium containing
basal medium (DMEM + FBS 10%) supplemented
with 10 nM dexamethasone, 0.2
mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, and 10 mM
&#x003b2;-glycerophosphate (all from sigma, Munich,
Germany). The medium was changed every 2
days. Finally, at day 21 of culture in inductive
medium the cells were stained with alizarin red
S to assess mineralization.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>After two weeks of culture, the expression of
surface markers was evaluated using monoclonal
antibodies including Fluorescent isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human
CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), Phycoerythrin
(PE)-conjugated CD105 (Endoglin or
SH2) CD34, and CD90. The cells were detached
with trypsin/EDTA and incubated with the specific
antibodies or isotype control antibodies
(FITC-or PE-labeled antibodies were included
in each experiment) in 100 &#x003bc;L of 3% bovine serum
albumin in PBS for 1 hour at 4&#x002da;C. The cells
were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and
analyzed with a Coulter Epics-XL flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA)
and Win MDI 2.8 software (Scripps Institute,
La Jolla, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content assay</title><p>ALP activity measurement was performed by
total protein extraction of cells using 200 &#x003bc;L
radio immune precipitation assay (RIPA) lysis
buffer. Then, the lysate was centrifuged at 15000
g at 4&#x002da;C for 15 minutes, after the collection of
supernatant, ALP activity was measured using
an ALP assay kit (Parsazmun, Tehran, Iran) according
to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Activity
of the enzyme (IU/L) was normalized against
total protein (mg). Mineralization, as a late
marker in the osteogenic differentiation of stem
cells, was also quantified. During osteogenic
differentiation, the amount of calcium minerals
deposited on stem cells was measured using
the cresolphthalein complexone method with a
calcium content assay kit (Parsazmun, Tehran,
Iran). Calcium extraction was performed by 0.6
N HCL (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After
the addition of the reagent to calcium solutions,
optical density (OD) was measured at 570 nm.
Calcium content was obtained from the standard
curve of OD versus a serial dilution of calcium
concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</title><p>The difference between the mRNA levels of

cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada).
The cDNAs were used for 40 cycle PCR in a
Rotor-gene Q real-time analyzer (Corbett, Sydney,
Australia). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using
Maxima&#x02122; SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master
Mix (Fermentas) followed by melting curve analysis

iPSCs were also characterized using RT-PCR

healing is being progressed and developed because
of the unique characteristics of these cells, such as
extensive proliferation, differentiation and growth
factor secretion at the site of osseous defects (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Several studies have shown that CD90 (thymocyte
differentiation antigen 1) and CD105 (known
as endoglin) are surface markers that must be expressed
on the surface of the so-called MSCs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
These cells also must lack expression of CD45 and
CD34 which showed their non-hematopoietic origin
(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Flow cytometric data confirmed that
the isolated cells from adipose tissue are mesenchymal.
In the present study, both stem cell types
showed similar patterns of ALP activity during
differentiation into osteoblasts. ALP has a critical
role in osteogenesis due to its role in the cleavage
of calcium phosphate groups and enhancment of
mineralization of the calcium phosphate cements
which are a hallmark of the final osteogenic differentiation
of stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Our ALP
activity data showed that iPSCs have superior osteogenic
capacity compared with AT-MSCs at all
time points. In addition, mineralization data confirmed
the patterns of ALP activity in both stem
cells. Matrix mineralization is a result of continuous
mineral deposition due to ALP activity, crystal
nucleation and precipitation during osteogenic
differentiation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The significant difference observed
between the level of mineralization in iPSC
compared to AT-MSCs suggests that the movement
of iPSCs toward osteogenic lineage is faster
and higher yield. It seems that this effect could be
a result of the high proliferation rate of iPSCs, as
findings from several studies have demonstrated
that one of the most important items in osteogenic
differentiation is confluency of stem cells (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).
Alizarin red staining showed no significant difference
between the two stem cell types. This result
can be explained by the heterogeneous initial cell
seeding and differential rate of cell attachment.</p><p>In this study, three important bone-related genes
were selected and their expression was evaluated
for better comparison and understanding of the osteogenic
differentiation behavior of iPSCs and ATMSCs.
Runx2 is an early osteogenic differentiation
gene marker. Up-regulation and significantly
higher levels of Runx2 were observed on days 7
and 14 in AT-MSCs compared to iPSCs. The superior
mineralization of iPSCs can be explained by
up-regulation of the osteonectin gene due to the
important role of osteonectin expression in initial
crystal growth on stem cells during osteogenic
differentiation. This can also explain the higher
expression of osteocalcin in iPSCs compared to
AT-MSCs. Both stem cell types showed a similar
pattern of expression of osteocalcin, but higher expression
of this gene was observed in iPSCs compared
to AT-MSCs. Therefore, high expression of
osteocalcin and down-regulation of Runx2 and osteonectin
as critical osteogenic genes in both types
of stem cell can be a good predictor of their capacity
for differentiation into osteogenic lineage.
In addition, iPSCs showed better results than ATMSCs
in relation to osteogenic gene expression,
which confirmed the higher osteogenic differentiation
potential in iPSCs compared to AT-MSCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taking all the results together, iPSCs showed
a superior capacity for osteogenic differentiation
than AT-MSCs. Although the capacity for osteogenic
differentiation is an important factor when
selecting the cell source for bone cell-based therapies,
the rate of proliferation and senescence-associated
characteristics should also be considered in
the isolation, expansion and selection process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Stem
