It exerts its function through a signal cascade starting from the integrins that take direct contact with matrix constituents most of which behave as pro-proliferative clues. On the contrary, EMILIN1, a glycoprotein interacting with the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin through its gC1q domain, plays a paradigmatic anti-proliferative role. Here, we demonstrate that the EMILIN1-&#x003b1;4 interaction de-activates the MAPK pathway through HRas. Epithelial cells expressing endogenous &#x003b1;4 integrin and persistently plated on gC1q inhibited pERK1/2 increasing HRasGTP and especially the HRasGTP ubiquitinated form (HRasGTP-Ub). The drug salirasib reversed this effect. In addition, only the gC1q-ligated &#x003b1;4 integrin chain co-immunoprecipitated the ubiquitinated HRas. Only epithelial cells transfected with the wild type form of the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain showed the EMILIN1/&#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1/HRas/pERK1/2 link, whereas cells transfected with a &#x003b1;4 integrin chain carrying a truncated cytoplasmic tail had no effect. In this study we unveiled the pathway activated by the gC1q domain of EMILIN1 through &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin engagement and leading to the decrease of proliferation in an epithelial system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>gC1q domain</kwd><kwd>&#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin</kwd><kwd>RAS-ERK pathway</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Integrins are heterodimeric cell membrane receptors which mediate cell interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The integrins sense the composition and the mechanical tension within the pericellular milieu, and transmit this information intracellularly to signalling pathways which regulate cell fate by influencing cellular motility, apoptosis, differentiation as well as cell proliferation [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Upon engagement integrins rapidly activate signaling pathways mediated by their cytoplasmic domains and proteins with enzymatic activities like RasGTPases are recruited to the sites of cell adhesion to ECM. Integrin engagement by ECM, besides activating the RAS/ERK pathway, also can lead to mobilization of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and influx from the extracellular space [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the early events upon integrin engagement have been deeply investigated, less known are the downstream consequences during persistent cell adhesion. In most cell types the ERK pathway which is activated by RAS is one of the key pathways required to trigger cell proliferation. In order to exert its function RAS is farnesylated and then it associates with the plasma membranes [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. RAS has the inherent ability to undergo conformational changes and functions as a molecular switch that catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP returning it to the inactive GDP-bound state [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among RAS inhibitors shown to be promising in clinical trials [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], salirasib, that is a farnesylthiosalicylic acid specific H-RAS inhibitor, dislodges the RAS isoforms from their membrane-anchoring sites, thereby preventing the activation of the RAS signaling cascade [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>EMILIN1 (Elastic Microfibril Interface Located ProteIN) is a homotrimeric ECM multidomain glycoprotein associated with elastic fibers [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and particularly abundant in skin. EMILIN1 is characterized by a region homologous to the globular domain of C1q (gC1q domain) at the C-terminal end [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] involved in EMILIN1 oligomerization [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and in cell adhesion and migration via interaction with the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To investigate the role of EMILIN1 <italic>in vivo</italic> we generated KO mice and found that the lack of EMILIN1 results in: i) a mild phenotype of lymphatic capillaries [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and vessels [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with increased lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation and ii) a skin hyperproliferative phenotype [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Ligand-activated integrins in general positively regulate cell growth [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, signals emanating from EMILIN1-ligated &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin are anti-proliferative due to the increased levels of PTEN and decrease of pEKR1/2 [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the pathway(s) through which integrin-bound EMILIN1 exerts its negative regulatory function on cell proliferation remain(s) to be fully clarified. For instance, the role and the link between &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 and the small GTPases has not been determined yet.</p><p>In the present study, in order to mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions of cell-ECM interaction, we used a persistent cell adhesion approach to further investigate how the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1/EMILIN1 pair controls cell proliferation. We found that this is exerted via downmodulation of the HRas pathway through the HRasGTP ubiquitination.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Downstream effects of persistent cell adhesion to gC1q</title><p>Phosphorylation of FAK(Tyr925) generates a binding site for SH2 bearing molecules and triggers a RAS-dependent activation of the MAP kinase pathway [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In HaCat keratinocytes persistently adherent to gC1q (i.e. after 24h adhesion) FAK(Tyr925) resulted increased if compared to polylysine attachment, whereas FAK(Tyr397) did not change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). On the contrary, pERK1/2 was dramatically reduced on gC1q at these late times of adhesion. To test if the active form of HRas (HRasGTP) was involved in cellular signals triggered by EMILIN1/gC1q, first a HRasGTP pull-down assay was performed on HaCat cells plated on gC1q or polylysine and analyzed 24h after plating. HRasGTP increased in cells plated on gC1q compared to polylysine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Persistent adhesion to gC1q downmodulates pERK1/2 and upregulates &#x0201c;HRasGTP-Ub&#x0201d;</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

Beside the canonical 21 kDa, RAS proteins display a plethora of faster and slower bands corresponding to the post-translational modified forms or to the mono- (30 kDa) and di-ubiquitinated (40 kDa) forms, respectively [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our experiments the intensity of the 40 kDa band, corresponding to the di-ubiquitinated HRasGTP (HRasGTP-Ub) form, was several-fold higher on gC1q compared to polylysine, suggesting that, following &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin activation as a consequence of cell adhesion to gC1q, HRasGTP could be ubiquitinated.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>The HRas-ERK1/2 pathway is inactivated via the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain</title><p>To determine if the downstream consequences of cell adhesion to gC1q were dependent on a mechanism specifically due to the ligation of the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin, we compared the extent of di-ubiquitinated HRasGTP in cells adherent to gC1q to that detected in cells adherent to collagen type I that uses a different integrin as cellular receptor. As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> both the anti ubiquitin antibody as well as the anti HRas antibody recognized proteins whose migration corresponded to the HRasGTP di-ubiquitinated form. HRasGTP-Ub was 10 times less in cells adherent to polylysine as well as to collagen type I compared to gC1q (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), suggesting that the &#x003b1;4-dependent signaling was qualitatively/quantitatively distinct and specific. Accordingly, while the ratio of HRasGTP-Ub/HRasGDP-Ub was about 0.5 in cells adherent to either polylysine or collagen type I, this ratio was 10-fold in cells adherent to gC1q, indicating that in &#x003b1;4-dependent cell adhesion there is a specific switch from RasGDP to RasGTP.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>The gC1q ligated &#x003b1;4 integrin chain is physically linked to HRas and controls cell growth</title><p>To proof the physiological link between cell adhesion via the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin and HRas we used HaCat cells that endogenously express the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain. We confirmed that the adhesion of HaCat cells to the gC1q or the collagen type I ligands was due to the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 or the &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 integrins, respectively, by performing cell adhesion in the presence of the specific integrin blocking antibodies. Thus, the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 mAb greatly reduced cell adhesion to gC1q and the &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 mAb fully inhibited cell adhesion to collagen type I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>HRas-Ub is co-immunoprecipitated with the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the &#x003b1;4 antibody and immunoblotted with anti &#x003b1;4 antibody and anti HRas antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-08-27034-g002"/></fig><p>Cells were placed on polylysine, collagen type I, or gC1q for 24 hours and at the end of the incubation the cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with the &#x003b1;4 antibody and immunoblotted with anti HRas antibody. As expected, the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain was immunoprecipitated from cells adherent on each ligand; however, the ubiquitinated form of HRas (40 kDa mass) co-immunoprecipitated with the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain only in cells adhered to gC1q (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In fact, a band at the expected molecular mass was detected in the lysate and in the unbound cell lysate when probed with anti HRas antibody. Here, the HRasGTP and HRasGDP ubiquitinated forms cannot be distinguished since the lysates were co-immunoprecipitated and not pulled down for HRasGTP. However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> where the amount of HRasGTP-Ub is much higher than the amount of HRasGDP-Ub, it is very likely that the co-immunoprecipitated HRas-Ub, in cells adhered to gC1q, is primarily due to the HRasGTP membrane-bound form.</p><p>To demonstrate if this pathway (HRasGTP &#x02192; HRasGTP-Ub &#x02192; pERK1/2) was directly linked to the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain, we selected the HT29 and SW480 cell lines that were negative for &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 and positive for &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 integrin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Both cell lines were then stably transfected with either the wild type or an &#x003b1;4 integrin chain deleted of the intracytoplasmic sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). For the following experiments only cells that resulted at least 95% positive for the expression of the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain were used. Both HT29 and SW480 transfected with either the wild type or the deleted &#x003b1;4 form were able to adhere to gC1q although HT29 cells were more efficient than SW480 cells as the percentage of adhesion to gC1q was 90% and 60%, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Thus, for the following experiments we selected HT29 cells. Several clones transfected with either the wild type or the mutant &#x003b1;4 integrin chain were selected and the clones in which the &#x003b1;4 cell surface expression was more stable were further used. We measured the proliferative capacity of the transfected cells grown on collagen type I or EMILIN1/gC1q and found that the proliferation rate (measured as either normalized cell index or doubling time) of the cells transfected with either the wild type or the mutated &#x003b1;4 form was very similar on collagen type I. On the contrary, the proliferation rate was significantly lower on the full length EMILIN1 or gC1q in cells transfected with the wild type &#x003b1;4 integrin chain compared to cells transfected with the deleted form in which the proliferation was not affected at all (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results show that the downstream signaling leading to reduced proliferation following &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1-dependent cell adhesion to the EMILIN1/gC1q ligand depended on a fully functional &#x003b1;4 integrin chain. To link the proliferative and clonogenic capacity to the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin-dependent HRas activity we placed HT29 transfected clones in agar in the presence or in the absence of soluble gC1q. Whereas the colonies of the cells transfected with the wild type &#x003b1;4 integrin chain were significantly less in the presence of gC1q (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), the colonies of HT29 transfected with the mutant &#x003b1;4 integrin grew to the same number under all the experimental conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cells adhere to gC1q through both wt and truncated &#x003b1;4 integrin chain</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

Our explanation is that after its activation HRas-GTP was directed towards ubiquitination. The ratio of HRasGTP-Ub/HRasGDP-Ub in cells transfected with the deleted &#x003b1;4 integrin chain and adherent on gC1q decreased accordingly compared to cells transfected with the wild type &#x003b1;4 integrin chain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), confirming that this pathway depended on the presence of a fully functional &#x003b1;4 integrin chain.</p><p>To prevent HRas pathway activation we interfered with the membrane anchoring of HRas after its farnesylation by treating cells with salirasib.

Thus, FLUO-4 AM was loaded in HaCat cells to determine if there was any variation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during the modulation of the HRasGTP/GDP cycling. Cells persistently plated on polylysine exhibited a higher cytoplasmic amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> respect to cells plated on gC1q (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). When DMSO, that is used as vehicle of salirasib, was added to the cells as control, the cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were changed, i.e. very low in cells persistently adherent to polylysine and, on the contrary, high in cells adherent to gC1q (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). DMSO increased the 40 kDa band, likely the di-ubiquitinated HRasGTP (HRasGTP-Ub), in cells adherent to polylysine (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), whereas this band disappeared in cells adherent to gC1q (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Concomitantly, DMSO upregulated pERK1/2 in cells plated on gC1q, respect to polylysine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). On the other hand, salirasib reverted the downstream effects on both types of coatings respect to the DMSO alone. Of note the finding that the levels of pERK1/2 showed an inverse correlation with the 40 kDa band intensity.</p><p>We then investigated if the inhibition of HRas membrane anchoring and activation by salirasib affected downstream signaling related to cell proliferation. While there was no significant effect on pFAK levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was increased on polylysine when HRasGTP was inibited by salirasib; in contrast, this treatment decreased pERK1/2 levels in cells adherent to gC1q respect to control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

The rescue effect by salirasib was not observed under all other conditions, i.e. salirasib and cells transfected with the truncated &#x003b1;4 integrin chain, DMSO with both types of cells. This demonstrated that, by knocking down HRasGTP and thus HRasGTP-Ub, the signalling produced by &#x003b1;4 integrin engagement loses its antiproliferative cues.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Cells growth in the presence of gC1q is rescued by salirasib</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

This in turn led to the downregulation of pERK1/2 proliferation signals (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> for a schematic representation). The persistent cell adhesion <italic>in vitro</italic> is reminiscent of the <italic>in vivo</italic> condition in which cells are in continuous relationship with the constituents of the ECM. The present findings further explain the peculiar role played by EMILIN1 in the maintenance of cell growth homeostasis in the skin [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The EMILIN1/&#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1/HRas/pERK1/2 pathway was specific for the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1/EMILIN1 pair since cells persistently adherent to collagen type I via the &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 integrin did not show enhanced HRasGTP degradation: consequently, the levels of pERK1/2 were unchanged and the cell proliferation was not affected. Moreover, the finding that the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain was co-immunoprecipitated with HRas-Ub only in cells adherent to gC1q and not to polylysine nor to collagen type I indicated that there was a physical association between the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain and HRas-Ub. The reduction of the downstream signaling by HRas required the full integrity of the &#x003b1;4 integrin chain as HT29 cells transfected with a truncated integrin &#x003b1;4 chain were unable to promote HRasGTP ubiquitination and to affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation and hence cell proliferation.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>A schematic view of the HRas involvement in gC1q-&#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin mediated pathway</title><p><bold>A</bold>. In cells plated on polylysine the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 inactive integrin is not able to induce HRas activation. High basal level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to modulate the activity of RAS and to activate ERK1/2. <bold>B</bold>. Activation of &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin, mediated by gC1q, through FAK induces HRasGTP increase as well as its ubiquitination (HRasGTP-Ub). HRasGTP switching off along with low basal level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is able to reduce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and proliferation. <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>. Salirasib dislodges HRas from plasma membrane preventing its activation and ubiquitination. On the other hand, low levels of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in cells plated on polylysine, lead to low ERK1/2 phosphorylation; on the contrary, high levels of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in cells plated on gC1q rescue the level of pERK1/2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-08-27034-g007"/></fig><p>The fact that in HaCaT keratinocytes persistently adherent on gC1q the salirasib vehicle DMSO increased the low basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> level leading to reduced HRasGTP-Ub and increased pERK1/2, while the opposite was observed on polylysine, indicates that the effects of DMSO were specifically linked to the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin activation by the gC1q ligand. DMSO can induce transient water pores in cell membranes increasing permeability [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> can easily flow through these pores [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is noteworthy that free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a positive regulator of Ras GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) such as CAPRI and RASAL that are responsible for converting HRasGTP to HRasGDP [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; it reduces the levels of HRasGTP and thus of RAS-dependent ERK phosphorylation [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Salirasib, which interferes with membrane achoring of HRas, reverted the downstream effects caused by DMSO on persistently adherent cells.</p><p>The salirasib-induced reduction in the amount of HRasGTP was the consequence of its dislodgment with increased cytosolic HRasGDP form. Nevertheless, the activation of the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin after engagement by gC1q and the ubiquitination of HRasGTP downregulated cell proliferation under both 2D and 3D conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin engagement by the gC1q triggers a series of events leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of HRasGTP. In turn, the loss of HRasGTP is responsible for pERK1/2 downregulation and low proliferation linking the antiproliferative capability of &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin to a proto-oncogene like HRas through the switching off of its activated form.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cells and extracellular matrix ligands</title><p>HaCat (immortalized human keratinocytes) cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Lawrence Banks (ICGEB, Trieste).
